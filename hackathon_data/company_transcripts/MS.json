Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James Gorman","Good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us. I\u2019ll make a few brief introductory remarks and then Jon will take you through the numbers and of course we both as always look forward to your questions.","Our results this quarter reflect solid performance in an improved but obviously still relatively fragile environment. Our team had several objectives coming into the quarter as follows: managing the uncertain macroeconomic environment; continuing the momentum we are building in fixed income while preserving stability in our other businesses; maintaining expense discipline; and obtaining approval for our capital plan under CCAR. By and large, we met these objectives and despite the overall lack of commission in the market, we executed on our strategic plan and performed well in the areas of traditional strength. We saw continued stability and progress in our core businesses with each performing roughly in line with expectations given the environment. We made particular progress in fixed income and commodities where we generated approximately $1.3 billion in revenue, up significantly from the first quarter. Jon will take you through each of our businesses in a moment. ","On expenses, we remain focused on our cost discipline but tactically and through project streamline. We're now a simpler organization and therefore must be leaner and more efficient in our spend. We discussed initiatives that are currently underway last month at our financials conference and are pleased with product streamlines progress to date. Our ROE for the quarter was 8.3% and demonstrated progress towards our 2017 target.","Finally, we received the non-objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2016 capital plan. We believe this decision reflects the changes we undertook as well as our business mix stability. The approval enables us to increase our dividend to $0.20 per quarter and to repurchase up to $3.5 billion in common stock over the next 12 months commencing in the third quarter. CCARs outcome reinforces our aim to steadily increase the return of capital to shareholders over time and indeed it marks the fourth consecutive year in which we have done so. We were also asked to resubmit our plan due to certain deficiencies that the Federal Reserve found in our capital planning process. We're working extremely hard to ensure a successful resubmission towards the end of this year.","On the macro environment a lot was going on. Britain's decision to leave the European Union created uncertainty that is likely to persist for some time as the market grapples with the political and economic paths forward. As we said publicly, we consider this outcome suboptimal, but it did indeed provide us with a live stress scenario as we endured record high volumes and spikes of volatility, our liquidity remains strong, our systems ran smoothly and our clients access the market quickly and in size.","I will now turn over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail and again look forward to your questions in a few minutes.","Jonathan Pruzan","Good morning. As James said, the environment in the second quarter was an improvement over the first. However, we continue to see macro uncertainty and with that periods of heightened volatility. Geopolitical events including Brexit have kept market participants on the sidelines as they wait for clearer trends to emerge. Despite this backdrop, Morgan Stanley delivered solid results.","For the quarter, we reported revenues of $8.9 billion versus $7.8 billion in 1Q. Non-interest expenses for the first quarter were $6.4 billion versus $6.1 billion last quarter. The increase is primarily driven by increased compensation expense on higher revenues. Profit before taxes for the quarter was $2.5 billion versus $1.7 billion in 1Q 2016 highlighting the operating leverage we have in the business model.","Project streamline remains on track. In mid-June James highlighted some of the key initiatives that have been identified to meet our objective of reducing our cost base by $1 billion by 2017. These initiatives will continue to be carried out through the next 18 months but substantial progress has already been made. We continue to leverage our global centers of excellence to optimize workforce costs. We have hired 250 employees with our objective of hiring 1,250 employees through the end of 2017. Offsetting this headcount has come down in our metro higher cost locations. We're 50% complete with our objective to close four North American data centers and are on schedule to close the remaining two by 2017. ","We continually seek ways to deploy technology to drive efficiencies and automation. To that end, we just rolled out a cloud based procurement platform which will drive future savings through more straight through processing and payments, and greater intelligence and purchasing decisions. We continue to show greater discipline around our non-essential travel and have achieved a 50% reduction through the first half of the year as compared to the first half of 2015. ","Turning to Institutional Securities, revenues were $4.6 billion, up 23% quarter-on-quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $1.4 billion for the quarter, essentially flat to the first quarter. Streamline initiatives offset costs associated with rising revenues. Compensation expenses were $1.6 billion. Our ISG year-to-date compensation to net revenue ratio was 36%. We remain committed to our compensation ratio target of less than or equal to 37% we set out at the beginning of the year.","In investment banking, we generated $1.1 billion in revenues, up 12% sequentially. Year-to-date we were number two globally and announced M&A, completed M&A, IPOs and equity and equity linked offerings. Advisory revenues for the quarter were $497 million, down 16% off of a strong 1Q. Dialogue and interest in strategic transactions remain strong but below the 2015 pace. ","M&A announced volumes are running 20% to 25% below last year and we would expect that to persist. Equity underwriting revenues were $266 million, up 66% versus 1Q and debt underwriting revenues were $345 million, up 44% sequentially. Although we saw improvements in underwriting, activity remained below historical levels. As we have mentioned on past calls, we have a healthy pipeline of transactions waiting to be executed. Issuer confidence and investor appetite will be critical for the results in underwriting to improve. In equities, we remained our leadership position and expect to be number one globally with revenues of $2.1 billion, up 4% sequentially.","Second quarter 2016 was a strong quarter across products and regions as we continue to work with our clients through uncertain times. Cash equities was up sequentially. Derivatives remained robust. Prime brokerage continues to be a steady performer and we improved the efficiency of our balance sheet. Fixed income and commodity sales and trading revenues were $1.3 billion, up 49% versus the first quarter. ","Revenues improved sequentially across credit, macro and commodities businesses. Our credit businesses benefited from a tightening of spreads. In particular, securitized products performed well against this backdrop. In macro, we provided support to our clients leading up to and through the Brexit referendum were prudent risk management contributed to higher revenue sequentially. ","Commodities benefited from better credit performance and market conditions, specifically a stabilization in energy credits resulting in an increase in client activity. Fixed income RWAs were $124 billion and SLR exposure was $353 billion in the quarter. Other revenues were up versus first quarter, primarily driven by better credit performance for a held for investment and held for sale relationship loans. ","Lastly, average trading VaR for the second quarter was $46 million, flat to last quarter. VaR was generally range found over the quarter inclusive of Brexit. Wealth management performed well in the second quarter with revenues of $3.8 billion, up 4% sequentially. Even though we have not seen a pickup in retail engagement, this business continues to provide stability against an uncertain macro backdrop. ","Total client assets of $2 trillion increased 2%. Fee based assets hit a new high of $820 billion. And flows in the quarter were $12 billion, up from $5.9 billion in the first quarter. Net interest income was essentially flat sequentially, though up 12% year-over-year. Lending balances were up $3 billion quarter-over-quarter and $11 billion year-over-year. which has resulted in a significant increase in interest income. ","This growth was partially offset by an increase in amortization as a result of a pickup in mortgage prepayment fees as rates declined. Our bank NII forecast that we shared in May remains unchanged and we are on pace with our bank growth target for 2016. Transactional revenues were $798 million this quarter, up 10% sequentially. This improvement was driven by mark to market gains on our deferred compensation plans and not a rebound in activity. ","As mentioned before, transactional activity remains subdued. On expenses, compensation was up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our compensation ratio decreased to 56.5%, which reflects the benefit of our strategy to grow non-compensable revenues. Non-compensation expenses were essentially flat to 1Q. We continue to invest in digital and our infrastructure to ensure compliance with the DOL. ","Our PBT margin for the quarter was 22.5%, up from 21.4% in 1Q 2016. We remain confident we will hit the 23% to 25% pretax margin target we set for 2017, despite the slower than expected pace of future interest rate increases. In investment management, revenues were $583 million, up 22% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter were $517 million, essentially flat versus 1Q. ","AUM was also essentially flat at $406 billion, a continuation of the trend that we have seen over the last several quarters. Investment revenues in the quarter improved to $50 million versus a loss in 1Q 2016, driven by improved performance across a number of funds including private equity and real estate investments. ","Investment revenues remained volatile as global markets and asset prices adjust to the changing political landscape and growth dynamic. Overall, expenses were up 7% quarter-over-quarter driven by higher compensation on investment gains. ","Turning to the balance sheet, total assets were $829 billion at June 30, up from the $807 billion at March 31. This spot increase was driven by a high level of activity at the very end of June, primarily due to Brexit as we supported our clients. We have seen the balance sheet retreat from this high in the first few weeks of the third quarter. ","Pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $365 billion, down from $385 billion in the first quarter. Our pro forma fully phased in advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 15.8% versus 14.6% in the first quarter. Our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was 6.1%, up from 6% in Q1. As James mentioned, during the second quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 23 million shares and our board declared a $0.20 dividend per share. ","Last night, we announced that we will redeem all of the issued and outstanding TruPS by August 18, 2016. The TruPS carry a blended cost of 6.2%. We received approval to redeem these securities in this years\u2019 CCAR. Our tax rate in the second quarter was 33.5%. Going forward we continue to estimate a tax rate of 32%. ","After a difficult start to 2016, the markets and improved in the second quarter. However, the world continues to experience significant geopolitical uncertainty and with that the potential for economic underperformance. The Brexit vote and upcoming US elections have only added to a cloudy outlook. It is too early to predict how the second half will play out. ","On the one hand, the political uncertainty casts a negative shadow over the markets, and will undoubtedly cause some corporations to pause over future Capex and other expansion plans and many investors, particularly individuals remain cautious. On the other hand, the movement in currencies and the improvement in commodity and some equity prices is leading many clients to begin to position for what might be a volatile second half. ","Our pipelines remain healthy and our business is well positioned, but whether this translates into near term business is an open question. As the coming months unfold, we will remain nimble where we see client opportunities, while staying rigorous to our project streamline and other expense initiatives. ","With that, we will open up the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski, with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Guy Moszkowski ","Thank you, good morning.","James Gorman","Good morning Guy.","Guy Moszkowski","First just a question on fixed, obviously a very solid result, and you alluded to post Brexit activity, but generally, if you could comment on the ability to produce $1 billion plus quarterly revenue in say despite as you\u2019ve pointed out the sale of the oil merchanting and the 25% headcount reduction, at the end of last year, is there any warning on sustainability here that you want to issue and if not, maybe just give us a sense for how it is that you could have done a headcount reduction that wasn't as significant as it was and still see revenue in that kind of range.","Jonathan Pruzan","Hey Guy, it\u2019s Jon. I\u2019ll try to tackle that. I think as you know when we laid out our plan in the beginning of the year, we talked about being a critical incredibly size fixed income business that was relevant to our clients, but also supported are other businesses. And what we said is that we were going to - the goal was to maintain our revenue footprint that we had had on an absolute basis in the last couple of years. Year-to-date, our performance is at around $2.1 billion to $2.2 million so it's in-line with that revenue footprint. ","We saw broad support and broad improvement across all the products actually in the second quarter. I highlighted SBG tightening spreads help, strong performance in agencies, FX was aided by the volatility we saw from Brexit, commodities clearly better credit performance we had a much more stable backdrop. Oil prices going from 38 to 48 versus the wild swings that we saw in the first quarter, so broadly a very strong performance. It is only one quarter. In the first quarter when people were talking about our performance we warned that it was only one quarter. We made a lot of changes that we think will help this business and this will take time, but we've been pleased with the progress that we have seen to date.","Guy Moszkowski","So, should we conclude that\u2026 ","James Gorman","I\u2019d just\u2026","Guy Moszkowski","Sorry, go ahead.","James Gorman","I\u2019d just add to it a little bit obvious FIC is sort of the topic of the day the year and the century, it would appear. Listen, my view was that there was a general overreaction to the underperformance of FIC and from the middle of last year through the first half of the first quarter and I saw very little downside risk to the business. When we\u2019re running at 500 million, 600 million a quarter I thought the downside risk is very small. The upside risk was actually quite high. And that's why we said, we thought on a relatively normalized basis, a billion dollar run rate a quarter was entirely reasonable. The headcount we took out at the end of last year actually many of our competitors have taken out headcount and dribs and drabs, so it wasn\u2019t remarkable against the context of what was going on in the market. We just did it at one point in time. ","And clearly we were overstaffed at that point in time. And we came to a fundamental view at the end of last year to do two things, one is to realign the staff for what we thought was a $1 billion run rate business and maybe it's more and maybe we're not going to get ahead of ourselves obviously there's more this quarter. But we don't think it's materially less than that to be honest. ","At the same time, the second thing we did was to align all of our sales and trading businesses together. And with that come lots of operational synergies, risk management synergies, overall management client coverage synergies with our SRM our senior relationship management program and I think that wasn't going to evidence itself in the days and weeks following the realignment, but we felt pretty confident in the months and years following it, it would and maybe we're starting to see some of that. ","Thirdly just on the particular mix of our business, obviously we're more credit centric to macro, but we do have a very good FX business that benefited, you have seen a lot more volatility in rates and clearly the credit markets as Jon said recovered not just in the core fixed income business, but in commodities. So, the combination of all of these things said that yes it's a good number this quarter. Are we shocked by it? Not really. We weren\u2019t nearly shocked when everybody else seemed to be when we were doing $500 million, $600 million. And that's we're not going to get ahead of it. We set a $1 billion run rate and let's see how it plays out over not each individual quarter, but over the next couple of years.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay that answers the question quite robustly thank you. Second big topic of the century in wealth management is that we keep hearing about is robo advice, clearly fees for advice is the core of your wealth management business proposition. A lot of talk about the application of robo advice to different size accounts, how do you intend to protect the franchise against revenue attrition from this type of incursion and are there ways that you can use these types of technologies to your advantage?","Jonathan Pruzan","Guy, first of all, digital is far more than just robo. And as you\u2019ve heard us say in the past we've been spending significant energy and dollars into investing in our digital platforms in wealth management. As you know, we hired Naureen Hassan earlier this year to run that effort for us. We think that the right business model and the winning hand here is a combination of advice in FAs with technology. We\u2019ve been investing heavily in this area. We\u2019ve had some good early progress with some of our mobile apps with some recognition and awards, but there are really three areas that we\u2019ve been focused on. ","One is around data and analytics so providing our clients with better data and analysis so they can more informed and better decisions. Secondly, efficiencies around automation; that will be helpful not only from an expense standpoint, but also giving FAs and clients more time to be together and not focus on paperwork and doing other things like that. And then lastly, most importantly, is how our clients interface with us. ","We have 3.5 million households in our footprint. With many different investing needs, but also many different requirements and idiosyncratic wants and likes, and so we have been building out a broader platform in terms of how we interface with our clients whether that's video, whether that's in person with their FA, whether that's mobile, whether that's text, and we have been doing that for quite some time. So, we have been investing in this area. We've told you it's going to be important to the overall business. We believe secular trends here are for advice with technology. And that's the business that we\u2019re building.","James Gorman","And again just to add to this one because it is a critical question, I think that one has to take into account that the wealth management market in this country is actually extremely diverse. In our own book of business, only 2% I think of our client assets are in households with less than $100,000. We have nearly $800 billion in households with $10 million or more. So you got to look at the segmentation. You got to look at the complexity of the client needs of which access through distinct technologies is a clear need, but it's by no means the only need for folks who\u2019ve got $10 million, $20 million, $50 million. Portfolio allocation superior product access to our underwriting calendar all of the other things, which we bring to the party including our intellectual capital through our research. So, it's a very important development the whole digital development in finance. In my view, it is the most important in the payment sector followed by the consumer credit sector followed by the wealth management sector. But we're making the investments. As Jon said through a digit team that we have hired and on arranged leadership and we have made the investments and will continue making them.","Guy Moszkowski","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.","Brennan Hawken ","Good morning James and Jon.","James Gorman","Good morning.","Brennan Hawken ","One more on and FIC here, you hit on the increased volatility towards the end of the quarter leading into Brexit and then coming out of it. Do you think that that opportunity allowed you to over earn somewhat in FIC this quarter or at least present a more unusual and robust revenue opportunity, which is why you were able to punch above that $1 billion per quarter run rate, and as we think about that run rate seasonally, when we look into the back half, should we think about that being lower or is it going to be less seasonal because of the changes you made to the business?","Jonathan Pruzan","Hi, Brennan. So, the way we would describe Brexit in the impact, I think in the first quarter if you recall and then through sort of the conference season we said that January and February were very challenging markets. March was more stable, a better backdrop for the businesses that we are in, and then April and May looked a lot like March. What we saw in June was sort of a continuation of that trend as we approach the Brexit referendum we saw people start to realize the potential impact of this outcome. And we saw more risk management and hedging activity. And then for the couple of days right before and right after we saw heightened volatility and significant volumes. ","I would tell you that broadly speaking one or two days does not make a quarter for us. It's a much more balanced business than it. Given also all the changes that we made particularly around the Oil Merchanting business and some of the other actions. We would expect less volatility than we've seen in the past. But we are obviously not going to print the billion dollars every quarter on the nose, so we're going to see fluctuations in that number. I wouldn't say that we over earned. I would say that the volume helped for a day or two, but again doesn't drive the overall performance of the quarter. And then, we've been pleased with the results. I don't think that the changes that we made restricted our ability to earn. We weren't constrained in terms of capacity or personnel. And it was a good quarter.","Brennan Hawken","That's really terrific. And then on the seasonality front, how should we think about it just from a modeling perspective? Can you give us any help there?","Jonathan Pruzan","I think it's a little early to call. I would historically tell you that August is generally been a pretty slow month, but we are seeing a lot of new trends this year that we've never seen before. So, I leave it up to you to make those determinations.","Brennan Hawken","Okay.","James Gorman","I would just caution it. From my long experience of doing these calls and discussing fixed income here and observing our competitors it's pretty hard to model quarter-to-quarter every 13 weeks what the fixed income markets are going to do. So good luck with that, but we take a slightly longer term view and again, our base case is billion dollar run rate a quarter we think is what the business should be producing in this time and environment and if it does better than that great, and that's kind of where we are at.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks. Thanks for all that color. That's helpful. And then, a couple on the wealth management business, nice to see a recovery here in the margin. As you think about this business a bit longer term, as well and you think about some of the changes that are coming, from a regulatory perspective, how much do you anticipate your product shelf for commission accounts may be impacted? Could you give us a sense about whether that's going to shrink and maybe frame up how that might shrink and how that might have an impact on revenues, and then whether or not the uncertainty from the fiduciary rule is having any impact on the recruiting market from your perspective.","Jonathan Pruzan","Okay. I think the way that I would try to answer that is a couple of things. One, as you said, we had a nice recovery in the margin that was both driven on the revenue and the expense side. We are confident in our 23% to 25% margin target that we put out there. When we put it out there, we had the draft to the DOL requirements, so we were informed when we put out the targets. I mentioned we have been investing for the ultimate implementation of that new rule. And we also saw this quarter some of the streamline initiatives that are ultimately going to help this business. ","I think we are well positioned for that change. We have the largest advisory platform in the industry. We are making the investments in digital. We do believe as a model Brennan that we're going to have that our wealth clients want advice and they will pay for that advice. But the ultimate mix and shift of products that they want and that they need is going to be a function of time. But we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow this business going forward, even though we have seen lower levels of engagement given the uncertainty in the market.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. And no color on the impact in the recruiting market?","Jonathan Pruzan","You know, I think attrition is clearly running low, and it's been like that for a while. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen any real changes there.","James Gorman","No, it's not going to be affect it.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA, your line is open. ","Mike Mayo ","Hi. Another question related to FIC. The debt underwriting year-over-year performed the worst for you guys versus peers. And the question is, is the reduction in FIC on the trading side impacting the debt underwriting side?","Jonathan Pruzan","I wouldn't say that Mike. I think our debt underwriting business has been a good business for us. We generally perform better from a quarterly perspective, particularly in markets where we see a lot of the non-commoditized that business being robust. In any 13 week period, particularly in low velocity environments, you can get some SKU if you are not in some big deals around the event space. This quarter there were a couple of events that we didn't participate in on the financing because we were on the sell side from an M&A perspective. So that will impact the numbers on a quarterly basis, but again, we feel good about this business. I don't think any of the changes that we've made in fixed income are impairing our ability to do business here. And we are focused on it and we think it's a good business.","Mike Mayo","Second question, retail clients on the sidelines due to Brexit, have they come off the sidelines what are you seeing among retail investors now?","Jonathan Pruzan","I think Brexit is only one event. We've seen sort of subdued transactional revenues for quite some time if you remember it really started back in the summer when we saw some wild volatility in the US markets, but also in Asia and around the world. Those levels have remained low. They picked up a little bit this quarter. It was benefited from some mark to market in our deferred comp. So if you look at the core trends they remain still quite low and subdued. So, I would tell you that we put a good quarter despite the low level of engagement with that we\u2019re seeing. And we haven\u2019t really seen a material pick up just yet. ","James Gorman","I would just add from watching this stuff. I would say the downside risk on the transaction revenue at this point is low. As Jon said it was very subdued in the last several months. The upside risk is whatever it is, if currency engages. So, I don't mean there's a lot of downside from this point, on transaction and we would just see how the macro events that clearly move the investors psychology pretty significantly through this year and as we all know sadly there have been lot of things in the news.","Mike Mayo","And then last question, you had a good quarter, but still just an ROE of 8.3%, I think I heard you reiterate the 9% to 11% target for 2017, so what's left. I guess you have $1 billion of targeted savings for project streamline. How much has been achieved of that and what\u2019s left just in general, how do you still get to that 9% to 11% ROE from here?","James Gorman","Mike, I think we've had this question before. But, listen, it was an okay quarter. I don't, honesty I think it was good in bids. The ROE of 8.3% against the standards that we were shooting pricing was okay. It feels good in this environment, but the 8.3% also recall as Jon pointed out the tax rate was pretty high this quarter. And we had the preferred in there this quarter. So you've got a lot of things going on, is there upside from here? Obviously, we have a pretty concrete game plan on the quarter around going forward around what we can do in wealth management where rates ultimately will impact the pipeline that we have in the investment banking calendar, and I think the broader changes going on in the global investment banking industry. And I think Morgan Stanley is emerging from that pack if you will as one of the institutions that is strengthening at this point. So, but again, we are not speaking to the third quarter numbers here obviously. We are speaking to the outlook as you point out over next year and we stand by our 9% to 11% by the end of 2017.","Mike Mayo","I'm sorry. Project streamline what you have left or what have you achieved?","James Gorman","Yes, it\u2019s still going. There's some very tactical stuff going and Jon might want to talk about where we are in some of the broader project streamline. But we've had, I described the wind so far as being largely tactical stuff that it\u2019s easy to execute. The longer term infrastructure changes are progressing Jon\u2019s, it\u2019s all reporting into Jon now, so why don't I just let him talk about it.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thanks. So Mike, you heard some of the comments in my script about some of the things that we\u2019re doing and the progress we are making. I think the best way to look at it is both comp and non-comp on the non-comp if you look at year-to-date results were down about $350 million versus last year. A good chunk of that related to these streamline initiatives and litigation. There is clearly a benefit unfortunately from a lower revenue number, but there is good progress in the non-comp side. On the comp side, also a reflection of revenues, but as you heard, the ISG comp ratio year to date is 36% versus I think it was 38% ex-DVA last year year-to-date. So good discipline on the comp and good discipline on the expenses and we're confident that we're going to be able to hit the $1 billion target.","Mike Mayo","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open.","Glenn Schorr ","Hi, thanks. One last one on FIC. I know you're not going to give us the number, but I'm looking for anything directional on, profitability must have improved a lot given headcounts down 25%, RWA is down a lot and revenues are now well. I wonder if you could help on any soft comments about overall profitability? ","Jonathan Pruzan ","I think you characterized it well.","Glenn Schorr ","No number. Okay. In the past you've had a lot of seasonality in your FIC numbers. Part of that was the commodities business and you have since sold Oil Merchanting, I\u2019m just curious, not for next quarter, but just as a general comment the pacing of that $4 billion a year target goal, whatever you want to call it. Will it be a little bit more balanced than in the past?","Jonathan Pruzan","I think you highlight the most important factor. This is a volatile business, no doubt that we had incremental volatility given some of the commodities businesses that we were in, so we would expect less volatility, but again, I think we've answered what our goal is in our target for that business.","Glenn Schorr ","Okay Jon. The nice drop in RWA in the quarter is down 5%. 15% year-on-year, but GAAP assets had actually increased, I think in your prepared remarks you said something about supporting client activity related to Brexit, but just curious if you could expand on that a little bit, RWA following GAAP assets up more...","Jonathan Pruzan","Unfortunately, it's just math. We continue to make progress on our initiatives to take out some of the high, higher density if you will RWA assets. At the end of the quarter, we saw a spike as you said supporting our clients, a lot of that was in sort of low intensity RWA assets and that sort of drives the discrepancy there.","Glenn Schorr ","Okay. So the trend of the RWA going down is what you should focus on anyway. And then, maybe last quickie is two quick number ones, in the past I think the difference between your our ROE and your ROTC is in the range of 130, 140 basis points, nothing should change that right, we should be about that same spread now, just because everybody else gives their return intangible I want, just wanted to do apples to apples.","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. Again, it's just math. We\u2019ve got about $9.5 million of average intangibles and goodwill and if you do the math you get that 130 basis points. ","Glenn Schorr","All right, awesome. Thanks Jon.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christian Bolu","Great, good morning guys. So couple more questions on costs. The operating leverage in ISG was pretty impressive. Is that 35.5% comp ratio and remotely sustainable on a go-forward basis if FIC revenues are modestly weaker? And then, also if you can comment on any cost implications of FIC in the CCAR issues?","Jonathan Pruzan","I will go first. I\u2019ll do them in reverse. So on CCAR as James mentioned, we do have to resubmit by the end of the year. That will take some resources both dollars and people. I think it's a little too early for us to try to size that and whether that has an impact on streamline, so we'll come back to you as we get more deeply engaged in that. We clearly have started to work and are focused on it and will dedicate the appropriate or required resources that we need to make sure that we are successful in our resubmission.","On the second point, I think the target that we laid out is the 37% - ISG comp ratio year-to-date 36% I think looking over the total year is more important than any given quarter but we are also benefiting from the headcount changes that we made in the fourth quarter. And we do think that this is a sustainable ratio and that we will continue to pay for talent and be able to retain and attract talent going forward.","Christian Bolu","Perfect, very helpful. I'm not sure if I caught this right, but on the cash equity business, did you say it was up sequentially, pretty surprising given industry volumes were lower just I was curious if you guys gaining share or any particular initiatives anything you can buck the general industry trends.","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, you did hear me correctly. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we were up. We had some improved new issue, volumes were up a little bit that was helpful and less volatility. So yes we were up.","Christian Bolu","Okay, thank you. And then just very quick clean-up question, the trump redemption, what does that show up in the income statement?","Jonathan Pruzan","We announced it last night. We're going to call it's going to be, there are two different call based but by the middle of August that will all be gone. As I said, they carry a $6.20 blended cost and you\u2019ll start to see that in the third quarter \u2013 just the lack of it in the third quarter.","Christian Bolu","But just from an income statement geography perspective, where does that show up? Is that in the treatment revenues?","Jonathan Pruzan","No, that's an interest expense. You will see it in that line, although again, it\u2019s $2.8 billion on a stack of $160 billion or certainly unsecured and then secured debt. So it will flow through that line. It\u2019s clearly helpful since the $6.20 we're issuing depending on tender issuing that closer to 3% to 3.5% at this point. The trucks have lost most of certainly all of their Tier 1 treatment and most of their Tier 2 treatment and that was going to continue to phase out so it's sort of expensive debt at this point which is why we obviously redeemed it. ","Christian Bolu","Okay great. Thank you very much and congrats on a strong quarter.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. Jon, maybe first question, just on the capital ratios you see Q1 up to 15.8, at least in the U.S. obviously at the extreme end. If we do get some opportunity as we get into next year that you get to release a chunk, when you think about where that ratio is, where your SLR is, and if you are able to release capital from a business mix standpoint, do you feel like you guys are where you need to be and the gist of it is if you are able to release the capital obviously you will see one can come down but your SLR will be somewhat impacted. And then just wanted to when you look at the business mix and how you're positioned for that potential opportunity, do you feel like you are situated in a relatively well?","Jonathan Pruzan","I think despite, we clearly put together our business mix and our business model based on the best estimate of what the future is going to look like. We were very happy that we returned more capital this year versus last year, and we\u2019ve done it four years in a row. We're going to continue to try to do that. As you've heard James and I talk about, we are expecting some changes in CCAR. We expect to hear something in this half of the year about how the G-SIB is going to be incorporated into the stress test, how SLR is going to be incorporated into the stress test. So I think there is some unknowns out there in terms of which of these ratios will ultimately be the binding constraint, but I think the business mix that we put together is the right mix and if we have to adapt it we will but it is the right mix to generate 9 to 11 ROE that we are targeting.","Michael Carrier","Okay that's helpful. And then just a quick one on the wealth management business if you will. You guys hit on cost and the margins, I think James you mentioned in terms of the transaction part of the business, they\u2019re relatively low just given retail engagement. On the flipside, it seems like for the industry we will see a continued trend and maybe an accelerating trend from commission based accounts into fee-based account. So just wanted to kind of balance the - what type of growth we could potentially see on that side which is maybe more annuity like versus the more volatile transaction side of business. And then, for the advisors, do you expect any consolidation in the industry and probably away from your type of platform but to other platforms and then some compensation pressure just given the different models out there?","Jonathan Pruzan","So I\u2019ll try to tackle some of the components of that. We have, as you know, we\u2019ve seen a very good trend into fee-based accounts. We are currently at about 40% of our client assets are in fee-based, the 820 which is a new high for us. We saw acceleration of those flows in the second quarter. I think it's a little early to predict what GOL is going to do those flows. There is a scenario that would help accelerate those flows into the fee based businesses, but again it's really around client choice and we\u2019ll see how that plays out. We do believe again the secular trends and a lot of the driving force behind the merger, the acquisition of the Smith Barney platform was that people want advice, and they want and we needed to be of scale. And those are the two drivers that drove that transaction and we're still of the view that that is the longer term trend here. So it's still got time to play out. We feel good about the investments that we are making around the GOL but I think it\u2019s still little early to say. What we have said from a client perspective and a results perspective we do believe it's a manageable impact.","James Gorman","And the industry will keep consolidating because this is a high fixed cost industry.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Matt Burnell","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just I guess an administrative question on the trust preferreds, will there be any charges related to the calling of the trust preferreds?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, we highlighted in our fixed income call that on that redemption. There will be some write down of some amortized fees and we will take that. It's not a material number but there will be a charge for that.","Matt Burnell","Okay, thank you. And then in terms of wealth management, the commission and fee line was down about 4% year-over-year. Even though you do have positive growth in fee-based client account assets, is there a mix shift going on particularly in the fee based client account asset portfolios that is causing a little bit of pressure on the asset management revenue line within wealth management?","Jonathan Pruzan","It's sort of hard to parse through. I think the primary drivers are really the underwriting calendar and the subdued engagement levels that have been driving that activity.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And then just finally from me, could you give us an update on the energy exposure and whether or not that has had any effect on the reported lending balances in the supplement?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. So as I mentioned, better credit performance this quarter than last quarter. From a metric standpoint, we're down to about $30.5 billion in energy loans and commitments. That's down from $14.8 billion last quarter. That\u2019s being driven by pay downs, terminations and sales. The broad characteristics of that portfolio are generally the same, i.e. about 60% of that is to investment grade counterparties, about 30% of that is funded. In terms of the mix that we've given historically around held for investment versus fair value held for sale, the held for sale fair value portfolio is down a little bit. It\u2019s about a 35% that's obviously being driven by some of the sales that we have made in that portfolio. ","E&P also a good story there, down to $3.5 billion from the $4.1 billion that we reported earlier. So we continue to make progress in reducing some of our exposures in that sector. Just as a proxy, last quarter we took about $127 million allowance for loan loss. We told you back then that a lot of that was being driven by our energy exposures. This quarter we took a $3 million allowance. So, clearly much better performance than last quarter.","Matt Burnell","Sure, thank you for the detail. Just one follow-up Jon, you've got about 40% of the portfolio that\u2019s in fair value. How much of the benefit or how much was FIC results benefited from a lower mark-to-market on the energy portfolio specifically?","Jonathan Pruzan","As I said, about 35% of that portfolio is fair value held for sale and that does flow through the revenue line item but I wouldn't say it was significant.","Matt Burnell","Okay thank you very much.","Jonathan Pruzan","I'm sorry. It\u2019s the other revenue line item.","Matt Burnell","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. Can you give an update on the bank effort in wealth management? You have continued good loan growth this quarter, deposits were down a little bit versus last quarter but still up nicely year-over-year. Just how you're feeling about the outlook for both loan and deposit growth going forward.","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. So as I mentioned, $3 billion of loan growth this quarter, $5 billion year-to-date, continued good growth there and I think we feel pretty good about that trend. As I mentioned, our NII guidance that we gave as part of the fixed income deck, we still feel good about that. On the deposit side, second quarter we usually see a dip that\u2019s being driven by the tax season. So at $150 billion, down $2 billion that was a primary driver. I think the investments that we are making into digital and some of the cash management products make us feel good about our ability to continue to grow broadly our deposit base and again I think the bank strategy has been a real bright spot for us and we would expect that to continue going forward.","Matt O'Connor","Just a couple of number clarification questions. How much were the mark-to-market gains on the deferred comp and wealth management this quarter? And are there offsets on the expense side or is that \u2013 does not follow the bottom line?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, there are definitely offsets on the expense side. It's generally the net impact is generally reasonably small, and we don't break out that number given the relative size.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then just lastly, the premium amortization that was a drag within wealth management, what was that this quarter versus last quarter or recent periods?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, it was clear as rates drop this quarter, prepayment fees increased and that was the driver of it in the first quarter and rates were pretty stable. So again, that was what caused the NII to be flat this quarter.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. But you won\u2019t give the magnitude of that?","Jonathan Pruzan","No.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Jim Mitchell","Hi, good morning. May be we could just sort of dig into the RWA decline this quarter, I think you were down $20 billion, FIC was down $8 billion, so you actually had more outside of FIC. So when I think about high density RWA, I think typically that would be more in FIC. So just maybe help us understand where the RWA decline is coming outside of FIC and is there more of that to go?","Jonathan Pruzan","I think the $20 billion, another way to think about it is about half of that came from credit RWAs and that was a combination of FIC mostly in the securitization area but also from event. Lending, our balances are down in that business given the light activity. And then the other half was really around the market RWAs which is a function of both the balance as well as the stress bar which was down a little bit.","Jim Mitchell","Is that sustainable outside of FIC the stress bar and those kind of drivers or is there more to go I guess outside of FIC? Because we know your targets are FIC I'm just trying to get a sense of the non-FIC?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, on the non-FIC the event is going to be driven by activity level. So I think the RWA number that we used was, I don't even remember, in the mid 350s and that number I think is sustainable given what we see in the outlook.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, so it's going to be episodic?","Jonathan Pruzan","It will be but I wouldn\u2019t expect to see dramatic movements unless there is significant changes in volatility. I think the composition of our book as you said we are making some minor, we continue to bring down our FIC RWAs but we made a lot of progress there, so I would expect it to be pretty comparable.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. In this year's CCAR exam, it looked like your leverage ratio was under the adversely stress scenario, but I was approaching the lower bound and obviously that might be exacerbated a bit by the capital return although maybe there's some [indiscernible]. But could you just clarify how you're thinking about leverage particularly as it relates to the regulatory regime?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. I covered a little bit of this in one of my prior answers. I think what you have to remember we are managing multiple ratios. We have the risk weighted asset ratios, we have the leverage ratio, we have SLR, how that gets incorporated into CCAR is going to be important. But I think the critical point to recognize here is we did increase our capital return this year and our minimum ratios through the stress test actually improved across the board, both the Tier 1 and RWA ratios but also the leverage ratio was up about 30 basis points. So we continue to accumulate capital and that's really a reflection of the business mix in the de-risking that we\u2019ve undertaken.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. Thank you for that. Another project streamline question, are the costs being removed more or less coincident with the initiatives, or are the initiatives sort of proceeding it and over the many 200 or so that you\u2019ve identified, how many of them are in process and how far along what ending are we in in terms of the actual initiatives themselves?","Jonathan Pruzan","I think these are being - these are proactive actions that we are taking, so I think we are driving this change. I mentioned the datacenters that we're closing, the workforce deployment strategy that we are implementing. So these are proactive steps that we are taking given the simplification of our business model. In terms of innings, I would say unclear. We are in the early stages, we made progress and we are confident on reaching our $1 billion target in 2017.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much.","Jonathan Pruzan","Not a big baseball fan.","Eric Wasserstrom","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Nomura. Your line is open.","Steven Chubak","Hi, good morning.","Jonathan Pruzan","Good morning.","Steven Chubak","Jon, I wanted to follow-up regarding some the questions on capital. So first on the G-SIB surcharge, it looked like as of year-end, you are right on the cusp of the 3% threshold. And given the reduction that we've seen over the last couple of quarters and many of your more risk intensive assets, where do you believe the surcharge is today and how you are thinking about managing to that going forward given some of the opportunities not just to mitigate but potentially to even grow in some of the trading areas as competitors return?","Jonathan Pruzan","As you said, our surcharge for 2016 is 3%. As we said in the past, we're going to continue to try to manage and mitigate that if we can. And so if there are opportunities to bring that number down or change that number, we will obviously take a hard look at it.","Steven Chubak","Got it, okay. And then, one follow-up regarding some of the remarks you made to Eric\u2019s last question. Given that leverage was your binding constraint in the latest exam and that the Fed is incorporating as you noted a tougher SLR requirement, it still looks to us that even if we include the G-SIB surcharge in full pre-mitigation that the SLR or leverage could still be your binding constraint. And I just want to get a better sense as to whether the mitigation plans that you outlined are still on track I believe it was at the early part of the year and the strategic review on the SLR within FIC and are there other opportunities that you see to drive that lower given that that could actually prove to be the determinant of how much capital you need to hold?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, I think I tried to answer this question clearly not as well as people had liked. Until we actually see what the new requirements are in CCAR, that question is challenging. We do have initiatives in place in fixed income to bring down the SLR. We did build capital on a leverage ratio this year versus last year through the test how the SLR is incorporated will be a driver of some of the decisions we make going forward. And the buffer is as you know is on the risk weighted asset ratios, not on the leverage ratio. So I think we need to see a little bit more before we can be more precise.","Steven Chubak","Thanks, Jon. And one follow-up for me on the wealth management side. James, actually at the Morgan Stanley financials conference, you made a comment regarding loan penetration levels among some of your retail clients. I think the numbers were 2% for mortgage and 16% for SBLs. The 16% number actually struck me a bit high and yet we continue to see really strong growth within that channel. As we think about modeling out the long term growth opportunity here, what should we think or what do you believe a reasonable penetration level that you can achieve across both of these channels to drive further growth?","James Gorman","I don't know that I want to try and put out a penetration on this be it loans. I actually don't agree that it's a high number. It reflects the mix in the business as you move from single stock marginal lending to portfolio annuitized asset based lending. The SBL is going to go up and margin as you would think would go down, actually our margin book has been relatively stable, but the SBL is just a function. We have a lot of wealthy clients who have positions they don't want to liquidate, they want to invest in other things, they want to use money for lots of different sources and whether it's purchasing assets or whatever, so I'm not terribly surprised by it [indiscernible].","Steven Chubak","That's very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.","James Gorman","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's Q&A session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Jonathan Pruzan","I think we're good to everybody. Thank you. We will see you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation."],"15110":["Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Q4 2011 Earnings Call January 19, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Celeste Brown - Managing Director","Ruth Porat - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Member of Operating Committee","James P.

This is Celeste Brown, Head of Investor Relations at Morgan Stanley. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements, which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The presentation may also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings at www.morganstanley.com for a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley. ","This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instruments. ","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James P. Gorman","Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, everyone. As we say goodbye to 2011, we are happy to report that our prospects are much better going forward than they have at any point since I became CEO 2 years ago. Let me briefly review the year and share our outlook. ","We know -- as you all know, we had a disappointing start to 2011 when we suffered a considerable loss in the Japanese joint venture. However, it proves to be a positive catalyst because it helped MUFG and ourselves reevaluate our partnership and determine that we should take steps to align the 2 companies more closely. The result was the creation of what I believe is one of the most exciting partnerships in the global financial services industry. The partnership bore abundant fruit in 2011, including the conversion of the preferred into common; the elimination of the preferred dividend, and now MUFG equity counts through our earnings; MUFG now has 2 board seats; the enhancement of a loan marketing agreement for the Americas; and we're continuing to look for other ways to expand this partnership around the world. All of these show our commitment to each other for decades to come in good times and in bad. Now taking you through this in detail, because I believe our deeper relationship is perhaps the most underappreciated of all the strategic moves that have taken place. ","On the business front, we had terrific progress against our goals in 2011. In particular, look at equities. The growth in our share in equities, where we increased wallet significantly, with a more than 300 basis point increase in the first 9 months. ","We grew share in Fixed Income. We also increased our wallet share in this business, as has been our focus, while deemphasizing certain parts of securitized products and other Basel III capital-intensive areas. ","We grew our share in Investment Banking capital markets, where we achieved 100 basis point improvement in overall wallet share and significant positions in all of the rankings. We improved our margin and flows in Smith Barney. ","While margin improved modestly for the year to 10%, net managed flows were the highest since the inception of the JV at $43 billion. ","We are now moving to the final stages of integration of MSSB. Our technology platform will be fully integrated this summer. ","We revitalized MSIM, which is evident in the flows in that business for the year and our momentum exiting the fourth quarter after several years of outflows. ","Finally, we restored Research through its preeminent place in the industry, where we have seen improved Greenwich rankings and II rankings through the year. ","On the organization front, we sought stability in management and a successful transition among our senior team. That has been done. ","On the legacy front, we resolved the last major significant issue for us, MBIA, which was settled through the difficult decision to take a loss of $1.7 billion. But most importantly, in the process, we freed up approximately $5 billion of capital pro forma under Basel III. ","We also continue to tightly risk-manage our exposure to the periphery, with exposures before hedges well below where we ended the third quarter. Ruth will review this with you in detail in a minute. ","In addition, we've reshaped our balance sheet. Consistent with our commitment to you when I took this job, we exited 2011 with no outside risks and have fortified with a much stronger balance sheet. ","With regards to compensation, 2011 represented a high-water mark for our deferrals due to the unusual aggregation of prior periods into this year. We are acutely aware of the impact of deferral decisions on future periods. But with the last year behind us, we will have more flexibility in the years to come. ","Ruth will address the meaningful progress we made with respect to capital, funding and liquidity. But let me end with a few brief comments. First, this management team was determined to clear the decks of significant legacy issues and material exposures from 2008 and prior years. And we have done that. For the first time in 2 years, our to-do list is not our problem list, and we can focus our energies on enhancing our franchise. Second, this management team is determined to gain share in the businesses we have chosen to remain in, and we are doing that. In addition, we're assuming we come to acceptable terms, we would look to purchase the next 14% of MSSB. ","Finally, this management team is resolute in its goal to generate acceptable and clean returns in quarters and years ahead. The recent decision to execute a reduction in force of 1,600 employees, as well as the ongoing reshaping of Fixed Income, are examples of important steps to achieving better performance on a sustainable basis. ","We cannot control the accounting noise of DVA, the movement of counterparty spreads, the capital requirements imposed by our regulators or the evolving Dodd-Frank regulatory framework. However, there is a tremendous amount that we can and do control, and we will remain nimble, highly focused and disciplined in doing so. 2011 was a very difficult year for the markets and for the financial services. We are very glad to have it behind us. Although the markets remain fragile, Morgan Stanley is dramatically better positioned than it was just 12 months ago. ","With that, I'll now turn over to Ruth to take you through our earnings in greater detail.","Ruth Porat","Good morning. As James said, we are particularly pleased this quarter with the steps we have taken to address legacy issues and position the firm for the future. Given the magnitude of the loss associated with the MBIA settlement, a $1.7 billion reduction to revenue and approximately $0.59 to EPS, to simplify comparisons to prior periods, I will provide reported numbers but then also provide certain amounts excluding the impact of the loss to help with comparability. Additionally, I will provide data with and without the impact of DVA. ","Our firm-wide revenues for the fourth quarter were $5.7 billion, down 42% sequentially on a reported basis and down 15% when excluding DVA in both periods. DVA in the quarter was $216 million. Excluding the MBIA loss and DVA in both periods, revenues of $7.2 billion in the fourth quarter were up 12% over the third quarter. Our noninterest expenses were $6.2 billion, virtually unchanged from last quarter. The firm-wide compensation ratio was 67% in the quarter compared to 37% in the third quarter. Excluding the effect of DVA in both quarters and the MBIA loss this quarter, the ratio was 53% in the fourth quarter versus 57% in the third quarter. We expect to incur $150 million of severance expense due to the recently completed reduction in force that James mentioned. ","Non-compensation expenses were $2.4 billion, down 6% from last quarter. Although we have historically experienced a seasonal increase in non-compensation expenses in the fourth quarter, firm-wide discipline resulted in the sequential and year-over-year declines. ","Overall for the quarter, income from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley was a loss of approximately $227 million. Net loss from continuing operations per diluted share was $0.14 after preferred dividends. DVA positively affected our results by approximately $0.06 per share. And as I mentioned, the MBIA loss negatively impacted our results by $0.59 per share. Period-end shares outstanding were 1.93 billion, while our diluted average shares outstanding were 1.85 billion. Book value at the end of the quarter was $31.42 per share and tangible book value was $27.95 per share. ","Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $750 billion at December 31, down from $795 billion last quarter, reflecting lower client activity. The liquidity pool was $182 billion at the end of the quarter and has remained at or above those levels, even after paying down $2.5 billion of debt in early January. Although our calculations are not final, we believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I will be approximately 13% versus 13.1% in the third quarter, and our Tier 1 capital ratio will be approximately 16.6% versus 15.1% in the third quarter. Risk-weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately $316 billion at December 31. The change in RWAs from last quarter reflects the impact of the MBIA settlement, our move away from RWA-intensive businesses and the reduction in the balance sheet. ","You'll note that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I is down slightly from last quarter despite the significant reduction in our RWAs. This was driven by 2 adjustments to Tier 1 common. First, the dilutive impact of the MBIA transaction under Basel I, as we indicated when we announced the MBIA settlement. Second, a release by the Federal Reserve in December in which the regulatory definition of Tier 1 common capital was formalized to require the reduction of goodwill and nonservicing intangible assets associated with non-controlling interests. This means that we deduct $4.2 billion of goodwill associated with MSSB and NCI. There is no impact to our Basel III ratios from this change because our current and future estimates of Basel III capital reflect the deduction of NCI. ","We continue to build our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III, which was approximately 8% pro forma as of the end of the fourth quarter. Assuming full Basel III inflation of RWAs, no benefit from mitigation and unfavorable treatment of NCI. In addition, we expect to have a Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III of close to 10% at the end of 2012, reflecting passive mitigation driven by position rolloffs and consensus earnings. ","Now turning to our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, reported revenues of $2.1 billion were down 68% from last quarter, including the $1.7 billion negative impact related to the MBIA loss that flowed through our Fixed Income business. Excluding the impact of DVA in both periods and the MBIA loss this quarter, revenues were up 20% sequentially. Noninterest expenses were $2.9 billion, down 4% from the third quarter. The compensation ratio was 75% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of DVA and the MBIA loss, the ratio was 43%. Non-compensation expenses declined 10%. The business reported a pretax loss of $779 million. ","Turning to Investment Banking. Our results reflect our strong market positions against the backdrop of generally low market activity, resulting in revenues of $883 million, up slightly versus last quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked #1 in global completed M&A, #2 in global announced M&A and #2 in both global equity and global IPOs. Notable transactions included Kinder Morgan's $39 billion acquisition of El Paso Corporation, Groupon's $805 million IPO and Amgen's $6 billion investment-grade debt offering. ","Advisory revenues of $406 million were roughly flat to the third quarter as higher revenues in the Americas offset lower results in EMEA. Equity underwriting revenues were $189 million, down 21% versus the third quarter, driven in particular by lower activity in Europe. ","Fixed income underwriting revenues of $288 million increased 36% from last quarter. Results primarily reflected a higher loan syndication activity and investment-grade bond revenues. ","Equity sales and trading revenues of $1.3 billion included negative DVA of $23 million and were down 36% versus last quarter on a reported basis. Excluding DVA, revenues were down 5% sequentially and were up 8% from a year ago. ","Although market volumes and liquidity declined in the fourth quarter with the Eurozone crisis weighing on client activity, our client revenues remained relatively resilient, and we successfully navigated the turmoil. The fourth quarter results capped a strong year overall for the equities business. Specifically, cash equities and electronic trading volumes, in particular, outperformed broader market volumes. After 3 sequential record quarters, derivatives were down in a seasonally weaker period. Prime brokerage revenues similarly reflected typical fourth quarter seasonality and lower market levels in the quarter. The number of clients remained unchanged from the prior quarter and up from the prior year. ","Fixed Income and Commodities sales and trading negative revenues of $257 million included positive DVA of $239 million and the negative $1.7 billion impact from the MBIA loss. Revenues were down 107% on a reported basis. Excluding DVA in both periods and the MBIA loss this quarter, revenues were up 13% versus last quarter and up 52% versus a year ago. We continue to increase share in our focus areas and position the business for Basel III. The investment in our rates franchise maintained its momentum with revenues up modestly sequentially and up materially year-over-year. FX results were modestly lower than last quarter and up significantly year-over-year. ","Our credit businesses recovered from a weak performance in Q3 but were still down materially versus the year ago. Commodities revenues were lower due to unseasonably mild Northern Hemisphere temperatures and slower global GDP growth. Results in the Fixed Income business were positively affected by the release of credit valuation adjustments due to the restructuring of certain peripheral exposures. The other sales and trading line reflects revenues of $83 million versus a loss in the third quarter. ","Turning to VAR. Average VAR decreased from $130 million in the third quarter to $123 million this quarter using a 4-year data series. Period-end VAR declined from $143 million at the end of Q3 to $87 million at the end of Q4. Total trading VAR was down at period end in large part due to the MBIA settlement closing towards the end of the quarter. Related positions were captured in credit portfolio VAR. Our average aggregated VAR by primary risk category for the quarter was $66 million versus $93 million in the third quarter, reflecting reduced activity, particularly in credit products. ","Global Wealth Management revenues of $3.3 billion were roughly flat to the prior quarter, in a period marked by low client volume and a headwind of lower market levels at the end of the third quarter. Specifically, Asset Management revenues were down 7% because fees are based on asset levels at the close of the prior quarter. GWM's Investment Banking-related fees were relatively flat to last quarter, in line with the firm's underwriting revenues. Trading revenues were up significantly versus Q3, primarily driven by markups in deferred compensation plans, although it is important to note that this increase was offset nearly 1-for-1 in the compensation expense line. Commissions were down 6% from last quarter, reflecting reduced levels of client activity. The other revenue line includes lower realized AFS gains compared to the prior quarter. Net interest was up 12% sequentially, attributable to the continued buildout of our lending business and performance of our investment portfolio. Noninterest expenses were $3 billion, up 4% from last quarter. ","The compensation ratio of 64% in the quarter continues to be driven primarily by the formulaic payout grid but was elevated this quarter by the revenue mix, certain year-end adjustments and severance charges. Non-compensation expenses were $932 million, up from $896 million in the third quarter, reflecting seasonality and more normalized FDIC expenses, as I mentioned on our last earnings call. Integration costs were approximately $73 million in the quarter. ","Profit before tax was $244 million, while the PDT margin was 8%, which reflected the revenue mix and the expense movement I mentioned. NCI for the quarter was $16 million, down from $52 million in the third quarter. Total client assets increased to $1.6 trillion due to market appreciation and net asset inflows of $6 billion in the quarter. Global fee-based asset flows were $4.9 billion. Fee-based assets under management grew to $496 billion at quarter end, up 6% year-over-year. Global fee-based asset inflows for the full year were $43 billion, the highest since the inception of the JV. We are focused on growing this portion of flows because they enable to us deliver the best of our content to clients while building stable fee revenue and are more relevant to the economics of the business. ","Global representatives at quarter end were 17,156, down just over 130 sequentially. In preparing for the move of Smith Barney advisors onto the new platform, we reviewed and harmonized role definitions for Morgan Stanley and Smith Barney FAs, resulting in an increase of approximately 500 in the FA count as shown in our supplement as global representatives adjusted. Our disclosure going forward will provide the FA count using the new methodology. Turnover in our top 2 quintiles was at the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2009. Bank deposits were $111 billion at the end of the quarter with approximately $56 billion held in Morgan Stanley Banks. ","Turning to Asset Management. Revenues of $424 million were up from $205 million in the third quarter, due primarily to markups in the Merchant Banking and Real Estate funds this quarter versus sizable markdowns last quarter. In Traditional Asset Management, revenues of $290 million were flat to the third quarter. In Real Estate Investing, revenues of $111 million compared favorably to the prior quarter, which included markdowns on investments. Given the ownership structure of these funds, the majority of these revenues are passed to third-party investors in the non-controlling interest line. In Merchant Banking, revenues of $23 million were up from third quarter results, which included markdowns related to declines in global markets. ","Compensation expense was $183 million in the quarter, up from $132 million in the third quarter, driven primarily by favorable markups in deferred compensation plans. Profit before taxes was $78 million. NCI was $44 million versus negative $18 million last quarter, again reflecting markups in funds versus markdowns in Q3. Total AUM increased $19 billion sequentially to $287 billion, driven by net asset inflows of $15 billion and market appreciation. Net asset inflows included $8 billion of net inflows into AIP funds, leveraging both the institutional sales force as well as the MSSB platform and $7 billion of net inflows into liquidity funds. ","With respect to our exposures in the European periphery in France, we have provided updated and expanded disclosure in our earnings supplement. Specifically, we added a column for unfunded commitments, which are now included as a component of our exposure before hedges and our net exposure. Previously, we disclosed unfunded commitments in a footnote. ","For the most part, the unfunded commitments and the exposures excluding the unfunded commitments are consistent with the prior quarter. The notable change is with respect to Italy. In December, we began to restructure certain derivative positions and amendments to those positions settled in January. As a result, our Italian exposure was higher at year end relative to the third quarter. However, as we highlight in the footnote to our exposure schedule, upon settlement in early January, the exposures declined materially. Thus, the data in the footnote most accurately reflect our positions post settlement. Following settlement of the restructuring and excluding the unfunded commitments, our comparable exposure to last quarter for the periphery are $4.3 billion before hedges and $2.3 billion net of hedges. For France, our comparable exposure the last quarter are $1.7 billion before hedges and less than $100 million net of hedges. ","In conclusion, I will end where James started. We are focused on that which we can control. The markets continue to be affected by ongoing uncertainty in the Eurozone. However, the strategic steps that we took in 2010 and 2011 cleared out legacy positions and enabled us to focus our attention on building on the momentum we have across our businesses. Notably, these strategic steps have both a P&L benefit as well as a balance sheet benefit, reducing our funding needs. Our banking pipeline is healthy globally. Our equity business continues to distinguish itself. Our Fixed Income business is on its way to reestablishing itself as a market leader in the areas we have targeted, where we continue to focus on capital efficiency and balance sheet velocity. Our Wealth and Asset Management businesses begin 2012 well positioned to leverage 2011 flows, the highest in some time for both businesses. The steps we took also fortified our capital ratios, beginning in the first half of the year with the MUFG equity conversion and ending the year with the MBIA settlement, providing additional capacity to deliver for our clients. ","Our strategic moves have resulted in diversification of our funding sources, allowing us significant degrees of freedom. Because of our increased funding diversification, our plain vanilla debt issuance should be meaningfully lower than last year as we benefit from efficiencies available from additional channels, such as we have $66 billion of wholly owned deposits across the firm, a benefit of our MSSB joint venture. Deposits are an attractive source of funding, not only for our loan book but increasingly for certain derivatives, which we are moving into the bank consistent with new regulations, including Dodd-Frank. ","Our relationship with MUFG opened a new funding channel for the firm. We issued Uridashi bonds through our joint venture in Japan in the last 2 quarters. With our ongoing shift to more liquid flow businesses, we reduced the number of assets that require unsecured debt funding or what we refer to as cash funding per our asset liability management governance. And we have incremental flexibility in our liquidity pool because our rolling 12-month maturities will be $10 billion lower at the end of the first quarter versus the peak in September of 2011, thus lowering our funding needs by a portion of that amount. ","Now in 2012, with legacy problems behind us, we are relentlessly focused on maximizing the return levers of our franchise. We have momentum in our businesses. We have and will continue to show discipline with lower noncomp expenses and have our peak compensation deferrals behind us. ","Thank you for listening. And James and I will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","James, your comments on capital management seemed more definitive on proceeding with the first phase of the buy-in, where previously it seemed you were a bit more open to kind of buying back the stock. Am I reading that correctly? And if so, what's driving that change in thinking?","James P. Gorman","Well, I think, listen, the first tranche is only 14%. It is a core plank in our overall corporate strategy, which we've made very clear. We're very happy with the business. I know the margins aren't where we'd all hope they'd be at this point. But the stability of the revenues, the stability of the asset flows and the stability of the managed money gives us great confidence in the business. And frankly, we're getting close to the end of the integration period. So in a tradeoff between sort of financial management being a short-term decision around buybacks versus a long-term strategic management bides [ph] us on the long-term strategic management, which is the first tranche of the purchase. Now all of that said, it's subject to price and it's subject to an appropriate price at fair market value. So if we felt that we couldn't come to appropriate terms, we wouldn't move ahead with it. We have no problem with that.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And what about both? Would it be a disappointing outcome if you had to choose between either doing the first phase or repurchasing the stock this year?","James P. Gorman","Listen, from my perspective, you'd take these things sequentially. I think that you have plenty of opportunities to move forward with buying back stock, raising dividends or buying the remainder of Smith Barney. And what we have tried to do, as a firm over the last couple of years, is be very steady and methodical and take one step at a time.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then in equities, you both highlighted the share gains within the business over the recent year quarters. But could you just elaborate on what businesses and\/or regions have been the primary contributors and how sustainable you believe those share gains to be?","Ruth Porat","So we've had actually strength globally and across the products, as I noted, and are pleased with the strength of the global team. I think that as we've gone through the year, you've heard it on both the banking side and the sales and trading side, given the ongoing overhang of issues in the Eurozone, that's been a more challenging market, but real breadth across -- around the globe.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then Ruth, quick one on the numbers on that $600 million crystallized CVA gain this quarter. Can you help quantify what losses to date were on those exposures prior to this quarter's gain?","Ruth Porat","I don't have that. But that is, as you characterized, it's a reversal of prior losses that have bled through the P&L.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, finally. And then I know it's early in the year, but could you just give a flavor for how businesses is progressing? One of your peers mentioned yesterday, business was about the same as the beginning of last year, and wanted to get your thoughts on that.","Ruth Porat","Well, with the caveat that it is -- 2 weeks is not a quarter, I would say that we ended the year feeling better about the state of the markets. There's a lot of cash on the sideline from clients. Our banking pipeline is very healthy. The equity new issue pipeline, in particular, has been on hold for quite some time, given the volatility in the market last year. The M&A pipeline is healthy. So with that very large caveat that 2 weeks is not a quarter, it's feeling a bit better. But I come back to that point, there's still uncertainty in the Eurozone, there's still issues in the macro environment. We're feeling better, but it's still early.","James P. Gorman","And I would just add to that on the broader economic front, that our view has been that the U.S. is a little better off than has generally been perceived, and that Europe is more likely than not to resolve itself, although over a period of a couple of years, not a couple of weeks, which was our sort of collective attention span in the fall. So against that macro outlook, it is -- we are as Ruth said.","Operator","The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","If you could elaborate a little bit more on MUFG. You commented on the funding. What's your intention in highlighting that so much at the top of today's call? Is it that they are there -- someone with deep pockets if you needed some extra help? Or am I just missing the point?","James P. Gorman","No, listen. How many times in the history of financial services have you seen a cross-border equity investment from one bank to another of this kind and the merger of different parts of their businesses, which we do with our securities business in Japan? And so number one, there is a strategic story here. Number two, the conversion obviously improved our capital and reduced a mandatory dividend that we were paying. And I just felt -- and maybe I'm the only one who felt this, but I felt that the world at large did not appreciate both the strategic and financial value of this transaction. And they are the second largest depository institution in the world. I think they have 70% more deposits than any U.S. institution. I may be incorrect on that, but I think I'm roughly correct. And I think because they're in Japan, they're just not just as well understood if frankly they're in our backyard. They're great partners and they have worked hard with us over the last several months to find ways to do business together. And I think that's a strategic imperative for us, to keep growing with them as partners in finding ways to do business around the world. And I just felt it was important to get that message out there.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Right. And then one separate question. When you think about rightsizing the firm, the company has hired many employees in the past few years. And now you need to reduce employees, it's always very difficult in markets like this, but can you talk about the tradeoff between rightsizing for the current cycle and investing for the long-term?","Ruth Porat","So we were focused on -- have been focused on the pacing of the recovery. It continues to be slow. We, therefore, felt it was appropriate to reduce headcount. But that reduction is very consistent with what we've been describing strategically and it's quite targeted. So we've been judicious in investment areas, particularly within sales and trading. So for example, in rates, which has obviously been a focal area, and as I noted, up again this quarter, up year-over-year. We've continued to make key hires in research and trading to protect and support those growth areas. We've also been making, taking steps deemphasizing and reducing balance sheet and risk in areas that are inefficient under Basel III. So for example, within our sub-investment grade securitization through 2011, we were reducing risk, which not only freed up capital and liquidity but enabled us to make some headcount reductions. But we have a strong team there that's been proactive and repositioning the business. And now they are focused on those portions within securitization, the higher-quality credit quality tranches that actually are quite consistent with the new Basel III regime. So what we've tried to do is really strike that right balance between reducing headcount where we were could, while making sure we're well positioned for the recovery, which as James said, hopefully comes sooner rather than later.","Operator","The next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to ask you if you could elaborate a little bit on some of the headwinds that you had in 2011 from sort of multiple years of deferred comp. And if you can just give us a little bit more granularity on how that rolls off after 2011, in 2012 and beyond.","Ruth Porat","So in Institutional Securities, we did take comp down meaningfully per person this year. And as we said in the fourth quarter of last year call, we increased the deferral rate to 60% for 2011 versus 40% previously and made a number of other changes. This resulted in a higher comp expense in 2011, notwithstanding the decrease in comp per person, because 2011 was a transition year with an unusual aggregation of deferrals coming into 2011. But as James said, when we look at that deferral schedule going out from here and going most important into 2012, prior year deferrals normalize, and in fact, decline in 2012, and we do have more flexibility. So it's really about 2011 being that transition year.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. Is there any more sort of quantification that you can provide us as we try to accurately reflect this in our model?","Ruth Porat","No, we're not doing that.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Wanted to ask about the Global Wealth Management and the divergence in the fourth quarter of the revenue versus the expense trend. I think you did cover it a little bit. But it was a pretty meaningful divergence, not for the full year but certainly for the fourth quarter. And yet I would hope that by now we would be starting to be able to see some of the benefit of the efficiency movements that you've made and being able to take advantage of the single platform.","Ruth Porat","Fair point. I mean, fundamentally we had consistent revenues, which underscored the stability of the business. But as James said, the margin wasn't quite where we want it. And there were a couple of factors affecting that. As we said on the third quarter call, revenues are meaningfully affected by the S&P close at the end of the year. You know that better than anyone. And the 9\/30 S&P close was pretty depressed. That is used as the basis for setting Asset Management fees for the quarter. I think the good news, as we're sitting here today, is the S&P close at the end of the fourth quarter as of 12\/31 was 11% higher than it was at the end of the third quarter. But that was a headwind for the fourth quarter. The other thing was there was a lighter equity issuance calendar. And again, that's market-related, and hopefully, we see some more activity coming out of that new equity pipeline, which does remain strong. The other factors, though, that were fourth quarter-specific affecting, in particular, the comp expense. One, we've been taking out -- reducing headcount of the lower performers. And so we had some severance costs in there. The other is that productivity of financial advisors has been increasing. And at higher productivity levels, they're entitled to a higher comp. And this year, that was a fourth quarter true-up. Last year, it was a fourth quarter true-down. And then the other factor I noted is market appreciation from the deferred compensation program, that's those that are invested in funds, generally flows through the revenue line and the comp expense line, so it becomes 0 margin revenue. And it was really a number of different factors. But you're right, and the focus of the team is very much focusing on expense across the board so that we can continue to drive the margin higher.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have one final question, which is just on the Investment Banking and trading opportunities that you might be seeing emerging from the problems that some of your European competitors are seeing and their need to shrink balance sheets maybe faster than some of the U.S. firms. Are you seeing significant revenue opportunity starting to develop there?","Ruth Porat","Well, we are focused on it across industries, given the strength of our banking franchise globally but in particular in Europe. So on the financial institutions side, the expectation is there will be more opportunities to help clients raise capital and restructure balance sheets. But I think the other factor to consider is it's not just within the state client base. It's really more broadly across industries. As we look at in 2008, European banks took share from U.S. banks. And that's obviously when this country was going through its capital rates focus and liquidity raise. And given that European banks are now going through similar issues, our view is that, that creates an even broader set of opportunities beyond just, say, again given the strength of our franchise, we do see this as an opportunity to gain share. On the sales and trading side, we're well positioned and hope to built off of the momentum that you've seen in some of the numbers through this year. And then on the balance sheet side, I think that, again going back to James' comments about the strength of our partnership with MUFG, it just further strengthens our ability to help clients in Europe as well.","James P. Gorman","And I think, Guy, as you -- in any industry restructuring, as the players between sort of 10 to 20 range exit, clearly that share is going to flow to those at the top. And a lot of our businesses were ranked 1, 2 or 3 in the key businesses we're in. So I think there's probably a little bit of a short-term impact, but I do think there's a longer-term change in industry structure that should play to our advantage.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And is there any sign that some of those changes might be starting to improve market-making spreads pricing?","Ruth Porat","We haven't seen it yet.","Operator","The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Two quick follow-ups on FICC and equities. First, in FICC in general, whether or not you want to include the CVA changes. If you back out DVA, CVA, MBIA, is the right starting point for the quarter for FICC on a clean basis, going forward, $600-ish million?","Ruth Porat","I'll let you judge how you want to look at it.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Excellent. I can read that. In equities, Ruth, your comments were very clear that cash and electronic was a better driver in the quarter, and PB and derivs sequentially were lower. I mean, something's going really right in cash and electronic. And I just don't know if you have any more you can tell us. Is it what you and James both just alluded to in Europe? Or is this just constant progress and getting a greater share of client wallet? Of course, it's a significant outperformance if it's cash and electronic.","Ruth Porat","It is real outperformance relative to the market volumes that we saw. With market volumes down, there was strength there. I would say that the strength of the team across products continues to be a real driver for the performance in the business. And you see it year-over-year, when you look at the sequential improvement, the strength that we had in derivatives goes back to a lot of the comments we've had on prior calls, which is that the team has been focused on really building adjacencies across its business, ensuring that we've built up what we did on the derivative side. You go back 2 years ago when we said we were going to build up equity derivatives. We had 3 sequential strong quarters there. And so it's really across products working together as well as they do and around the globe. So the benefit of the electronic platform is there's still delivery to clients, electronic invoice. It's working well, and it's really enabling us to stay as well connected to clients as possible.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Sounds like you feel it's sustainable as well. I appreciate that you are the only person I cover that actually expanded the European exposure disclosure. But what's the net-net? Meaning, I don't know if I heard the, \"We feel very comfortable, we think their exposures are collateralized.\" And what's your net-net feeling on your Euro exposures?","Ruth Porat","We do feel -- I think you've summed it up well. We feel very comfortable with our exposures. We think that continuing to provide the transparency is helpful. And so we've expanded the disclosure this quarter, but we feel very comfortable with our exposures. We've got a strong business in Europe, and we remain present. But we like the way we've managed over the last several years here.","James P. Gorman","And I would say, Glenn, we were never quite in the camp of the hysteria that surrounded us last October about our European exposures. We're a little bewildered by it, to be honest, which led us to a very fulsome disclosure in the appendix last quarter, and it's been netted to with the unfunded commitments this quarter. And frankly, the position has been improved by reducing one of the larger concentrated positions.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then lastly, is the overhang in Europe and uncertainty there, is that the major impetus to remove a cloud to get to a higher earnings level? I appreciate all the progress made, but I'm sure people are still looking for more in '12.","Ruth Porat","That is the primary overhang. This year -- the past year, 2011, has the dual complexity of all of the drama around the debt crisis and the downgrade for the U.S. But as James said, I think there are more signs of progress so far in the U.S., and that the ongoing uncertainty in the Eurozone continues to be a big cloud. There clearly also is some of the question marks around regulatory uncertainty. But if you were to rank them, I think the Eurozone and therefore, the issues that are holding back some clients from executing on transactions is a problem.","Operator","The next question will come from Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, first, just -- you talked about some of the sort of resizing that you've done. And I guess, I'm curious. How much sort of the forward-looking -- and you said, too. You've kind of identified businesses you want to be in. But how confident are you around where the outstanding regulatory questions, rules around derivatives, Volcker, are going to land such that, that may still be subject to substantial revision going forward? Or do you think you kind of have a pretty good sense of positioning at this point?","James P. Gorman","Well, I think, as we've said for a while, the most important regulatory change are the capital requirements coming out of Basel III. And I think we have a reasonably good handle on where that is likely to end. The whole Volcker, Dodd-Frank discussions are obviously still very much ongoing, as witnessed by the hearings yesterday. And listen, we've obviously done an enormous amount of work internally quantifying the impact of different rule changes, what they would mean for our business and so on. Our base case is not an extreme shutting down of all market-making activity. And we think that the original concept of Volcker, which was to ensure that deposits were not used for highly liquid prop trading, should be honored, and then we'd move forward with that. So the regulatory front remains very much in dialogue. You've got governments around the world weighing in on the U.S. position to make sure that the various international bond markets aren't disproportionally affected. You've got inventory management by large institutions like ours to ensure that we can provide liquidity for our clients. So it remains fluid as you know it. But we run all sorts of scenarios against it.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Then separately, other sales and trading, I was wondering if could give us a little more color on what drove the delta there. You mentioned hedge gains on owned debt. Did you repurchase some of your own debt during the quarter? And if so, how much? And is that an ongoing activity?","Ruth Porat","Well, you got a couple of questions in there. So the other sales and trading line is, as we've talked about in the past, is pretty difficult to model. I appreciate because it has a number of items in it, and it has amortizing hedges from debt we bought back in '08, '09. It has our long-term debt hedging program. It has our bank liquidity portfolio, loan book, our deferred compensation plan. And so sometimes the items all move in one direction and sometimes they're offsetting, and so therein lies the complexity. We did buy back some of our debt over the quarter. It was a small amount, and so that really didn't explain it. It was really just the various across-the-board items.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, got it. Then lastly, do you -- similar to what Goldman talked about yesterday on the relationship lending, both the CD backstops [ph], is that a big business for you? Are you considering potentially moving to hold the maturity? And tied to that, more broadly, are there other issues like this that maybe we put in an active mitigation bucket, that when we look forward to Basel III, helps you to even grow these ratios higher than what the past roll forward [ph] points to?","Ruth Porat","So with respect to lending an HFI, fundamentally, we are a mark-to-market shop. I think as it relates to the loan book, we obviously have a bank. We're the 15th largest U.S. depository by deposits. And so we're always considering what make sense in terms of capital and funding efficiency. I think notably in CCAR, mark-to-market loans were penalized substantially more than HFI loans. And our view is it's our responsibility to consider what makes sense for shareholders. So that is one consideration. And then the other question I think you're asking is with respect to what other repositioning under Basel III. And I think we have, as I noted, continued to focus on 2 things really within Fixed Income. One is share gains, the other is return on capital. And part of the return on capital driver is really having a forward lens to Basel III requirements and ensuring that we are positioning our businesses to be as capital-efficient under this Basel III regime. And so there should be continued benefit from active mitigation as we continue to rightsize some of the portions of businesses that are most affected by Basel III.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Ruth, maybe, one follow-up on the expenses. So you guys have kind of the efficiency initiative over the next, I think, 2 more years on the $1.4 billion side. And then you have some of this restructuring. So I guess, just some update on what's going on maybe in the first, second quarter on the cost side, given some of the more recent moves versus any change on that longer-term efficiency project for the $1.4 billion.","Ruth Porat","So on the office of reengineering, we remain confident with that $1.4 billion, that's a target by 2014. And we're also very comfortable with the run rate target for this year, which is $500 million. The key focus areas are the same as the ones we've discussed previously, the highest ones being location strategy, procurement programs and tech spending. And so that's very much on track. But I'd underscore the non-compensation expense this quarter, which as I said, was down relative to last quarter. And that's notable because the fourth quarter is typically our sequential high. And it really underscores what we're doing at the tactical level. So if you put kind of the office of reengineering in this bucket, a bigger, more strategic, however you want to define it, cost-cutting that takes longer to do because we're repositioning the way we do certain elements of the business, and put that to the side. We also have a tactical initiative, and we're pleased with our noncomps because it shows that on even across-the-board small items, we've taken a really diligent approach to ensure that we're doing all that we can to control costs. And that also persists as we move into this new year.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then James, just on the Wealth Management business, so 2 things there. Just margins in the fourth quarter tend to be low, you guys mentioned, just given the seasonality of expenses and then given where markets were. As we head into this year and assuming rates don't change, like where do you think margins can get, assuming flat, slightly up markets? And then just in terms of the buy-in, based on what you guys have it marked and where Citi's got it marked, in terms of odds of getting that concluded or taking in that 14% stake, like if it's somewhere in between, like a middle ground, is that -- do you see enough value in that business to be purchasing it for some level of that's in that range?","James P. Gorman","Yes. I'll talk about the second question and Ruth can talk about where we're looking at the margins here. On the process, just recall it's a call option exercisable, I think, at May 31 or June 1. If the parties can't agree, we go to a third party, and it's at fair market value. I don't think there's going to be a whole lot of mystery, frankly, irrespective of whatever institution has it marked at is kind of irrelevant. It's a question of what is fair market value. And we're both mature, grown-up institutions, so I think we'll quickly figure out our fair market value. And if we can't, then we'll obviously go to a third party. So it's not a traditional M&A-type transaction in that the prices are already determined which is market value. So I'm not particularly focused on that element of it. And as we said earlier, if you look at the strategic rationale for this business, it's part of our long-term plan, and we obviously count the goodwill against that capital already in it. So the incremental cost, if you will, of doing this against the benefit is relatively small to say the least. ","Ruth, I don't know if we have anything more to add on fourth quarter and where we're looking at this year?","Ruth Porat","Yes. And the only other thing to add, this is our call option. So similarly, our call option on whether it goes to arbitration. But with respect to margins, we're continuing to focus on the mid-teen margin target, and the levers that we've talked about remain very much the ones that Greg and his team continue to be focused on. So on the cost side, the lower integration expense having cracked the back on the major expenditures with the technology platform done in the third quarter of last year. But also given the environment, the team has raised the bar in expense management. And then similarly on the revenue side, a real focus on continuing growth of the managed account platform, as I mentioned, the ongoing growth in lending and a couple of other issues. And to be clear, that's not mid -- That's not 2012 guidance, that's kind of our mid-next year guidance.","Operator","The next question will come from Fiona Swaffield with Royal Bank of Canada.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just had a question on the risk-weighted assets under Basel I. I think you said $316 billion. Could you take us through kind of some quantification of the moving parts? And then I also think that you mentioned sub-investment-grade securitizations, having done some work on reducing. Would that then mean that the Basel III -- is that part of the $100 billion rolloffs? Or does that mean that the $480 billion, which I think will obviously has gone down post the MBIA, to maybe $430 billion, if you could confirm that? Does that mean that, that number could be coming down a bit? I wonder if you could help us on that.","Ruth Porat","So on Basel I, why the risk-weighted asset is lower there? They're lower in part as I noted because of MBIA and also the balance sheet's lower. And so our risk-weighted assets came down in line with where the balance sheet is. With respect to Basel III, what we're really focused on, given there have been a number of changes affecting -- in guidance affecting both numerator and denominator over the last 1.5 years, when we initially gave out guidance on RWA inflation and mitigation. And Basel 2.5 has moved from an NPR to 2.5, is kind of moving around. So as a result, what we thought is the most effective and useful is to give you where we are in Tier 1 common ratio. And our Tier 1 common under Basel III, we're comfortable that it's approaching 10% by year-end 2012. In the numerator, we are deducting the MSSB NCI and adding consensus earnings. And in denominator, you have RWA inflation and passive mitigation from here through the end of 2012. We'll continue to be focused on active mitigation, to your question. And so that remains incremental upside of any active mitigation, but focused on the overall ratio here.","Operator","The next question will come from Daniel Harris with Goldman Sachs.","Daniel F. Harris - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if we can continue to focus on Global Wealth here for a second. So you mentioned that by the middle part of the year, the integration should be largely complete on the technology side. What happens then at that point with regards to the number of offices you have? And how do we think about that, assuming all else equal, with regards to your ability to take out non-compensation?","Ruth Porat","The offices -- we are continuing to look at where there are efficiencies in combining offices. Sometimes there are, sometimes there aren't because you have fully staffed active offices potentially within a similar area. So you can assume that across the board, we're continuing to look at where it makes sense to further consolidate or take or cut costs. And the team is being quite detailed about that. With respect to the technology spend and integration-related cost, the integration expense does come down. There is some software capitalization that then comes in, so you can't assume it's a cliff that drops off to 0. But it's come down meaningfully, and that's the real point there. And so we've hit the high point and it's rolling off. There are ongoing expenses that hit the P&L, and then the other expenses that the team can focus on include everything that you can imagine, all the details within the P&L, to do whatever we can to drive margin.","Daniel F. Harris - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And so the integration costs this quarter were roughly $70 million or so and you expect that, that should trend down a little but not get to 0?","Ruth Porat","The point is the integration expense comes down to 0. But I just wanted to make it clear that from a margin impact that there are offsets to that, namely I think, the one most relevant is software capitalization. And there's some other items that continue to flow through the P&L once we're steady-state.","Daniel F. Harris - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly on for me -- so thanks for the color earlier on into the very early 2 weeks of the year here. Obviously, a lot of us track activity levels, and they certainly seem weaker. But I wanted to focus in on one area that's more difficult, and that's credit. I think that, that's the one area where we look at that we can actually see some good results, if you're thinking about credit tightening and structured credit trading. Is that an area that's been something that's been better than we saw in the fourth quarter, which was down -- better in the first quarter that was down last year?","Ruth Porat","Well, again, it's very early, too early to say. I think that the marks that we -- the pain in credit in the third quarter was acute. And as I noted, it was modestly -- it was better this quarter but still not running at levels that are consistent with historic levels for that business. We have a very strong credit business broadly. And so there is upside as credit markets continue to heal. But I would say that, given that the major overhang, as both James and I said, is the Eurozone crisis and\/or uncertainty in the Eurozone, it's too early to make a call on that.","Celeste Brown","And with that, we look forward to speaking to you on our first quarter call. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During today\u2019s presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James Gorman","Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I will keep my remarks brief today when describing the quarter\u2019s performance as results are relatively straight forward. This is the second quarter, the firm generated revenues in excess of $10 billion. We achieved the return on equity of 13% and a return on tangible equity of approximately 15%. Institutional securities continued to demonstrate leadership in areas of traditional strength. Investment banking and equities reported very strong results and fixed income continued to perform well.","Wealth management remained solid. The segment generated a pre-tax margin of approximately 27%, while continuing to invest in the business. Our technological capabilities have evolved from an exploratory phase in the tangible tools that aim to enhance FA productivity, streamline operations and support further asset growth. Investment management attracted long-term inflows for the sixth consecutive quarter. Additionally, we successfully integrated Mesa West over the quarter, complementing our unique platform of alternative and traditional products. John will walk through the financials in more detail shortly.","I would like to spend a bit of time on this year\u2019s CCAR results. 2018 was the eighth year of the CCAR stress test. Each year, the test has become increasingly more demanding and in fact has yielded results significantly more severe than what we and many other banks experienced during the 2008 global financial crisis.","There have been important reasons to increase the severity of the test over time, ensuring the safety and soundness of the large institutions and decreasing systemic risk of the U.S. financial system. At Morgan Stanley, capital as expressed by our CET-1 and total capital ratios is strong, both on absolute and relative basis.","Several institutions including Morgan Stanley were provided the option to hold capital distributions flat to 2017 or the average of 2016 and \u201817. We did just that, keeping aggregate distributions the same as in 2017 but we changed our mix slightly. We increased our dividend to $0.30 per quarter, reflecting our confidence in the stability of the firm, and lowered our buyback commensurately to accommodate the dividend.","We will not get ahead of our sales in predicting what the Fed will do next year, but 2018 appears to be a transition year. Going forward, we expect to be able to continue to invest in our business and offer our shareholders an attractive capital return while maintaining a prudent capital base.","Now, as we look forward, we fully expect the third quarter to experience the seasonality common to the summer months. But as we all know, the near-term landscape can change quickly. Whatever transpires this quarter, we remain confident in the medium term goals we laid out at the beginning of the year and are well on track with each of them.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jon.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you and good morning.","Second quarter results were strong. We reported revenues of $10.6 billion. Year-to-date revenues were $21.7 billion, a firm record after excluding the impact of DVA in prior periods. Second quarter diluted EPS was $1.30, ROE was 13%, and return on tangible common equity was 14.9%. Institutional securities displayed strength across the segment. Investment banking performed very well as new issue markets remained open and receptive to corporate strategic activity. Equity sales and trading was buoyed by active global markets and fixed income benefitted from strong client flow. We delivered solid results across wealth and investment management, our sources of more stable revenues.","Total non-interest expense was $7.5 billion in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our efficiency ratio was 70%, an almost 200 basis-point improvement compared to the same period last year. This improvement reflects operating leverage across both compensation and non-comp expenses. In addition to the impacts from revenue recognition accounting, increased expenses have primarily been driven by higher compensation and execution related costs associated with higher revenues. Discretionary spending has been well-controlled. And this discipline has allowed us to continue to make investments across the firm, especially in technology.","Now, to the businesses. Institutional securities generated revenues of $5.7 million in the second quarter. Continued strength across investment banking, equities and fixed income has contributed to year-to-date revenues of $11.8 billion, our strongest first half of the year excluding DVA since 2007 and a 19% increase versus the same period last year. Non-compensation expenses were $1.9 billion for the quarter, a 4% sequential increase, driven by higher professional services expenses. Compensation expenses were $2 billion, representing a compensation to net revenue ratio of 34.9.","In investment banking, all products and regions performed well, generating revenues of $1.7 billion. The results represented 12% increase versus the strong first quarter. Advisory revenues for the quarter were $618 million, up 8% sequentially. M&A volumes have continued at record levels, supported by larger strategic transaction and cross-border activity. Clients remain engaged and pipelines are healthy.","New issue market conditions remained favorable in the quarter with significant investor demand across both equity and fixed income, supporting strong underwriting results. Equity underwriting revenues of $541 million were up 29% sequentially as favorable backdrop allowed us to convert a strong IPO backlog and convertible activity also remained robust. Clients in Asia continue to be active including a number of larger IPOs in the quarter.","Fixed income underwriting results increased 4% sequentially to $540 million with stable results across both high-yield and investment grade issuance. Whereas the effects of U.S. tax reform and rising rates have weighed on investment grade flow issuance, this has been more than offset by increased strategic financings. We believe this benefits our franchise which is more oriented towards non-commoditized debt products and activity.","Investment banking pipelines remained constructive across products and regions. Both, advisory and underwriting revenues should benefit from the elevated level of strategic activity in the year so far. However, given the continued macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, we are watching markets for volatility that may slow future issuance.","In equities, we\u2019ve retained our leadership position and expect to be number one globally. Revenues were $2.5 billion with strong results across all regions, particularly Europe. Prime brokerage revenue saw sequential increase, aided by seasonal factors in Europe and stable client balances. Derivatives and cash revenues remained robust, although lower than in Q1 as market volatility and global volumes trended lower.","Fixed income continued to perform well with quarterly revenues of $1.4 billion. Each business lines saw sequential decline versus a very strong Q1, but divisional revenues were up 12% year-over-year. Seasonality and a decrease in rate volatility, particularly in the latter part of the quarter, contributed to the sequential decline. ","In our macro business, we saw strong client activity in FX. Rate was impacted by range-bound yields in the second half of the quarter.","Our credit businesses performed well as activity remained robust, despite widening credit spreads. Our institutional lending franchise also continues to grow as we provide financing across a wide range of asset classes globally.","In commodities, revenues were down due to a fewer structured transactions which can be episodic. Fixed income strength has been supported by deeper relationships and better client activity. The business continues to build on its gains and we are encouraged by its momentum. Average trading VAR for the period was $44 million, down from $46 million in the first quarter, driven principally by lower volatility.","Now, turning to wealth management. Revenues were $4.3 billion for the quarter as continued growth in asset management was offset by slowdown in transactional revenues. On a year-to-date basis, however, revenues of $8.7 million are up 6%. For the quarter, despite the slight revenue decrease, the segment\u2019s pre-tax profit remained at $1.2 billion. This resulted in a PBT margin of 26.8%, a new high, post JV. The business continues to demonstrate strong operating leverage. Year-to-date revenue growth has been twice the rate of expense growth and has translated into pre-tax profit growth of 14%. Both non-comp and comp expenses have contributed to this margin expansion.","Total client assets of $2.4 trillion is up 2% compared to last quarter. Net fee-based flows remained strong at $15 billion, contributing to record fee-based assets of $1.1 trillion or 45% of total client assets. Asset management revenues were $2.5 billion. Positive flows were partially offset by the first quarter\u2019s lower market levels. Net interest income was $1 billion for the quarter, down 2% sequentially, driven primarily by lower prepayment amortization gains.","Year-to-date NII of $2.1 billion represents a 5% increase. Higher NII year-to-date reflects continued growth in balances and higher yields, which has been partially offset by increase in funding costs as we continue to diversify our funding base. In the quarter, we initiated a redesign of our cash sweep program in an effort to simplify our larger client sweep options. The initial phases of redesign became effective at the end of the quarter, resulting in approximately $10 billion of incremental sweep deposits. This increase was partially offset by outflows in the quarter, primarily driven by tax season and continued market deployment. Additional changes scheduled to be implemented in the third quarter are expected to generate a similar amount of sweep deposits. Rates on these incremental balances will be in line with the current money fund sweeps. Whilst lending in the U.S. banks grew by 2% to $70 billion in the seasonally strong quarter as client choose their SBL lines to manage liquidity through the tax season, year-over-year, loans have grown approximately 8%.","Following a strong first quarter, retail engagement declined in the second quarter. A flatter yield curve has also shifted clients investing into shorter duration products at lower commission rates. Consequently, transactional revenues of $691 million were down 7%, sequentially. This quarter results demonstrate stability and health of our wealth business. Despite some headwinds faced by the segment this quarter, pre-tax profit remained near record levels. Fundamentals remained strong.","Our sources of annuitized revenues continue to grow with consistent fee-based flows and record balances for both fee-based assets and loans. Additionally, we believe our investments to create a modern client and FA experience supported by integrated digital capabilities will enhance growth and further operating leverage over time.","Investment management witnessed another solid quarter with a continuation of positive long-term flows. Revenues were $691 million, a 4% decline relative to last quarter. Asset management fees of $610 million were down 3% sequentially. Year-over-year, revenue has grown 13%, driven by continued strong investment performance and positive flows, particularly in our active fundamental equity and multi-asset strategies. Investment revenues were $55 million, down 29%, sequentially. Investment performance continues to be solid, but we did see volatilities in markets and FX and our Asia Pacific funds in particular.","Turning to the balance sheet. On a sequential basis, total spot assets of $876 billion were up $17 billion, driven by increases in liquidity. Our standardized RWAs are expected to remain relatively unchanged at $388 billion. Our Basel III standardized common equity Tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios are expected to increase to 15.8 and 6.4% respectively as we accredited capital in the quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $1.25 billion of common stock or approximately 24 million shares and our Board declared a $0.30 dividend per share, up from $0.25 per share.","Our tax rate in the second quarter was 20.6%, reflecting $88 million of intermittent net discrete tax benefits. For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be at the upper end of our 22 to 25% full year guidance. Our first half results have been strong with two consecutive quarters with revenues greater than $10 billion. All of our businesses are positioned for growth and to support our clients if activity levels remain high.","Near term, we are cognizant of the typical summer slowdown. And of course there are number of uncertainties that may impact investor sentiment. Trade tensions, political uncertainties across Europe and the potential for an inverted yield curve to name a few are factors that remain in play. However, as we have demonstrated before, as long as markets are opening and functioning and bouts of volatility do not give way to client inactivity, we feel confident that we will achieve our medium term targets.","With that, we will now open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is now open. ","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks very much. A question on debt capital markets. It\u2019s like the one area across both trading and banking that I feel like there is room for you to improve towards peers. You\u2019ve done so well in other things. Curious on how you think about the opportunities, given your relationships with the sponsors, and then, how that factors in from what you\u2019re willing to risk perspective?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. Listen, from an overall underwriting perspective, we\u2019re very happy with the results. As I mentioned earlier, there has been some pockets of activity that we\u2019re generally better suited for, but we\u2019re very comfortable with our overall positions, Glenn. And when we think about our risk profile and our business mix, we like the business that we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re very happy with the results.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. How about -- on the net issues income front and wealth management, I think down sequentially for two quarters. Balances are growing, loans are growing, clients are growing, rates are up. I wonder if we could talk towards the -- what you mentioned about diversifying your funding base, what exactly it is, how much of that is the CD promo that you guys did and then how much of the flat curve is having an impact?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. And there is a lot of moving pieces obviously and this is the wealth management segment. But year-to-date, as I mentioned, I think I mentioned net interest income is up 5%. So, good growth year-over-year, which I think is a better metric to look at. Clearly, quarter-over-quarter we saw a slight tick down, some of that is driven by the prepayments I mentioned. We\u2019ve seen good loan growth. Our average earning asset yields are up, as you said given our mix profile and the rate moves but that has been offset by the rising interest expense related to the diversification of the deposits. I would describe our sort of ALM position as sort of modestly asset sensitive at this point in the segment. So, growth is going to continue to come from balanced growth on the asset side. And we do expect to continue to grow NII in that sort of 4% to 5% range, which is where we\u2019ve been growing it year-to-date.","So, the diversification impact is really away from the sweep deposits that generally have a lower costs into savings and CDs. The proportion of CDs are now much higher percentage than what they were clearly a year ago. And that\u2019s really been the primary driver of the impact. I also mentioned the sweep redesign has also had an impact on the interest expense. So, there is a lot of different moving parts. But, I would say the growth is really going to come from balanced growth as opposed to rate movements going forward in this segment.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. I appreciate. Just one clarification, on the CDs. That\u2019s for money that comes in from people that bring in new money. Right? In another words, you\u2019re not chasing hot CD rates, you\u2019re providing high rates to people that bring more balances to their Morgan Stanley relationship?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, certainly in the wealth management channel, the new CD promotional rates and savings rates have been for new money, as you said and we\u2019ve seen really good uptick on that. What we\u2019ve generally seen, we haven\u2019t had a lot of those promotional periods for a while. So, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of activity yet. That\u2019s going to happen this summer. But, what we\u2019ve generally seen in some of the smaller programs that we\u2019ve run is that money is new money for the system that\u2019s come in. And it\u2019s generally been redeployed mostly back into their investment accounts in both fixed income and equity. So, it stays within the system. We do also raise CDs outside of the network externally. And we\u2019ve been raising those as well to continue to diversify the stability of the mix.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski, Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Guy Moszkowski","Thanks. Moszkowski, but I guess you guys know that.","Jonathan Pruzan","Good morning, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski","So, let me just follow up if I might on Glenn\u2019s question about the deposits. So, your deposits for the institution are up about $12 billion or so, linked quarter about 8%. We didn\u2019t see quite that much growth in lending. I think, lending and commitment -- the balance sheet lending commitments up about $8 billion, and so, really $4 billion on the balance sheet. You\u2019re talking about the seeps adding another $10 billion probably as you implement the next phase in 3Q. Just help us think a little bit from a very big picture point of view, how you\u2019re thinking about deploying deposit funding despite the fact that it\u2019s clearly getting more extensive?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. And again, I think you\u2019ve identified most of the pieces, but let\u2019s just step back for a second. So, if you look at the disclosure, the U.S. bank deposits are up about $13 billion. I would categorize them really in three buckets. One, you mentioned the diversification of the product offering really promotional CDs and savings as well as we continue to roll out new products. We\u2019re out testing a new every day cash management product right now in a few complexes. So, we continue to try to modify our product offerings. But that bucket, if you will, is up about $2 billion this quarter. The sweep deposits are also up about $2 billion. You mentioned we did sweep in -- that change caused the sweep in of about $9 billion or so. But we saw outflows, both going to tax payments and redeployment into the market, so that net impact is about 2. And then, the third channel, as I mentioned, is a wholesale source CDs. We actually were pretty active in that space this quarter. And that number is up about $9 billion. A couple of things there. As I mentioned, we do have a couple of big promotional rates CD offerings that we ran through the system last year rolling off. So, we want to get ahead of that as our expectation is a lot of that money, some will stay in deposits, but a lot of that will get reinvested into the market. And we wanted to be in advance of that. So, we had the appropriate amount of liquidity to continue to fund both the wealth channel and the ISG lending growth.","So, those three components make up to $13 billion, not all of that is wealth sourced and not all of that goes to support the wealth business. We see a continuation of clients making investment choices of how they want to deploy their cash. They had been putting it more into the longer term fixed income and equity markets cash relative percentage in the system. It\u2019s still at or near its all-time lows and percentage in equities is at or near its all time high. So, we\u2019re going to continue to see this trend of a diversification away from the sweet deposits, which are lowest cost funding source into some of these more higher cost products, and that\u2019s what really is going to drive interest expense going forward.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. That\u2019s helpful to have that breakdown of the different moving parts. Thank you for that. Changing the subject a little bit. James opened up with some comments on CCAR. And I was wondering, if you could help us summarize what your thinking is with respect to moving forward towards the stress capital buffer. How you\u2019re positioned, how are you thinking about that, and how it might interact with your ability to return capital?","James Gorman","I think it\u2019s a little premature, I mean, not to duck the question, Guy. But we\u2019re still on the comment period. This was obviously a challenging CCAR period where the stress test scenarios were extremely tough. And for the eighth year, they go sort of got tougher each year, but this year, they got really tough. And I think everybody\u2019s kind of taken a little pause on that and trying to figure out what is the right level of capital you need in the financial system to fund the economic growth and what\u2019s right leverage of the institutions. And I think, we have the comment period on ECB [ph] buffer where we\u2019re in that process now. From my perspective, the most important thing is the recognition that the capital that truly matters is risk weighted capital. Leverage ratios are important to sort of one instrument. But in terms of looking at what is actually on the balance sheet that you\u2019re levering that\u2019s much more important, you leverage treasuries or illiquid investments.","So, I think, as I said in the opening comment, we\u2019re in the transition period. I think we should let -- the Fed is going through this process. And I think we should respect the process. And we\u2019ll respond once we start seeing what the actual numbers are. The bottom line is where we\u2019re distributing I think that\u2019s $6.8 billion of capital through the first six months of this year, I believe we\u2019ve had earnings of $4.8 billion. Highly likely, we will have earnings about $6.8 billion this year. So, we continue to create excess capital under just this year\u2019s analysis. So, I don\u2019t expect us to be cutting our capital distribution program going forward and because frankly we\u2019re very well capitalized.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Devin Ryan","Hey. Good morning. I guess, first question here just on the retention loans and wealth management where I think the balance was $3.6 billion at last quarter. So, it seems like the last few quarters, we\u2019re seeing pretty flat financial advisor headcount. And I know you\u2019ve spoken about kind of external recruiting being more modest. And so, as we get closer to the Smith Barney retention piece rolling off next year, is the expectation still that the vast majority of that is going to drop to pre-tax? And then, when we think about the non-Smith Barney piece, which is actually the majority, are we getting closer to a cliff where we\u2019ll start to maybe see that roll off at an accelerated pace. And I\u2019m just trying to kind of think about the moving part here because I know it\u2019s important to the kind of the forward margin story.","James Gorman","I\u2019ll try to think some of those. I\u2019m not sure I fully follow all the questions. But generally speaking, the retention notes amortize over a long period of time, seven or eight years. Typically, the cliff event in January of \u201819 from Smith Barney clearly gives us optionality that continue to invest in the franchise. But again, our expectation is that will allow us to improve the overall margin in the business. I would say the trend over the seven or eight years has been that recruiting -- not only is recruiting being going down but the size of retention packages have also been going down. So, this acceleration or deceleration of amortization expenses actually already have been happening over the last couple of years. And we will get to a period, although albeit over time that that number will become actually reasonably stable as we have slowed down the recruiting and the attrition has also slowed down. So again, I think we\u2019re sort of through the peak hiring or the peak amortization periods in the old notes. We have this cliff event in January. And both of those things will be -- allow us real flexibility to continue to invest in the business as well as showing operating leverage.","Devin Ryan","Okay. That\u2019s great color. Thank you. And then, just a follow-up here just on the EMEA revenues, nice step up sequentially and year-over-year. And I know the equities in that region could be strong this quarter. But, maybe if you could give us a little bit more detail on what\u2019s driving that momentum. It sounds like it\u2019s across the business but just a little bit of more color there and just confluence of moving parts that you mentioned on trade retentions and Brexit. So, just level of bit more maybe detail on the outlook as well just by the businesses?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. And I think you mentioned it. The real strength in EMEA this quarter was both in our equities business where there is some seasonality as well as in our investment banking business. And quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, it\u2019s been good strength in those businesses. And I would say, if you look over a much longer period of time, it\u2019s probably from a depressed levels, but there has been good activity levels and good flows right now and it\u2019s really dominated around IBD and equities.","James Gorman","I think, to me, the important takeaway is this business is very global and we are extremely well positioned where it matters around the world. Our partnership in Japan is very positive. The franchise we have across Europe, and yes, we saw some sort of idiosyncratic moves to that this quarter but the franchise is very strong. Brazil, Mexico very strong, and obviously China -- Greater China, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia all very well represented. So, this was a moment when EMEA kind of popped a little bit, which was great, but Asia was less strong this quarter relative to the other regions. But again, the key is, we\u2019ve got capability in all these markets. And when the market is doing well, we\u2019re doing well in that market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is now open.","Brennan Hawken","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the recruiting question that Devin asked. Have you seen -- now, it\u2019s been probably a little over six months since you guys have exited broker protocol. And we\u2019ve seen FA headcount definitely be very, very stable. And you\u2019ve indicated in the past the desire to emphasize recruiting less. Have you seen any impact from that? Where is the market for FA recruiting at this point? Are you seeing competitors step up as far as competition for Morgan Stanley FAs? Any color on that will be great.","James Gorman","Why don\u2019t I talk about that, because I\u2019ve sort of watched this for about 25 years? The fundamental shift in this industry was the consolidation of firms. So, instead of recruiting in 10 different firms, in our case, Kidder, Hutton, Shearson, Lehman, Dean Witter, Reynolds, Robi Humphrey, Legg Mason, we now own all of those firms. So, you\u2019ve effectively absorbed your competitive -- the competitive group that would be recruiting in and out from all these firms in this kind of crazy weekly event that went on. And now there is basically 3.5, 4 big firms, and the amount of recruiting they\u2019re doing from each other is -- it\u2019s very small and it\u2019s small for good reason. We don\u2019t need to recruit a lot of people. We\u2019re growing organically; we\u2019re very comfortable with that. So, you\u2019re just seeing the whole space of the market now versus 10 years ago little and 20 and 30 years ago, it\u2019s just very, very different.","Now, that said, there is obviously the independent advisory channel where some people move to. There is always that prospect of somebody setting up a boutique on their own. But that\u2019s where the sort of power of the franchise, the quality of the research, the capability of technology, the extensive compliance, all of these things lead people to want to be part of an institution like ours. So, we\u2019re seeing honestly very little attrition. And as a result, we are doing very little recruiting. We like growing in-house. And we\u2019re doing that successfully. And clearly, it\u2019s economically a much better proposition.","Brennan Hawken","Sure, great. Thanks for that James. And in there you\u2019ve referenced some of the tech investments that you guys made. So, I wanted to transition for the follow-up and a non-comp grew sequentially this quarter, both in wealth and in ISG. Was there any noise in that line? I know, we -- you guys had highlighted I believe BC&E last quarter. Volumes were lower, but maybe there was some incremental tech invest. How should we think about that line as we\u2019re jumping off points from here?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. Listen, Brennan, I think quarter-over-quarter comparisons have some seasonality. There is marketing and business development. You highlighted BC&E, which is generally more skewed to equity. So it\u2019s sort of as equity trading volumes are up and down, as a result you\u2019ll see some up and down. But I think the right way to think about it is just more of a year-to-date. So, you can capture that six-month period. And as I mentioned in my comments, we\u2019ve been very controlled on discretionary spend. A lot of the increases, either rev-rec and\/or revenue related, i.e. higher rev, higher comp, higher sales and trading results, higher BC&E and transaction taxes. The one other area that you\u2019re seeing good growth is really, I guess from an SEC disclosure standpoint, the IP and T line, which is where you\u2019ll see some of the impact of our technology investments, where we continue to make those investments to improve technology, both outward facing and inward facing across the whole plan. And I think we\u2019re very comfortable with our 73% or below target or currently at 70, there\u2019s a numerator and a denominator effect in there. But we feel that we have good operating leverage and we\u2019ll be able to make the investments required to stay competitive and to grow.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Mike Mayo","I\u2019ll state my premise and you can review it, I guess. But I would say, today\u2019s results are result of what I would call repositioning 1.0. You restructured FICC and that\u2019s coming through. You had Smith Barney. You have the fee-based assets and the high margin equities benefit from the strength of balance sheet. Today\u2019s results are result of what you\u2019ve done for last several years. And that\u2019s I\u2019ll call it repositioning 1.0. My question is, do you need a repositioning 2.0 and it might seem ironic since results are among the best they\u2019ve been since you\u2019ve been CEO, James. But looking at what you\u2019re doing now, it\u2019s kind of playing out the game plan that you set forth. But now, a lot of your peers are doing all sorts of more aggressive strategic changes, whether it\u2019s national digital backings or artificial intelligence, or a lot more branches or your competitor has a new CEO. So, it seems like the pace of strategic change at your competitors is now interestingly faster than the pace of your strategic change.","So, that\u2019s my premise. So, you can either agree or disagree. But I guess really the question is, when you look out over the next several years, what are the areas of greatest strategic change? And I get your tech expo, which we appreciated you having that, maybe that\u2019s the sign of where you\u2019re headed.","James Gorman","Mike, there\u2019s a lot in that question. It\u2019s a fair question. I think just pick apart a little bit a few of the layers. I think describing it as sort of 1.0 is not really accurate. I mean, we probably made more strategic change to this institution the last five or eight years than we made in the previous 80. We had a wealth management business in 2006 that had revenues of $5 billion and pre-tax profits of $300 million; it currently has revenues of I don\u2019t know $17 billion to $18 billion and pre-tax profits of $4 billion to $4.5 billion. So that\u2019s not a modest shift. We had a massive physical commodities businesses, we don\u2019t own; we had MSCI, we don\u2019t own; we had Discover card, we don\u2019t own; on and on and on.","We have risk weighted assets in fixed income of I think $380 billion; we had a balance sheet of $1.2 trillion; we had capital of $30 billion. I mean, on every measure, this is a very, very different profile firm. And our revenues are high. We\u2019ve just had two consecutive $10 billion revenue quarters; we haven\u2019t had one in the previous 320 quarters. And we\u2019re hitting goals we laid out.","So that to me is a lot of strategic change in a very short period of time for a company of this size and complexity. I think, it is unwise to run strategy through envy. Every other institution has to do what they do based upon their own capabilities, their own DNA, their own particular challenges. I think, it\u2019s also -- I never presume just because somebody announces the strategy is going to work or it\u2019s actually going to matter. I mean what matters is things that create material change to institutions, and doing that to regulated banks of 40 billion in revenue size is hard. And our job is to make sure that we don\u2019t feel compelled to act simply because we read the newspapers about stuff. But we feel compelled direct because we see opportunities, which we can prosecute and believe we can deliver great bottom line too. As to where we\u2019re making changes, obviously, the investment in technology and thank you for the comment about the tech expo the folks did is real. That\u2019s not trivial; that is a real evolution within both, wealth management, the trading businesses that we\u2019re very focused on.","The potential for growing revenues in asset management given the diversification of the base, the range of products and the alternative space and the traditional space and the performance of that business is real. The share gains that we\u2019re seeing across banking, equities and fixed income is real that\u2019s happened last year, and it\u2019s happening again this year. All of those things are real, and the bank and what we\u2019re doing with the deposit strategy and also respecting the questions that came earlier around net interest income, the bank will remain a very important source of growth over many years; and then, our geographic repositioning, particularly in Asia where we\u2019re investing stronger than we need to for example in the U.S. So, a huge amount going on. We mightn\u2019t be making a lot of announcements about it, which is fine. I care about results. And a huge amount going on still within this institution. So, I don\u2019t know if that answers your question. But, our job, as I\u2019ve said to one of our team recently, and that said, what\u2019s our strategy? I said, what about make some money. Our job is to deliver for our shareholders and not to try and mimic what others do. We do what we think is right for Morgan Stanley.","Mike Mayo","That\u2019s helpful. So, if you had 80 years of change in the last eight years, I guess my follow up is your appetite for deals, your appetite to more aggressively reallocate capital to fewer areas, I think you\u2019ve kind of answered that but -- or maybe tax spend, are you looking to ramp up, how much you spend on that?","James Gorman","We\u2019re definitely increasing our tech spend across digital, automation; we just hired a new Head of AI, the cyber spend we\u2019re doing. So that\u2019s kind of a given. You can\u2019t be in the space and not be frankly investing in technology with the pace of change. On deals, I mean we did the Mesa West deal. We love to do things that we are confident we can absorb. I believe in being very aggressive when you see an opportunity that is right in your wheelhouse and being very cautious when you see things that our extensions into new space. And that will be our philosophy on deal making. But, I think for any of the big banks to engage on large scale transactions is probably a premature is my guess at this point. But small scale things that make sense, of course, we\u2019ll do them all day long. But the most important thing is we just see a lot of growth across our businesses and a lot of our opportunity for share gain, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is now open.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning. Can you guys give us some color? You had some really good loan growth in the institutional securities bank data on slide 12. Corporate loans are up about 36%, year-over-year. Can you share with us -- I\u2019m sorry 48% year-over-year. Can you share with us you know where that growth is coming from? How much is leverage loans? And also, can you talk about underwriting standards? Are they getting more conservative, less conservative in that leverage loan business please?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. I\u2019m just flipping to page 12 here to see the numbers. So, again, we\u2019ve had good growth in the ISG segment, as I said. That\u2019s a couple of different products in our FID secured businesses where we\u2019re lending loan-on-loan secured by different asset classes around the world. We\u2019ve seen growth in that business. You see that in the corporate loan line. Corporate lending is generally a relationship in the bank we\u2019ve seen particularly on the commitment side, continued growth in that area. And again, that will be -- you won\u2019t necessarily see big changes quarter-over-quarter. But broadly speaking in the ISG business, we\u2019ve seen good, attractive investment and growth opportunities. Virtually, all of that -- not virtually, all of that is secured lending. It\u2019s all variable rates. So, there is good ALM profile to that. And we\u2019re happy with the credit profile and we\u2019ll continue to grow that business.","Specifically around even, a lot of activity this quarter. Little bit more skewed to LBO activity, but basically our backlog or our pipeline is generally on a percentage basis more skewed to larger strategic investment grade deals. But, there has been some more activity on the LBO front pipes, still very good velocity in terms of our ability to distribute and syndicate. We have seen a little bit of repricing in the risk base, particularly in the high-yield, more so in leverage loans. But again, liquidity is deep. The CLO markets are healthy. So, we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity levels. Yields going forward have been repriced for the new risk metrics, if you will. And the deals that are in the pipeline are getting done, and they\u2019re getting done efficiency within our flex. So, we still feel very good about that.","I would say, the market seems a little bit more selective. And good deals are still getting done well, but we have seen some other deals struggle a little bit, not necessarily in our portfolio. And then, to the last comment, we have not changed our underwriting standards. We are still very-disciplined in that space and we will continue to be so, going forward.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. I appreciate it. And as a follow-up, I apologize if you\u2019ve already addressed this. Can you share with us, just speaking the pipelines, your pipeline, the backlogs and ECM and DCM and advisory, where do they stand in the second quarter versus how they were in the first quarter?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, I would describe, all of our pipelines that are three pipelines that you just highlighted as very healthy and constructive. And in the first six months, we\u2019ve been able to bring those deals to market, whether that be in the advisory space or in the underwriting space. And so, we feel very good about the pipelines. Uncertainty levels and volatility levels will impact our ability to do deals going forward. But we haven\u2019t really seen any major impact from any of the headlines year-to-date.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Your line is now open. ","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Maybe a smaller issue. But one of our analyses actually highlighted that yield on your securities portfolio was one of the lowest amongst the large cap banks. Is there any way for you to be able to take advantage of where -- at least where current market rates are and be able to either maybe extend duration or not even extend duration just current two bonds that create a little bit higher yield in that portfolio?","Jonathan Pruzan","I would say that we\u2019re very comfortable with our ALM position this quarter. We\u2019re little bit skewed more towards cash because some of the sweep redesigns brought in a lot of cash at the end of the period. But again, I think we\u2019re comfortable with our duration of our portfolio and the risk characteristics of it. If there are opportunities to incrementally get more yield in an appropriate and prudent way, we\u2019ll do that. But, it\u2019s not going to be a big area of growth and that\u2019s not where we try to generate excess returns.","Marty Mosby","And then, just, if you look at -- there was a recovery from prior charge-off, where is the location of that in the income statement?","Jonathan Pruzan","The location of that in the income statement would be in other revenues in ISG is where you would see it, which is obviously part of that that line item. But we did have a previously charged off energy loan, fully charged off that we were able to sell until we took a recovery, but we also took it through the negative or had a release of a negative provision line, so it dropped to the bottom-line.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Michael Carrier","Just a question on the wealth management business. So, you guys highlighted some of the technology investments that you\u2019ve been making in the past few years. Just wanted to give your sense, when that starts to come on line, like what you\u2019re seeing and like what are the goals in terms of bringing in new clients, new assets, improving efficiency over time. But over the next few years, is that is all kind of in place? What are goals from these investments?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. I would say that you sort of highlighted what our expectations are. We\u2019re going to see advancements in the technology help drive FA advice and time and efficiency and an ability to see clients\u2019 entire portfolio. So, our expectation is it will be useful tools to help our FAs work with their clients and potentially bring in some of the assets that they hold the way. We would expect also some efficiency on the back end. It\u2019s very early. And although we\u2019ve made significant investments and have that lot of technological change within the business, these trends are going to play out over a significant number of years. And we would expect to get good growth and good efficiency from them.","Michael Carrier","And then, just on the trading side. So, obviously, there\u2019s volatility in that business. But you guys\u2019 results over the past year or so, do you see more consistent in equities and in fixed than some of the peers. I just wanted to get your sense on either client traction, products. And then probably more importantly, just how you\u2019re thinking about managing risk, because it does seem more consistent than a lot of the peers in the industry?","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you for that. Again, I think we\u2019ve seen very good client traction, very good diversification among clients, so not a lot of concentrations. And this is across both equities and fixed income. We continue to invest in the footprint and relationship managers and we continue to see good productivity from them. So, we like the risk profile. You noticed our bar hasn\u2019t moved around very much. We feel very good about the risk profile of the business. And it\u2019s really driven based on our client relationships and client activity and clients flows.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe we can just circle back to the SCB and DFAST. I think obviously this year is not necessarily indicative of what happens next year and I get all that. But you guys have consistently had kind of one of the biggest volatility in the DFAST, from beginning to trough, yet it seems laid out, you made major changes to the franchise over 50% from wealth and asset management. Is there -- I guess, I\u2019m struggling with why is your volatility still high and is there anything you can do to kind of reduce the DFAST stress test volatility going forward? Any thoughts on how to handle that will be great. ","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. I mean, I think your observations are very similar to ours. First of all, these models were designed for an entire industry, not just for our business mix. So, I think there is some calibration to the business model, as well as risk sensitivity. One of the things that we\u2019ve been asking for is incremental transparency, so we can better understand the models because they do set our capital levels, but they\u2019re not the only input into how we thinking. And we clearly don\u2019t manage our risk based on Fed models; we manage our risk, based on our own models.","We do have a very large wealth management business in sales and trading practices which are sensitive to the securities and equities markets. So, just as a factual matter, the decline is driven by the equity path or a significant portion is driven by the equity path. As last year, as you know, it was down 65% market that stayed down and that will have an impact. But I think our expectation is that there will be some changes here coming forward. But as James said, we don\u2019t want to get ahead of it. We\u2019re encouraged by the comments around more tailored supervision. We do think that there are some elements of our business that might not be perfectly captured in the Fed models. And we\u2019re not alone here. I mean if you look at some of the results in the other banks, you have PPNR results that are multiple -- Fed models are multiples of what the banks get. So, this is not a Morgan Stanley issue. The test was designed for the entire industry and it served its purpose. It reestablished credibility and confidence in the financial system when there was none; it also recapitalized most of the banks. So it\u2019s been a great test. But we\u2019re looking forward and we don\u2019t want to get ahead of them but we are looking forward to some sort of sensible changes.","The only last comment I would make is, even though our trough -- peak to trough decline has been generally larger than most of our peers, we had been able to offer our clients -- or excuse me, our shareholders an attractive return profile. And we would expect to be able to do that in the future as well.","James Gorman","I guess, I would just add three things. Number one, I think Jon hit on something very important that the sort of equities profile of the wealth management business is suggestive that it\u2019s more volatile than our actual business is because of the scope scale we\u2019ve built in and the other sources of revenue. And that\u2019s kind of an adjustment that I think and hope will be more appreciated over time in the way the models are constructed under the stress test. If you just look at the stability of that business quarter-after-quarter, it\u2019s pretty evident that even in very difficult markets, remained stable. So that\u2019s number one.","Number two, as I said earlier, I think just taking a simplistic leverage ratio or supplemental leverage ratio and putting it at the same level as the core capital risk-weighted ratio, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. And I\u2019ve been public about that and obviously had discussions with the previous regime at the Fed about it and the current regime. And there is a lot of sympathy for taking a look at that.","And number three, I\u2019ve always found difficult to understand how you grow a balance sheet during a period of financial distress when assets are actually shrinking value. And the only way you really do it I think is through acquisition which clearly one wouldn\u2019t be doing in the time of financial crisis like this.","So, those three things are pretty important, meaty things that really matter, and we will see how all this plays out over the next year or so. I think, the Fed -- and to Jon\u2019s point, the stress tests have worked. The banks are better capitalized. The system is clearly safer. And 10 years on, it\u2019s time to take a fresh look at whether there are certain things that are in balance relative to other things. We don\u2019t want to be chasing the last crisis. We\u2019re trying to figure out the next one.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. Those are all fair points. Thanks. And just maybe a follow-up on the wealth management side. I think you guys have talked about mortgage as an important product to penetrate wealth management client base. But, if I look at year-over-year growth, it\u2019s definitely slowed. I think, it was 3% year-over-year. Is there -- what\u2019s issue driving that. Do you still see significant opportunity to increase that? Just any color will be great.","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. I think the couple of points. Yes, rising rates is one factor. But I think more importantly is that we had an outside vendor doing origination fulfillment prior. We actually built our own system and brought that in-house. And that transition period, we are now fully off of the old provider. And we are now fully on all applications, are going through our new system. We\u2019ve liked that for a variety of reasons. One, we controlled customer experience, which is critical to us. We\u2019ve seen better customer scores and shorter churn times. So, I think that that change is going to be net positive. But as we transitioned from the old platform to the new platform, we obviously were very sensitive to the customer experience and effectively slowed down that business. We now have the rate movements, but we do expect to get more growth going forward. And we do still think that there is opportunities within our existing client base for that product.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Christian Bolu","Good morning, guys. Just particularly on the sweep changes that you\u2019ve made to the deposit program. So, I guess $20 billion, 10 from this quarter -- 10 from last quarter and 10 going forward. Is that it or is there more that you think you can generate after that?","James Gorman","Well, again, from the redesign itself, that will be it. We\u2019ve raised -- and again, this is for a very small segment of our client base. It\u2019s the larger cash balances usually get swept at the $2 million level and now at a $20 million level. So, from the sweep redesign change, the August slug will be the last of it.","Christian Bolu","Okay, perfect. And then, just circling back on your comments. I think, you said something like wealth management NII growth, you expected 4% to 5% kind of yearly growth. Is that a fair way to think about 2019?","James Gorman","I was really referencing 2018. I think it\u2019s little early to get to 2019.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your line is now open.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Great. Thanks. Yes. Just two quick questions. First on the deposit and the remixing and diversifying of the funding. You saw the long-term debt come down. Should we think anything at all about turning out on deposits as ability to take down debt even further or is just simply switching out debt for short term wholesale?","Jonathan Pruzan","I think it\u2019s more of the latter. I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable. We have shifted more to unsecured debt and more towards deposits. We like the durability and the cost profile of those two products, gives us a lot of stability. You saw our liquidity numbers were up and we are carrying excess liquidity, but we\u2019re comfortable with that position of -- give us more flexibility around future issuance. But, I think your characterization is appropriate.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And then, quickly on the capital ratios. You mentioned they were strong, you\u2019re comfortable with where they\u2019re at, and this is a transition year with the stress testing. But you\u2019re going to be accreting capital. So, is the right way to think about that you\u2019re going -- the capital ratios should be increasing over the year or irrespective of client activity? You have the ability to grow the balance sheet and keep the capital ratios flat for the year?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. I think, I mean, we have that flexibility. We will be accreting capital. And if there are opportunities to support clients and invest that capital into the business at a good return, we\u2019ll do that.","Operator","Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"14799":["Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call October 19, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Sharon Yeshaya - Head, IR","James Gorman - Chairman & CEO","Jonathan Pruzan - CFO","Analysts","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets","Michael Carrier - Bank of America","Andrew Lim - Societe Generale","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Sharon Yeshaya","Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations.","During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at www.morganstanley.com.","Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James Gorman","Thank you, Sharon. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. After a challenging end to 2015, and frankly difficult start to this year, Morgan Stanley is back on track and delivered solid results in the third quarter.","The major strategic goals we outlined are trending in the right direction. Wealth management's pre-tax margins hit the lower end of 23% to 25% range for next year. Fixed income is on course for an annualized quarterly revenue run rate of $1 billion per quarter and project streamlines progress is evidenced in 73.3% efficiency ratio this quarter. The 9% to 11% ROE target for next year remains our focus. Traditional businesses of strength namely equities and investment banking remain solid. Additionally, investment management rebounded from its underperformance a year ago but more progress needs to be made.","We're comfortable with our strategy in competitive positioning but by no means are we complacent. We have much more work to do.","On the business side, expense management program has to run its full course. Fixed income needs to evidence continued consistency and our wealth management business needs to adapt to ongoing changes such as DOL and digital innovation.","On the regulatory front, we need to successfully meet our obligations that include resubmitting our capital plan and addressing shortcomings in our recovery and resolution plan. Furthermore, we have to ensure we're prosecuting our business optimally given the proposed inclusion of the GSIB buffer into CCAR and any other regulatory changes.","The firm is well positioned to move past these challenges and then focus on growth opportunities.","Finally, we must remain extremely vigilant about our collective actions and constantly reaffirm Morgan Stanley's core values. Putting our clients first and doing the right thing essential to our culture. If we embrace these simple objectives every day of work and every time we face the decision, I'm confident that the inevitable outcomes of these efforts will be achieving our financial goals.","Needless to say, we can never control for all the vagaries of market and geopolitical uncertainty, but our job is remain nimble as circumstances warrant and mitigate risk when called upon. Our senior team is battle hardened, loyal, and highly motivated to succeed. I'm proud of the way they are leading our employees through these ever changing times and I have every confidence they will continue to do so.","I'll now ask Jon to discuss this specific quarter in much more detail.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you, James. Good morning. The third quarter results demonstrated progress against the strategic objectives we outlined earlier this year. While slower summer markets generally impacted client activity and volumes, our business mix generated solid results. For the quarter, we reported firm revenues of $8.9 billion unchanged versus the second quarter. PBT was $2.4 billion and EPS was $0.81 a sequential increase of 8%. The results yielded an 8.7% ROE.","Before discussing the businesses performance I want to touch briefly on the progress we have made on projects streamline. We remain on track to achieve our objective of reducing expenses by $1 billion by year-end 2017 on flat revenues. Year-to-date non-compensation expenses have decreased by approximately $800 million or 10% versus the same period last year. While some of that benefit is related to lower revenues, the vast majority of the 200 expense initiatives identified internally are yielding results and will continue to be carried out through year-end 2017.","We continue to leverage our global centers of excellence and have hired more than 650 employees in lower cost locations. The vast majority of these hires have been offset by a corresponding reduction in the headcount in our core locations. We are progressing towards our target of hiring 1,250 employees in our centers of excellence through 2017. We have begun to recognize savings from shutting down the two North American data centers and are on target to close the remaining two next year.","Further last year's restructuring of fixed income sales and trading continues to be a tailwind through the overall non-compensation expenses base. In addition to the meaningful divisional headcount reduction, we have also realized savings in operations and other support services.","In addition to support service efficiencies, our streamline targets were predicated on compensation savings and lower litigation spend. Year-to-date our ISG compensation to net revenue ratio was 36% compared to 38% over the same period last year, excluding DVA. Litigation expenses have also decreased year-over-year. Our targets continue to assume that we will not see any new outsized litigation expenses or penalties.","Our CCAR resubmission as well as potential future cost associated with Brexit, will serve as headwinds to streamline. The CCAR resubmission has demanded resources both people and money and will remain a medium-term expense.","Despite these cross turns we are on track to deliver the $1 billion reduction in expenses by year-end 2017.","Now to the businesses. Our institutional securities franchise performed well in the third quarter. We showed leadership in our businesses of traditional strength, equity sales and trading, advisory and IPOs while continuing to make progress in fixed income sales and trading. ISG net revenues were $4.6 billion essentially unchanged on a sequential basis. Non-compensation expenses were $1.5 billion for the quarter up slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis but down versus the prior year. Compensation expenses were $1.7 billion and year-to-date our ISG comp ratio was 36%.","We remain disciplined on compensation and are committed to our target ratio of less than or equal to 37%.","In investment banking we generated $1.1 billion in revenues in line with our 2Q results. Year-to-date we were number one globally in IPOs and number two in announced M&A, completed M&A, and equity and equity linked offerings. Pipelines are stable and markets are generally constructive but as one would expect the timing and pace of future deals will be a function of the market backdrop, issuer confidence, and investor appetite.","Advisory revenues for the quarter were $504 million up 1% versus 2Q '16. M&A announced volumes are running approximately 35% below last year's heightened levels as lingering uncertainty and increased regulatory scrutiny have weighed on activity. However the pipelines remain healthy and clients are engaged and interested in discussing strategic transactions.","Equity underwriting revenues were $236 million, down 11% versus 2Q. Debt underwriting revenues were $364 million, up 6% sequentially. Equity underwriting activity remains well below historical levels. We saw a slight pick-up in IPO activity toward the end of the quarter and we will have to see if that trend continues. In equities, we expect to be number one globally. Revenues were $1.9 billion representing our best third quarter in recent history with solid results across regions. Revenues were down 12% versus the strong second quarter impacted by a lack of specific macro events, a muted underwriting calendar, and light volumes that are traditionally seen over the summer months.","Third quarter results were driven by continued strength in derivatives as performance was aided by a number of meaningful corporate transactions underscoring the collaboration and cooperation across our investment bank.","Results were offset by a sequential decrease in cash revenues on lower volumes and lower prime brokerage revenues driven by seasonality.","Fixed income sales and trading had a solid quarter with revenues of $1.5 billion, up 14% versus the second quarter. A more constructive backdrop in the last two quarters resulted in an improved trading environment.","The benign credit environment with tightening spreads broadly and in Europe in particular following the Brexit vote yielded stronger sequential performance in corporate credit. SPG also benefited from a favorable credit environment and increased volumes in agency trading further benefited our micro businesses. In macro, we witnessed an increased level of client engagement in rates largely attributable to divergent expectations around central bank policy.","Fixed income RWAs were $124 billion and SLR exposure was $344 billion at September 30. Fixed income revenues year-to-date are $3.6 billion. We remain comfortable with our objective of maintaining the revenue footprint we had over the last few years. This restructuring is a multiyear process and we remain focused on supporting our clients and delivering results.","Other revenues were up versus the second quarter primarily driven by gains on our relationship and event held-for-sale loans as a result of an improved credit improvement.","Lastly, average trading VaR for the third quarter was $42 million down versus $46 million last quarter and $53 million last year. The de-risking of our balance sheet as we continue to adjust the composition of our inventory contributed to the reduction in VaR.","Wealth management performed very well and continued to provide stability in the third quarter. Net revenues were up 2% to $3.9 billion which is a record for the business. The PBT margin was 23%. Despite retail investors remaining cautious, we have good momentum in this business. Total client assets increased 3% sequentially to a new high of $2.1 trillion. Fee based assets increased 4% to $855 billion which is a new high both in absolute terms and as a percent of total client assets. The increase included $13.5 billion in asset flows. These trends position us well for 2017.","Asset management revenues increased 2% quarter-over-quarter reflecting positive flows and generally higher indices. Net interest income was up 7% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. The sequential increase was attributable to both loan growth and lower amortization driven by a slowdown in mortgage prepayment fees.","Bank lending balances were up approximately $3.5 billion quarter-over-quarter and a $11 billion year-over-year on track to meet our lending goals.","Transactional revenues of $791 million this quarter were largely unchanged from Q2 but down sequentially when excluding the impact of mark to market gains on our deferred compensation plans as client engagement remains subdued.","Total expenses were essentially flat on the quarter. Non-comp expense were down 3% reflecting continued execution of our expense initiatives, notwithstanding continued investment in our digital platforms and enhancements to our infrastructure to ensure compliance with DOL.","Investment management saw stable asset management fees and less volatility in the investments line. Total net revenues were $552 million, down 5% quarter-over-quarter. AUM grew to $417 billion due to market appreciation and positive flows primarily in our liquidity products as a result of money market reform.","Asset management fees for the quarter were $508 million essentially unchanged versus 2Q 2015.","Investment revenues in the quarter were $51 million essentially unchanged versus last quarter reflecting a more stable investing environment. Overall expenses were down slightly 2% quarter-over-quarter driven by lower non-compensation expenses.","We currently have approximately $2.3 billion of investments in and relationships with legacy covered funds subject to the Volcker Rule across the firm. While we expect to request additional extensions for the overwhelming majority of these investments, we continue to consider various alternatives to be in compliance with the rule, including sales, redemptions, and liquidations where the amounts we ultimately realize on these investments may be less than their current carrying values.","Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $814 billion on September 30, down from $829 billion on June 30. The spot decrease was primarily due to a redesign of our wealth management client suite -- excuse me client cash suite program in light of money market reform and a decrease in firm liquidity following Brexit.","Pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $368 billion essentially flat to the second quarter. Our pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio increased approximately 20 basis points to 15.9%. Our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was up approximately 10 basis points to 6.2%.","During the third quarter we repurchased $1.25 billion of common stock or approximately 41 million shares and our board declared $0.20 dividend per share. Our tax rate in the third quarter was 31.5% and going forward we continue to estimate a tax rate of 32%. We have good momentum in our business and have made demonstrable progress towards our 2017 9% to 11% ROE target. That said we have more work to do. We must continue to execute on the plan we laid out at the beginning of the year including the implementation of our bank strategy and focus on expense management.","We also continue to invest in our businesses through digital offerings, electronic trading capabilities, preparation for DOL, and additional regulatory conformance. We will continue to focus on the levers within our control and we feel confident that our ROE target is achievable.","Currently markets are constructive but both markets and investor sentiment will be impacted by some major events on the near-term horizon, including the upcoming U.S. election, the outcome of Fed policy action, and the Italian referendum to name a few. Closure around some of these risk events will be an important factor for investor conviction and corporate confidence.","With that, we will open up the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One I guess starting out on FIG, not really, really encouraging to see the solid back to back results here this quarter and last. Can you help us understand whether or not there may be might have been some changes to risk management that has gone along with the new leadership team and may be could you have any facts you can share behind it may be, inventory loss facts or something along those lines to support may be a higher base line results or at least less volatility?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure, I'll take a try. I think when we said out on this restructuring what we said is we wanted to have a credible and critically sized business that was relevant to our clients and supported adjacencies that exist within our ISG franchise, for example, leverage finance with our M&A business. We also said we wanted to maintain the revenue footprint while reducing the balance sheet, the capital, the expenses, and the headcount in this business. We're three quarters into it Brennan, we've generated $3.6 billion of revenue year-to-date so that put us on track to maintain our revenue footprint that we saw over the last couple years.","I think the success that we've had have has boosted confidence and the team continues to jell. But it is early. This is good results for the quarter but we need to do this over multiple years not multiple quarters. I think the leadership has started to jell and bring the sales and trading businesses together. Consolidating, as you said, the risk management and some of the infrastructure support behind that and we've seen some real learning's from that experience and I think that's been a positive from a results perspective. But this quarter also benefited from just a good backdrop particularly for our businesses around new credit and SPG line items, we saw tightening spreads, better environment in Europe on ECB buying, better distressed trading volumes, better volumes in SPG, so good backdrop and good performance against that.","Brennan Hawken","That's helpful, thanks Jon. Do you have -- can you give us a sense, is it possible to give a sense about how much you guys might guess the positive environment helped result this quarter; is that just too difficult to try to see that?","Jonathan Pruzan","Any question where you ask if you want me to guess, I'm going to have to say no. Thank you.","Brennan Hawken","All right. And then shifting gears on to the wealth management business, can you share any plans that you might have around Fiduciary rule compliance, a very large competitor of yours has confirmed their direction, which is to not use the deck and so curious about what gets into your approach there and whether or not, you see potentially divergent policies as the business opportunity here as we move forward?","James Gorman","What whether or not, I'll touch on that. Firstly the team is going to be coming out making some announcements over the next couple of weeks. So Brennan I would like to get ahead of them but I think it's fair to say our firm view is that optimizing choice for our clients given them the choice of how they deal with the firm, services to access, how they pay for those services, is critical to how we operate as a firm. At the same time obviously we're operating on whatever the regulatory constraints are. But the choice has been a fundamental sort of guiding like for the firm and that is unlikely to change.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. That's very clear, it's very clear, thanks James. And then I guess one more question I would have is on -- also on wealth management. We saw the deposits drop quarter-over-quarter and isn't it that 2Q is sort of a soft base to build off of given the taxes. So could you help us understand what drove the change in deposits this quarter versus last within wealth management; is there any shift happening there?","Jonathan Pruzan","From a fundamental perspective there is no real shift in sort of client behavior as I mentioned Brennan in our -- in my prepared remarks that we did change our client cash management suite program because of money market reform. We had clients that were in prime funds that we're going to go to a floating NAV and with the gates and so forth, we did make a change in sort of how we sweep deposits based on thresholds and client preference first into BDP and then into government funds, so that had a slight decrease overall but it did actually improve the liquidity of those deposits as uninsured went down and insured went up.","But the BDP number is relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, so we haven't really seen any major change in behavior and as I said before it's still pretty subdued in terms of the investor sentiment.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, terrific. Thanks for clarifying that, much appreciate it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Glenn Schorr","Thank you. Jon two quick follow-ups from some of the comments you made earlier. One I appreciate all the color you had on project streamline. I just want to make sure, did you or can you give us a number of what of the billion is in the current run rate or what's less? And then your comments around as we approach the July 2017 deadline on broker compliance, I appreciate the potential filing extension, but what is the size and type of funds that we're talking about I'm assuming it's some of the real estate funds that we built with Asia but such size and type of funds and are they above or below cost base right now? Thanks.","Jonathan Pruzan","I'm going to go back to the first question first which I now actually forgotten.","Glenn Schorr","Project streamline, what is in there?","Jonathan Pruzan","Streamline thank you. So again there are a couple of different components to it. I think it's what I would say is that we're going to -- we feel very confident about the $1 billion. We've shown good -- we've shown good progress on the controllable expenses around as I said. If you look not quarter-over-quarter but year-over-year around occupancy, around T&E around some of the professional services that $800 million I'm not going to go line by line there is some benefits from the fact that revenues are down a bit, but we feel confident that we're going to hit both or the $1 billion target which obviously includes compensation savings.","On Volcker its $2.3 billion which is why we highlighted that number there has been some confusion around it. And we have our intent is to file for extensions through the overwhelming majority of that. We have options for the other funds well as it relates to the July deadline.","And then to your question I mean obviously currently the funds are at NAV now. They are basically historically whether it be real estate or private equity but it's the mix of the businesses and asset classes that we have been in historically.","Glenn Schorr","I'll go appreciate that last follow-up or it's question may be James. RWA is down a lot it's like down 16%, you got 15.9% CET1. You had a great result in capital return but capitals buildings is this high class problem you have, I think you'd be at the high-end of your ROE target range now if you had a similar capital ratio to the peers and you're above 10 on a tangible so. Can you talk about how you address that in terms of just keep doing what you're doing try to get more out is the give and take but it's kind of capital.","James Gorman","Yes, it is. I mean Glenn we're you know this is not a trend, it's obviously a marathon we're trying to build a firm that's resilient forward times, we're trying to be ahead of whatever the regulatory requirements are. That has been as you and everybody else know is a moving piece. We have the GSIB buffer coming into play obviously there is going to be some netting against that, if I read the speeches right around the shape of the balance sheet growth and around whether one is told to buyback commitments for the nine quarters.","So we need to see the GSIB buffers. We took our buyback from zero to 500 to 1 billion to 2.5 billion to 3.5 billion in the last several years. We took our dividend from $0.05 to $0.10 to $0.15 to $0.20 a quarter. So pretty significant progress. But you're right; we have a high class problem. I mean, I was amused watching some of the pundits on TV the other day talking about ROE and how different is from pre-crisis and I was one the yellow, the screen yellow well that might have a little bit to do, with the capital being a little different pre-crisis.","We had $30 billion of capital pre-crisis; our ROEs would be comfortably above $0.20 now if we were operating the business like that, but clearly that would not be a good or appropriate operating model.","So we are approaching I think we were at or near the top of the large banks in terms of payout ratio. I can't remember exactly but I think it was in the high 80s or even 90% ratio. This year we're continuing to create at a pretty spotty numbers as you point out and but we've got somewhere to talk in between times. We've got a resubmission on CCAR; successful resubmission would dictate whether our current capital program remains intact. So that has all of our attention. And then the 2017 CCAR program is just around the corner in April I think the submission is. So if you got to have a problem in terms of returns in this business that might rather be because you got too much capital. That I would argue as our problem.","Achieving a 100% payout ratio is obviously a terrific position for us to target and that's what we're targeting and then we'll sort of take it from there. But this has been a multiyear restructuring, I don't think any bank has wanted to try and get ahead of the capital ratios given that all of the rules have not been fully baked in as Jon just said we're dealing with the Volcker dispositions that will happen and whatever extensions we get from June 2017 but obviously we got some dispositions going, we've got the GSIB buffer in action, the resolution plans are still working, working their way through, all the banks are resubmitting those, so there is a still a lot of moving parts.","Glenn Schorr","Fair enough. Thanks James.","James Gorman","As a shareholder, frankly I as a shareholder take comfort from the fact that we have the capital that we have.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open.","Mike Mayo","Hi. Another question on fixed income and I hope you can appreciate some concern about fixed income given the record over the last 10 to 15 years they were certainly much better than expected. To what degree are the fixed results are taking more risk, page six of the supplement shows VaR is down for rates in FX and commodities but up in the credit portfolio and to what degree are the better results in fixed result are taking shares say from European banks and if you can address prime brokerage too?","James Gorman","I may be just start on that Mike and I will let Jon get into it. But listen we're not and did not in the second quarter run any victory lap around fixed income. We said we're targeting a $1 billion a quarter on annualized basis. We said there will be volatility around that by the very notion, very aspect of the markets. We're obviously did much better than probably anybody thought this quarter and part of that is the functional mix of our fixed income business but a more credit dependent business.","But that said we have made real changes to this business. We did bring down the RWAs from $390 billion to about $125 billion now. We did take out 25% of the total headcount cost and people in December of last year and we're currently on track for the $1 billion run rate in fact a little above it but again we're not too focused on the quarter-to-quarter moves and I think the question underlying it is, the teams do something on the risk front which was sort of further standard deviations out from what we have typically been doing the last couple of years, I think the answer is clearly no.","And we can, Jon, will take you through some more details if it's more to add to it but this is the business which, as you know, and if you look at the street numbers, I think all of the banks surprised on the upside but it was a better macro environment, there was more volatility post-Brexit, there was more volatility around rates because of the Fed multiple talking voices of the Fed and the credit markets turned out.","So if you're in the fixed income business, you're going to have a better quarter, we're in -- we had a better quarter, what I am pleased about is we did it with 25% less people. Jon, do you want to add anything?","Jonathan Pruzan","Not now. I'll add Mike with other parts of I'm sorry -- with the other parts of the question that James didn't addresses it you like me to tackle.","Mike Mayo","Well at least, I guess the flip side is the market share gains, I mean to the extent that you have to potentially use your balance sheet more than some global banks that are restructuring, how much of that is a factor in FEC or trading or capital markets generally?","Jonathan Pruzan","Listen I think what we've generally said is that we feel very comfortable with our competitive position, you can see our ranking quarter-to-quarter share is sort of hard to look at because as James mentioned these businesses move around. But certainly over the medium to long-term, we have a very strong position, we've got a nice global footprint, we have got to defined strategy, I wouldn't say not all of our peers could probably say that, so I think over the medium to long-term, we think our competitive position will bode well for us.","Mike Mayo","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christian Bolu","Good morning. May be just a clarification of project streamline, just unclear you've done $800 million in expenses so far versus the $1 billion target, does that imply $200 million to grow by 2017 or am I wrong?","Jonathan Pruzan","There is a couple of things. One is the project streamline is a total expense number, so that would include comp and non-comp, the $800 million is a non-comp number that's number one.","Number two the premise around streamline was a $1 billion expenses assuming a flat revenue environment. But if you look at year-to-date although we've shown nice progress in the second and third quarter as you recall, the January and February market environment but also the first quarter was quite soft. So we're actually running year-to-date below our revenue from 2015 and so therefore the apples-to-apples comparison is a little more challenging. So I don't think you can do the math that you just did.","The one thing I will say is that we're confident even with the incremental CCAR and Brexit planning expenses that are probably in the budget at this point. We're confident that we will be able to get a $1 billion of expenses out of that total $27 billion expense line from last year in 2017.","Christian Bolu","Okay. Thanks for the clarification. And then just on sales practices, I'm wondering if you can comment on the Massachusetts securities officers, enforcement action around your sales practices, you have to change anything, does that impact any your kind of efforts to increase lending penetration.","Jonathan Pruzan","No it doesn't. We are not changing things we are -- we put out a public statement related to Massachusetts we're not going to comment on that. We run our business consistent with the base of doing everything we can to support our clients, we'll continue to do that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Guy Moszkowski","Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to have a couple of follow-up questions on equities and fixed. In equities, you had mid- single-digits revenue growth year-over-year and of the five global dealers reporting so far there is once again a big separation between the three firms that have sizable prime brokerage activities yourselves and the other two and the other players who have really fallen behind. Can you talk about that is this sort of a coincidence or can you see real evidence that because of the strength of that business may be ability to reprise or concentrate share of flows that you really -- you're really able to break out.","Jonathan Pruzan","I will try Guy listen we are number one in the world in this business. And I think we're seeing the benefit of being able to provide clients with value across the globe. As I mentioned the third quarter was our strongest in equity since the crisis. So we are seeing the benefit of being the number one in the world and I think you're going to see just like in many other financial services products the concentration of market share among the top players and that's what you're seeing in equity.","Guy Moszkowski","And in fixed, can you give us a sense or the degree to which may be a long side strong flow activity that you commented on that that revenue might have been supplemented by positive marks on legacy long-dated derivatives or other position?","Jonathan Pruzan","Listen Guy certainly some of our fixed income businesses we carry inventories in those businesses as particularly in our credit and SPG areas and tightening spreads around the world we benefit from that. But I can't -- I won't comment on the -- I think your derivatives but it was a good constructive backdrop for this business.","Guy Moszkowski","And just as a follow-up to a follow-up on that one those types of positions are they still absorbing meaningful amounts of capital driving the significant part of the RWA that that persists and when we get back to the whole idea of long-term capital return potential should we be looking over the next three to five years for a significant free up of capital from positions of that type that don't generally generate pretty much revenue.","Jonathan Pruzan","The way I would think about is we have a $125 billion of fixed RWAs today. We are not meaningfully above or above 2017 target which was $120 billion and our longer-term target. So we continue to move towards those goals. We're positioned to running off overtime as we've talked about given the liquidity we saw I made a comment that we have been working on our composition of our inventory. We saw opportunities to come out of some of the liquid positions. We've seen a trend towards our clients wanting to trade in more liquid products given their view of the world. So we're going to continue to manage that business, we're going to continue to run those down overtime, and I think we're pretty close to the ultimate targets in that on our balance sheet perspective as it is today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Devin Ryan","Hi, thanks good morning. On GWM may be bigger picture, it still seems disconnected from history here that retail engagements so as to do it against the backdrop where risk assets have performed well and municipal assets are growing. So I'm just wondering is there any data or anecdotes that you point to that would suggest that this isn't a secular change around your products or demographics?","Jonathan Pruzan","No, I think, listen there is just been a lot more headlines, there has a been lot more volatility, yes markets have been trading up over the course certainly at this quarter and we're seeing indices at reasonably high levels. But on the flip side transaction revenues have historically been driven by underwriting calendar, where we've seen a very slow 2016. I think the geopolitical risk and some of this political risk and some of these risks that are much harder for retail or actually any investor, the probability way can get their hands around and probably push people to the sidelines. I don't know if it's secular or cyclical at this point but certainly it's at very low level.","James Gorman","I think as having watched this business over two or three decades, I don't think I've seen transaction levels lower than this. And just supposed against that that the business had record revenues is a testament to the managed money side of it, the banking side of it, the deposit side of it, things that frankly 15 years ago really didn't exist to a highly dependent transaction activity. And the world has changed, investors have changed but we're sitting on $2.1 trillion of assets. And their behavior has changed whether the transaction stuff picks up; I don't know post the election, post the Fed moving it remains to be seen. My guess is over time it does, I feel just intuitively, it feels like a low but can it go low, I guess it could go low but probably there is a bias to moving up rather than moving down of the next couple of years that said more and more money is going to fee based accounts.","Devin Ryan","Got it, great. That's very helpful and then you guys have $27 billion debt maturing over the next 12 months. How should we think about the delta between those rates relative to the current market rates to try and get a sense of what is the magnitude of impact assuming you replace that?","Jonathan Pruzan","Well I think a little way back we said that we had a good funding tailwind as the maturing debt was much more expensive than what we're putting on. I think at this point that has run its course in terms of our new issuance is generally in line with what's been rolling off. So I think there is still some benefit of sort of annualization and things of that nature but we come to probably the end of material end sort of the funding arbitrage that was going on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Fiona Swaffield","Good morning. My question was about net interest income in wealth management. Could you talk more about margins and they do seem to be pretty strong in the third quarter. But if you adjust for the prepayment which I don't think you really knew how much that's impacted Q2, could you help us on the trends in margins in wealth management. Thank you.","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes at 23.2%, it's obviously at the low end of our range, what we saw in the second quarter if you recall in June, rates are coming down, so then prepayment fees were accelerating, so we had a negative impact from that. We had obviously the opposite this quarter as generally rates have been rising throughout the quarter, was not significant contributor to the margin, we feel good about the progress that we've made. And at the low-end of the range that is 23.1% -- excuse me 23.2%, you should also recognize some seasonality in this business in terms of the expenses in the fourth quarter but again as James said and I said in my prepared remarks given the flows in managed money given the lending progress that we've made, we feel good about the margins and sort of the progress that we've made here.","Fiona Swaffield","I'm trying to check on the net interest income margin specifically there is no funny that that's a good base from which to focus going forward is just so much higher as percentage of assets and it's been for a while?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes that's a good basis, there is going to be some -- some nominal volatility because of prepayment fees as our mortgage book grows but that's a good base.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. I guess either for Jon or James, just on the DOL, James you mentioned you are providing customers with options, just wanted to get your sense on how to manage that versus say like the legal side or the legal risk. And then I think in the past, you guys mentioned that you didn't expect any significant impact on revenue or expense meaning like the margin, so I just wanted to confirm that as we get more information and you guys continue to work on strategy.","James Gorman","Mike as I said, I think the team is going to be saying some here the next couple of weeks, so really to be fit, I don't want to get ahead of it, I will give you a lot of details. I don't think that giving clients choice heightens one legal exposure in fact it's -- that just seems a lower counterintuitive. So I'm not -- we run a large complicated business and we do it in full compliance with the regulatory rules and we try and optimize what's always in the best interest of the clients. So that's the basic principle.","Jonathan Pruzan","And Mike on the second half of your question obviously there were drafts to the DOL rule out last year so we were informed when we gave you the 23% to 25% margin target. What we said about this is that, we think this is going to be manageable both from our clients perspective and from a results perspective and we're going to work with our clients to make sure that we were providing compliant solutions.","Michael Carrier","Okay, got it and then just as a follow-up Jon, on the buyback, it looks like the pace is just ahead off, I guess what you did in the last CCAR universes, what you can do in this cycle. And so just wanted to get a sense on you have more flexibility in terms of frontloading it and then when I think about I think Glenn had the question on just where the capital ratios and the ROE, you James, having too much capital definitely in this environment is a good spot to be, when you look at the global firms. But on the other hand it does weigh on the ROE and on the multiple. So when you look at what you guys are doing strategically in terms of focusing on wealth management, you're taking down some of the risk on the balance sheet is that starting to resonate with the regulators and so did you have the potential to get that CET1 ratio back I guess around the industry average -- versus at these elevated levels?","Jonathan Pruzan","I think as it resonate as regulators, I mean you'll look at the track record. We've increased the dividend four years in a row; we've increased the buyback four or five years in a row. It's we operate in a world which has been an evolving world from a regulatory front and we try to stay ahead of it and I think we frankly have done that in terms of where our capital is and I'm not going to repeat what I said I think was related to Glenn or somebody on what our plans are but we try and optimize within the rules of what we've said at the same time be appropriately conservative until we see where are the rules flush out. We'll get a much better sense when the GSIB stuff is finally written down and then we will know pretty much where we stand.","James Gorman","And then on the first part of your question as you highlighted we did buyback a $1 billion in the quarter this in the third quarter we have a $3.5 billion authorization that we do have $2.25 billion less to do over the next three quarters.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Your line is open.","Andrew Lim","Hi, thanks good morning. Just a follow-up question on capital. Following Dan Tarullo's remarks on the distressed capital buffer, mostly you've got a very strong CET1 ratio but presumably you've also got a very high distressed capital buffer but your minimum requirements will be quite high. And I'm just making that implication there from the impact on your CET1 ratio under the 2016 CCAR process. So I'm just wondering what your thoughts are there as to what you think your SAP should be what your minimum capital requirements could be, I know the rules on classified yet and how you expect how close you'll get?","Jonathan Pruzan","Let me try to take a crack out at this. So I would say a couple of things one I think it's a little too early to start estimating at STVs and sort of impact. This is obviously going into effect in the 2018 CCAR. So for 2017 what James has said and what we said at the beginning of the year is that we were capital sufficient and we would like to try to return capital above the current levels that we have and we're going to continue to do that follow that strategy in '17. And then in '18 as the NPR becomes rule and we have a better sense of what the ins and outs and the takes are will be in a better position to tell you what we think the capital outlook looks like then.","The one point which is reasonably clear from Governor Tarullo speech is the integration of sort of stress testing into the baseline capital ratios in business as usual and that's a trend that we've seen for a while, so I think broadly speaking although there were some lack of some of the details the speech was sort of broadly in line with our expectations.","Andrew Lim","Right. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up question just with 2016 CCAR and the comments people have been making about the FIG business possibly you've got quite a big impact there on the 2016 CCAR versus the severity [indiscernible]. And I was just wondering, how you're trying to up with the bank over your business, why would that be the case especially given that you're relatively light on FIG versus some of the peers, is it the case that maybe that's a reflection of maybe higher risk that you might be having in FIG and the way you got them done?","Jonathan Pruzan","I'm not sure, I fully understand the question. I will say that I think of the large banks we were the only bank that had their stress losses go down year-over-year. I think that is reflection of the actions that we've been taking around the risk of the overall risk in our balance sheet. We continue to look at inventories and manage those businesses and try to shrink where we can I mentioned that in my comments. So again I'm not sure, I understand what you're driving at but I think we are and I think our absolute stress loss is relative to the other big banks were also below those levels. So I think we are starting to see the benefit of the risk reduction that we have taken and I think that will continue to persist.","Andrew Lim","Right but the absolute delta in your starting CET1 ratio and then where it alludes to under the severity adverse scenario and that's relatively quite large versus all the U.S. banks and I was just wondering well why you think that would be the case?","Jonathan Pruzan","No again I think the way I would look at it is, we have been able to increase our capital return quite dramatically over the last several years and our ratios in CCAR last year ended up higher than the year before. So I think there is recognition of the risk reduction and the transformation that we've taken both on the revenue and the risk side.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. Jon I'm sorry if I missed this but in the institutional securities, what drove the non-comp component up sequentially? It was up about 5% quarter-on-quarter.","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes I mean on a quarter-over-quarter basis it's going to bump around as I highlighted year-to-date for the firm non-comps are down dramatically. So to be honest if these things are not straight lines but we feel confident that we've got -- we've got good expense management in place.","Eric Wasserstrom","Got it. I mean I guess I was wondering if it was just a function of the business mix given that some of the market revenues have more volume related components.","Jonathan Pruzan","No I mean I think that was not really a driving force you do know we have a retail CCAR resubmission in 2000 excuse me in December of this year, so there was some incremental expenses that we didn't expect to have from that perspective. But again these things are going to bounce around quarter-over-quarter and we feel very good about the $1 billion target we set for next year.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great. And if I can just maybe follow-up on the capital question, as we think about the longer-term targets, can you just help us frame whether that target contemplates or what it contemplates, I guess is really the question in terms of capital levels like in other words like to getting to the high-end assume stable or lower levels or does it continue to reflect an expected amount of capital accretion?","Jonathan Pruzan","I'm sorry the high-end.","Eric Wasserstrom","So if you look at the 9% to 11% target, all right, what is the equity assumption underlying that relative to where we are today, is it continue to capital accretion and net income is just expanding ahead of that accretion or is it some expectation of reduction?","Jonathan Pruzan","Well again I think when we laid out the 9% to 11% for 2017 in the beginning of the year, we said we had sufficient capital and therefore we wanted to try to maintain that capital level. You've seen that we've accreted a bit because obviously the payout ratio is based off of net income and we do issue equity to our employees as part of compensation, so we are accruing a little bit of equity. It was predicated on that sort of general math that it would creep up but nothing dramatic. And what we said in January, which I think is actually even more consistent now with some of the comments around Governor Tarullo speech about actually implementing those changes in 2018 is that -- that's our current thinking for '16 and '17. And then we'll obviously analyze the new rules as far as '18 CCAR, see where the progress that we have made on the balance sheet in the fixed income restructuring and then make another assessment at that point.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. May be quick follow-up in the ROE targets the 9% to 11% next year you are sticking with this but as we look at the presentation from January you were sort of under the expectation that revenue growth would be 3% to 5% annually obviously year-to-date that -- we haven't hit those numbers. So what gives you the confidence or what's changed in terms of your ability to still hit the 9% to 11% is it just greater expense confidence how do we think about that in the context of clearly consensus with employing an ROE below 8% doesn't clearly believe you can get there?","Jonathan Pruzan","Listen, I think we've shown some really good progress against the goals as you do mention the revenues are down '16 versus '15 year-to-date. But the target was for 2017. We think we can continue to make more progress on the margin and wealth. As I mentioned some of the flows and where we are in terms of our assets under management and our lending progress helps position our business for '17 continued leadership in equities and IBD where we like our positions in our global footprint. So we'd like to continue to press our advantage there. And we have more streamline to go.","So first quarter very challenging but we put up 8.3% in the second, 8.7% in the third and we're a lot closer to that 9% to 11% we clearly need constructive markets but I think that's what our confidence is being driven by we're closer to that number and we still have some of the initiatives and slightly we expect to realize them in '17.","Jim Mitchell","Okay, that's fair and then may be on the capital size. I think CET1 clearly very strong but the SLR I guess is where if you look at your progress to-date, it's been not as rapid on the RWA side in fixed income is that what's driving the slower progress on the SLR and you still feel confident you can get to the targets?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, to the last question obviously the SLR is the just a bigger denominator and therefore the changes that we have been making accrue more slowly to that number. But at 6.2% relative to what the minimums are and what our expectation is on CCAR is a strong number as well.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference that does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"15105":["Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Q1 2013 Earnings Conference Call April 18, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","James P.

This is Celeste Mellet Brown, Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to our First Quarter Earnings Call. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements, which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The presentation may also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings at morganstanley.com for a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley. This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James P. Gorman","Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, everyone. We will review the progress we\u2019ve made towards the sixth comprehensive steps we laid out in January that will drive our return on equity and return on tangible equity, excluding DVA to greater than 10% and 12% respectively, assuming a flat revenue environment. We\u2019d like to update you on the progress we\u2019ve made towards each goal during this quarter and we remained committed to the targets as laid out.","First and the first point number one to acquire 100% of the Wealth Management joint venture. As hopefully you know during the first quarter we received a non-objection in the CCAR process to our request to use $400 million of our excess capital to buying the remaining 35% of the joint venture from Citi. We\u2019re now waiting further approval from the bid consistent with the process for the 14% purchase last year and we look forward to hearing from the Fed over the next several weeks or months.","Number two, to achieve Wealth Management goals through expense management and to exceed them through revenue growth. Due to better expense controls and a more robust revenue environment we were able to drive another 17% margin resulting Wealth Management in the first quarter, despite seasonally higher expenses.","In addition, our flows in the managed accounts were very strong at over $15 billion. Long-term we continue to believe this is an extremely attractive business for Morgan Stanley. There is continued upside to profitability driven by a constructive environment in expense controls that gradually shifts back into equities by our clients, continue migration of managed accounts from commission based accounts, and finally revenue and margin upside from earning a 100% of Wealth Management.","Point three, to significantly reduce risk weighted assets in fixed income and commodities. We made good progress with the fixed income risk-weighted asset reductions and in the quarter at $253 billion, down from $280 billion at the end of 2012 and slightly below our year-end target of $255 billion. Our progress was partially driven by passive mitigation with much of the decline driven by credit derivative contract expiries. Although we are pleased with that progress, we remain comfortable with our year-end target of $255 billion.","Point four was to drive expenses lower in 2013, 2014 and beyond. Non-compensation expenses continue to come down sequentially consistent with the progress we have made last year and the targets we outlined in January. In addition, our firm-wide NIC compensation ratios excluding DVA in severance well below our full-year 2012 ratios, while our total compensation dollars were also below those from year-ago. This largely reflects the significant headcount reduction we made over the past 12 months across that business.","Point number five, was to grow earnings through Morgan Stanley\u2019s specific opportunities. As we discussed when we reported the fourth quarter, we believe there is significant revenue upside and expense savings for both institutional securities and Wealth Management as we move closely along those businesses. Institutional securities and Wealth Management launch the joint venture in September 2012 to increase collaboration between the businesses and there are currently of 40 initiatives in various stages of execution. We are already seeing the benefits in the first quarter and expect additional upside over the next several years.","For example, prior to 2013 the firm had two separate groups focused on fixed income middle markets institutional clients. In January these groups were integrated under a uniform platform on leadership and are evidencing positive early results. Revenue generated on these accounts was up despite aggregate market volume declines for the particular products in the same period.","During the quarter, we continue to deploy our excess bank deposits more efficiently. Our mortgage lending was again higher and we made significant progress in regards to our PLE or Portfolio Lending Efforts, where we expect to drive the majority of our retail lending growth over the next several years.","On the Institutional side, we added two new initiatives to our bank suite platform in the first quarter, and we are in the early stages of execution for commercial real estate and warehouse lending. There remain significant opportunities from growing our bank. As we have previously discussed, our deposits will grow to approximately $140 billion after we acquire 100% of the Wealth Management joint venture. And we have a prudent disciplined strategy to deploy those deposits over the next three years.","Point number 6, so how does all this set up? Well, our 8% ROE and 9% ROT both excluding DVA or solid start to the year; we expect that these levels will improve driven by the steps I've updated you on. The consistency of our returns is as important as the absolute level of our returns and we have made progress in this regard as well, particularly over the last several quarters. In addition, we believe many of the regulatory headwinds face the industry are already reflected in our results such as the cost of subsidiarization and because our growth areas of those that are unlikely to be much impacted by further regulation, our path is clearer.","In closing, I'd like to briefly touch on that Japanese business before I turn the call back to Ruth. Its top of mind because of the trip I made to Tokyo last week to meet with our partners. I saw firsthand the impact of new monetary and fiscal policies on the markets there and the impact they're having on our business. Joint ventures with MUFG, Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities and Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities are uniquely positioned in Japan to take advantage of what is a macro resurgence due to the global client network and capabilities of Morgan Stanley and the domestic Japanese corporate and retail footprint of MUFG.","Combined, we have an unparalleled distribution in mediating invested capital flows into Japan and helping Japanese companies grow abroad. In Japan we have top three positions in equity and fixed income underwriting and M&A. As Japanese domestic firms consolidate their IBD market share, JV is differentiated as a domestic firm but truly unique origination capabilities. Outbound M&A volume was up significantly in 2012 and Japan became the number two acquirer nation globally versus number nine in 2009. We're also well positioned in sales and trading and have and will continue to benefit from cross-border flows into Japanese equities where we have a nearly 14% share in equity trading.","As we approach the third anniversary of the JV on May 1st, the financial contribution of Morgan Stanley continues to show positive momentum which we expect to continue for some time and was worth calling out at this unique point in transition in Japan. So now let me get back to the broader results and particularly the first quarter and turn it over to Ruth. Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures. The negative impact of DVA in the quarter was 370 million with 238 million in fixed income sales and trading and 79 million in equities sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, online revenues were 8.5 billion, up approximately 13% versus the fourth quarter.","Non-interest expense was 6.5 billion, up 7% versus the fourth quarter. Compensation expense was 4.2 billion this quarter which included approximately 132 million related to severance. Non-compensation expense was 2.3 billion, down 6% from last quarter. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the first quarter was 21%. Excluding discrete items, the effective tax rate was about 30%.","Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders excluding DVA were approximately 1.2 billion. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.61 after preferred dividends. On a GAAP basis, including the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues for the quarter were 8.2 billion. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were 977 million. Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.50 after preferred dividends.","Book value at the end of the quarter was $31.22 per share; tangible book value was $27.39 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were $801 billion at March 31, up from $781 billion last quarter. Deposits were $81 billion consistent with fourth quarter levels. Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $186 billion compared with $182 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. $118 billion of our liquidity this quarter was parent and non-bank liquidity versus $111 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. We increased our liquidity reserve to ensure we\u2019re well positioned for the potential acquisition of the 35% stake in the Wealth Management joint venture.","With respect to our capital ratios, as a reminder beginning this quarter the definition of Basel I capital ratios reflect the implementation of the Basel Committee\u2019s market risk capital framework which is commonly referred to as Basel 2.5. Although our calculations are not final we believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I will be approximately 11.5% and our Tier 1 capital ratio with be approximately 13.9%. For the fourth quarter the pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under the new framework would be 10.6%. Risk-weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately $403 billion at March 31. Subject to final rule making and reflecting our best assessment of the rules, our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was 9.8% as of the end of the first quarter.","Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, revenues, excluding DVA, were $4.4 billion, up 22% sequentially. Non-interest expense was $3.3 billion, up 8% versus the fourth quarter. Compensation which included severance of $113 million was $1.9 million for the first quarter, reflecting a 43% ratio excluding DVA. Excluding DVA and severance the compensation ratio was 40%. Non-compensation expense of $1.4 billion decreased 6% from last quarter. The business reported a pretax profit of $1.1 billion, excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact of DVA, the business reported a pretax profit of $830 million.","In investment banking, revenues of $945 million were down 23% versus last quarter. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked #2 in global completed M&A, and #3 in global equity at the end of the first quarter. Notable transactions included in equity underwriting, Zoetis which raised $2.6 billion in its public offering, the largest IPO of the U.S. Company -- of a U.S. Company in almost a year. In advisory, Benckiser acquired DE Master Blenders for \u20ac7.6 billion and Morgan Stanley served as financial advisor and joint leader ranger on committed financing to the bidder group. And in debt underwriting as joint book runner we successfully priced $3.5 billion of senior unsecured notes for Intelsat, Luxembourg to refinance existing indebtedness.","Advisory revenues of $251 million were down versus our strong fourth quarter results due to lower industry wide volumes and timing of the recognition. Declines were primarily in the Americas. Equity underwriting revenues were $283 million up 19% versus the fourth quarter, driven by improved performance in the U.S. and Asia offset by declines in EMEA. Overall revenue mix for the market was less favorable in the quarter with fewer IPOs in greater block activity. Fixed income underwriting revenues reflected continued strong demand across products although our revenues of $411 million were down versus our record fourth quarter. This quarter the market was more heavily driven by high-yield and leverage loans where our share has historically been lower versus investment grade where we have stronger positioning.","Equity, sales and trading revenues excluding DVA, were $1.6 billion, an increase of 14% from last quarter. Equity revenues were up broadly across products, regions and client segments versus the fourth quarter. Client revenues were the highest levels in over a year driven by market share gains and growth in prime brokerage balances. Prime brokerage balance growth in fact outpaced the overall market due to greater balances from existing clients and from new business. Strength in our core businesses was partially offset by the PDT spin-off that was effective January 1, of this year.","Fixed Income Commodities and Commodity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $1.5 billion. Revenues increased versus our fourth quarter results reflecting seasonal patterns, despite a period of challenging market conditions in March. ","CVA, net of hedges, continued to be a drag this quarter in part due to the tightening of our credit spreads. Results in both macro and credit products were up versus the fourth quarter, driven by strong client activity. In general, clients focused on higher yielding products.","Credit corporates were up significantly as secondary trading volumes increased. Securitized products results outperformed due to very strong volume and several CMBS securitizations in the quarter.","Commodities sales and trading revenues continued to be challenged by cyclical headwinds but were ahead of fourth quarter results. Other sales and trading revenues of 73 million compared with negative revenues of 34 million last quarter. Average trading VAR for the first quarter was 72 million versus 78 million in the fourth quarter.","Turning to Global Wealth Management; revenues of 3.5 billion were up 4% versus the fourth quarter. Asset Management revenues were consistent with the fourth quarter reflecting comparable market levels at the beginning of each period. Transaction revenues increased 15% from last quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of 559 million which increased 5% reflecting greater mutual fund activity despite fewer trading days versus the fourth quarter.","Investment Banking related fees of 274 million which increased 32% versus last quarter, driven by strong activity for closed-end funds and trading revenues of 298 million which were up 22% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of deferred compensation plans and higher fixed income revenues.","Net interest revenue increased 6% to 413 million, in part driven by higher average BDP balances and more efficient deployment of our investment portfolio. Non-interest expense was 2.9 billion, up 4% from last quarter. The compensation ratio was 60% versus 57% in the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonally higher compensation expenses in the first quarter.","Non-compensation expense was 808 million, down 6% versus last quarter, reflecting continued expense discipline and the roll off of platform integration expenses. The PBT margin was 17%.","Profit before tax was 597 million, the highest level of absolute profitability since the inception of the joint venture. Non-controlling interest was 121 million, up from 103 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting stronger results in the joint venture.","Total client assets increased 6% to 1.8 trillion, reflecting higher market levels and inflows. Global fee-based asset inflows were 15.3 billion, fee-based assets under management increased to 621 billion at quarter end. Global representatives were 16,284, essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter.","Bank deposits were 126 billion versus 131 billion at year-end, as clients began to shift back into the market in January. Approximately 69 billion is held in Morgan Stanley banks.","In Asset Management we continued to benefit from the steps we have taken to strengthen the business with higher revenues and another quarter of positive flows into fixed income funds, which is an area of focus for us.","In addition, as of March, in excess of 76% of our Long-Only strategies, excluding liquidity, outperformed their benchmarks over three, five and 10 years. Specifically Asset Management revenues of 645 million were up 8% versus the fourth quarter, driven by higher marks and growth in management and admin fees.","In Traditional Asset Management, revenues of 401 million were up from the fourth quarter, driven by higher global equity markets and continued positive net flows into the Long-Only Business, partially offset by outflows in our liquidity funds.","In Real Estate Investing, revenues increased 24% versus the fourth quarter. Due to the ownership structure of these funds, the majority of these revenues are passed to third-party investors in the non-controlling interest line.","In Merchant Banking, revenues were down compared to the fourth quarter. Expenses were $458 million, up 21% from fourth quarter on higher compensation expense primarily due to DCP. Profit before tax was $187 million, down 15% sequentially. NCI of $51 million was essentially flat in the last quarter, total assets under management increased to $341 billion driven by market appreciation.","In terms of our outlook, a number of factors continue to support our expectation for healthy activity levels not withstanding the persistent structural issue that must be addressed globally. In the U.S. positive economic data are encouraging with monetary policies supporting momentum despite the negative impact of the federal spending reductions rippling through the public and private sectors. Strong liquidity inflow supports both equity and credit market activity as evidenced for example by higher PB balances and the greater engagement by retail investors that was first evidenced in January.","In the euro zone there is work still to be done, however the market liquidity facilitated by the ECB has inspired some reentry by investors, a modest uptick from the low market volumes in prior periods. The Japanese market is clearly benefiting from a surge in investor and corporate activity on the back of the recent bold Central Bank moves there. Notably Japanese retail investors are still heavily in cash while many international investors are under weight the market, suggesting the potential for continued healthy activity.","On the corporate side, global M&A dialogue is active, the CEO seem to require sustained evidence of economic strength to act. The periodic setbacks as evidenced in markets over the last several weeks remainders that global economic recovery and market healing may not come in a straight-line even if major economies are clearly on firmer putting just a year-ago. Against this backdrop we\u2019re confident about the step we\u2019ve taken to enhance Morgan Stanley\u2019s business mix benefiting from leadership position within institutional securities, demonstrable upside in Wealth Management and effective capital optimization. Similarly, the firm\u2019s balance sheet is a source of strength driven by our success in doubling our capital base since 2010 and fundamentally improving both the quantum and durability of liquidity.","Thank you for joining us and James and I will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Good morning.","James P. Gorman","Hi, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","So a handful of questions for you. The first one is I think we can see plenty of evidence of the cost management moving towards, capturing your $1.6 billion expense targets, but what\u2019s the best way for us to track as we go through the year, your specific progress against the $1.6 billion?","Ruth Porat","So, on the $1.6 billion that was based on the calendar year \u201912 actual compensation and our compensation expense I think you know through 2014 and predicated on a flat revenue scenario, so we do remain very comfortable with that target. There is some quarterly seasonality, so I think as we go through the year you will continue to see progress against the $1.6 billion.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Is there some way that maybe starting with next quarter you could actually track against those base lines what you\u2019ve actually captured?","Ruth Porat","We will try and highlight, so you can see the progress that we have in other areas where we\u2019ve laid out the marker and it\u2019s continuing to hit and exceed the goal.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Okay, great. I think that will be helpful. Moving on to just the whole question of the risk-weighted assets and what we saw happening in the fixed income business more broadly in the quarter, you \u2013 what you call that rates and commodities as contributing to the year-over-year decline in fixed income revenues. But what we did see the commodities VaR come down quite a bit if we measure year-over-year the rates bar was actually up pretty materially. Can you help us square that with both the revenue momentum and with the decline that you called out in terms of the FICC RWAs that got you ahead of your year-end targets by the end of the first quarter?","Ruth Porat","Sure. Obviously a couple of questions in that. So, within VaR the interest rate line is obviously both an interest rate and credit line and as you know that it was up year-over-year flat to the last quarter and its effective by couple of things. First and foremost is the measure of risk not necessarily correlated with revenues. It does pick up the activity in credit as you know that I call that out as an area that was quite strong for us both corporate credit and securitized products and mortgage business generally. So it's the function of the shape of the book and volatility of the market generally, but I think what we're looking at when you look at the total line is pretty consistent with prior period, prior year. I think you then had another question regarding risk-weighted assets.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Yeah, I mean to the extent that risk-weighted assets are going to be driven in some measure by your stress VARs, I was just wondering if you could try and reconcile for us the movement in VAR versus the decline in RWAs? And I guess the follow-up question on the RWAs is, if you already exceeded your year-end target, why stick with that as a target basically for the end of the year a couple billion more?","Ruth Porat","So the reduction \u2013 when we look at this reduction over the next period of time to 2016, it's ballpark 60% passive and 40% active. This quarter it was mostly passive. It benefited from the structured credit contract maturities, as James noted, but it also reflected a change in the shape of the book and some other changes such as active mitigation. And our view is that we're very confident that we'll be at that year-end target of 255 billion if not lower, but given part of the reduction was the change in the shape of the book we just built in some degrees of flexibility over the year. And as I said, we're confident we're going to at least meet that year-end target. It may not be a straight-line down quarter-over-quarter just depending on the shape of the book to be higher in the second or third quarter. And again, we remain very committed to the reduction this year and taking it down to that sub-200 level by 2016.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Okay, thanks for that. And then just to sort of continue I guess along the same lines, you allocated a large part of the parent company capital down to ISG, 11 billion in the quarter, after holding a lot of that really at the parent for a pretty long time. Can you talk about what prompted the decision? And is there anything about that move that kind of traps capital in the business in any way if in fact your RWA declines continue and you might otherwise free up capital?","Ruth Porat","So the way we run the business and the way we look at capital is we really won it with a Basel III lens. And as I think you know, we actually charged capital and liquidity down to the business unit \u2013 for the product level, so we can look fully-loaded at risk-adjusted returns. The question then became over the last year or so is what do we do with parent capital given the rule for Basel II and a half and Basel III were still in flight and they hadn't been implemented. And our view was that once the Basel II and a half rules were implemented at the end of last year and so there was complete clarity on it, no guess work and what was being charged to the very segment, it was the appropriate time to take that parent capital number and allocate it up to the businesses. So consistent with moving our Tier 1 common ratio to the Basel II and a half metrics, we allocated the parent capital. And just to make sure it's clear because it can be confusing given the nomenclature. It is still Basel I even though it's using the market risk rules under Basel II and a half, our fourth quarter '12 Basel I number was 14.6, the Basel II and a half for the fourth quarter was 10.6. So if you're looking at where our Basel I ratios were last quarter under an apples-to-apples basis to Basel II and a half 10.6 last quarter going to 11.5 this quarter consistent with reporting ratios that way, parent capital has allocated into the businesses. And then to your very good question of does that mean that there is trapped capital, as we think about the businesses we look at a \u2013 again, a Basel III lens with that [SIFY] buffer and then above that, we believe we have degrees of flexibility with respect to capital return and we're continuing to build that Basel III ratio based on that capital accretion from earnings as well as the capital optimization through things like the risk-weighted asset reduction and so that does give us greater degree of flexibility.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Okay, that's a very helpful description. Thanks. I'll just ask one more which is the Moody's announcement and conference call a couple of weeks back, kind of puts into focus that Morgan Stanley still has a lot of its derivates booked held outside of the bank unit and I was wondering if given what they're talking about doing, that pushes you to try to move more into the bank to the extent that you can?","Ruth Porat","Well, we\u2019ve been focused on moving more into the bank. We continue to write new foreign exchange derivatives in the bank as we\u2019ve talked about on prior calls and move old foreign exchange derivatives into the bank and we do plan to write new interest rates derivatives into the bank this year and timing and speed is really a function of some of the regulatory processes. But I think more broadly on your question about Moody\u2019s we feel good about the steps we\u2019ve taken to position Morgan Stanley for greater quality and consistency of results and accept us up well. We\u2019ve talked a lot about the changes to the business mix and funding on calls like this with clients and counterparties which really all go to the strength of our standalone credit profile and what we\u2019ve done. And I think also when you look at the change in the business mix for example with fixed income, it really moved more towards cash than derivatives, and so that puts us in a good spot. And obviously the industry changed as well in the past year with adjustments post the ratings action. So, it would mute the impact of anything that maybe done on the ratings front, but I think the main thing is our \u2013 we think that all that we\u2019re doing continues to build our standalone credit profile.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Great. Thank you very much.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","Hello.","Ruth Porat","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","Just one quickie follow-up on the RWA reduction and FICC. It doesn\u2019t sound like it had much of an impact on revenues. I just want to make sure that \u2013 I clarify that point.","Ruth Porat","Correct. The majority of it was passive. The active was P&L neutral, and on the structured credit position there wasn\u2019t a P&L impact as we really heads out the revenue and risk.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","Okay, great. And then on commodities; it's been a tough revenue backdrop for everybody given the lower trending prices. I just want to make sure that you still feel this is mostly cyclical trending lower oil and things like that and make sure that there aren\u2019t any structural changes needed to the business.","Ruth Porat","Our view is that, it is a cyclical headwind as you said, it continued backwardation and it won't turn on a dime. Cyclical changes can take time to turn, but it is cyclical. It affects opportunities for us. It affects opportunities for clients related to in particular structured solutions which benefited us last year, but we do view it as cyclical.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","Got you. And in terms of the physical oil, you tend to hedge that at all times, correct?","Ruth Porat","Yeah, we don\u2019t take out right positions. We hedge our physical inventory.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","Super. And last one is, there were some not overly \u2013 not that big but modest shifts of revenues and expenses in the reporting from last quarter from Wealth Management to the institutional securities group, I mean had a drop of an effect on \u2013 positive effect on the margin. But the real impact on the margin besides the good markets was a core drop in non-comp at Wealth Management. And I just want to see is that a function of the systems integration cost running off and this is good run rate to run with?","Ruth Porat","So, a couple of things. In terms of the international Wealth Management market and you nailed it, it's a small move. If you look at the supplement from the fourth quarter to now, it's about a 10 basis point difference, so a small portion of the \u2013 a  small difference. In terms of the overall margin, I think I\u2019d highlight two points. One was the strength of the new issue underwriting activity. In particular closed-end fund activity was very favorable last quarter and that helped on the top line. So, that you can assume we\u2019re going to have the same volume in the next quarter, that was a positive. Expenses clearly we have remained focused on and the integration being done and rolling off was very much as planned and we\u2019re continuing to stay focused on the expense line. But I think if you\u2019re looking forward to the second quarter assume expense is pretty much hold at that level, not withstanding the fact that we remain tight on expense discipline, you\u2019ve got the closed-end fund new issue activity hard to forecast. We do see new issues activity generally a lot of that is outside the U.S. and the real catalyst comes from the U.S. At the same time the S&P is about 10% higher than at the end of the first quarter which benefited our fee based revenues. I think those two revenue items sort of offset one and other. And so at this point we\u2019re holding kind of our margin expectation pretty much in the area where it is although you can see we\u2019ve got a number of leverage that we\u2019re continuing to push.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.","Awesome. Thanks, Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Credit Suisse AG","Hi, good morning, James. Good morning, Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Good morning.","James P. Gorman","Morning.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","On the remainder of the MS\/SB volume, what specific approval are you waiting for from the Fed regarding that?","Ruth Porat","We've gone through obviously the CCAR which is a capital approval and gotten the non-objection there and then the approval Dodd-Frank process approval. We did the same thing last year when we did the 14% buy-in. That approval \u2013 so it's process approval versus capital approval, that approval last year came in May which wasn't really as relevant for timing because we didn't have the call until June and then we went through the arbitration process which took it out basically to the end of the summer. And I'm not suggesting they can read anything into that May date but it's the only proxy we have for what that timeline was at least last year.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Great, thanks for reviewing that, Ruth. And then James, speaking of the CCAR, the test results came in a bit \u2013 your own test results came in a bit below down to the Fed and I just wanted to get your thoughts on what you believe drove that difference? What's in your control to maybe bridge that gap going forward? And how does it impact timing and quantum of the next stage of capital return post the buy-in?","Ruth Porat","Why don't I start on some of the technical? I think you're pointing in particular to our PPNR versus the Fed, which you could see in the disclosure. Our understanding is that the Fed had its own model which relies on historic data and given we've invested meaningfully to increase the quality and consistently of earnings, there have been charges that have obviously been going through the P&L such as MBIA which are negatives and short financials, but on a go-forward basis eliminated drag, improved the quality and consistently of results. And so it's understandable there's a difference between the two if one forecast is based on historic results on the impact and the other is looking at a fundamentally different business mix. We don't know the extent to which those historic results in the Fed model were adjusted and so it's hard to know precisely how the models are different. But that in our view is one of the key things that we're focused on working on over the next period of time before the next submission to (inaudible). That being said if you just look at our fourth quarter earnings and our first quarter earnings, the first two quarters of the CCAR submission that would add an additional 60 basis points to our ratios. So we will be focused on dealing with the PPNR differences and methodology. We are continuing to accrete capital and we think that that does continue to give us degrees of flexibility.","James P. Gorman","And I think Howard, the difference between what we submitted and believed the models should throw out and what ultimately came out of the black box that is the CCAR process was actually narrower \u2013 the difference was narrower than what it was last year. We've obviously got better at it and I think it was relative to some of the other firms out there was frankly not a very surprising result. So we'll play this forward. Our focus now is getting the Smith Barney which we got the capital approved.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Understood, thanks. And then quick numbers on Ruth. I realized \u2013 you said that RWA reduction this quarter was P&L neutral, but what's driving the other sales and trading results. It seems to be less of a headwind than it was in the past.","Ruth Porat","Well, it's a number of items that does move around and it's difficult to model. It includes things like our long-term debt hedging program and our bank liquidity portfolio, our loan book, DCP. So it's kind of an aggregation of a number of different items.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Okay, thanks. And then just finally from me, it remains a pretty fragile environment for you and peers within the Institutional Securities business. I was just hoping you could comment on overall attrition levels, both absolutely and relative to your expectations? Thanks.","Ruth Porat","I think that beginning of the year and having some departures is not in any way unusual. We actually feel very good about the strength of the team. We've got a very talented senior team, been together for many years. We've hired and think it's a great time at Morgan Stanley to be adding senior talent. People are excited to join given the clarity of where we're going and the momentum moving in that direction. So it's kind of seasonal and we don't read anything into it.","James P. Gorman","And more specifically, the attrition is actually trekking along exactly what it was last year. And I believe and Celeste will correct me later, a little low than what it was the year before.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Perfect. Thanks so much for taking questions.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets","Hi. I guess my questions can be grouped into the good, bad and the ugly; so I'll start with the ugly. Financial advisory, if you look at it linked quarter or year-over-year among the five largest U.S. players, it looks to perform the worst based on fees and you had some management changes there. Can you reassure that franchise is still as strong as it\u2019s been historically?","Ruth Porat","Yes, it is. The M&A lead tables are exactly the same as they were last year, it tends to be lumpy in the first quarter and particular given market environment with low activity of levels and we\u2019re consistent leader of a very strong M&A franchise as I noted in my comments, part of it is just that lower volume and it tends to be lumpy and part of it we had a very strong fourth quarter and there were some fee realization that moved in \u2013 within the fourth quarter, so that partially explains it as well, but we feel very good about this and I think if you\u2019re just objectively look at the lead table, this year and last year it [dwells] throughout the year.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets","And then in my bad category the actions of buybacks, I know you\u2019re not able to do that, but trading at such a big discounted tangible book if you have confidence in the value of your balance sheet, which I assume you do, why wouldn\u2019t you take more aggressive actions to downsize and why not be more aggressive with your big targets? Why not take some other action to strength to move up that Basel III ratio even faster?","James P. Gorman","Well, I think Mike there are couple of questions meshed together there. I think the actions on reducing our risk-weighted assets and fixed income from I believe it was $390 billion in the third quarter of \u201911 to $253 billion this year, we\u2019re a year ahead of schedule last year and we\u2019re at the end of the years point already in the first quarter of this year, it would be easy to reduce it faster, but you would also destroy revenues and destroy good businesses. So, our job is to balance a sensible risk-weighted asset reduction without destroying revenues and parts of that business that we find very attractive. So, we actually think we\u2019ve been very aggressive bringing it down from $390 billion to a committed sub $200 billion by 2016. If we see more sensible opportunities which don\u2019t destroy value, obviously we\u2019d be all over it.","The capital buyback is completely different topic. The \u2013 as we said at the beginning of the year, we adopted a very clear posture with our regulators, which was that our focus was on the strategic benefits of buying Smith Barney for two reasons. One, it was an attractive business and being already carrying the effective cost of the capital for that business, so we wanted the earnings from it. And its $600 million pre-tax a quarter, 35% is real money. So that was our focus. We didn\u2019t want anything to get into the road to that focus. We did not want to jeopardize that focus by prejudging where we come out on CCAR or prejudging how the beginning of the year would start. The beginning of the year has started at $1.2 billion, significantly above where we were in the fourth quarter as CCAR came out at 5.7, I think 5.6 net of the capital allocation in this. So we\u2019re now waiting for the federal reserves to go through the application process. When they do that we know our number and as we go through the year, obviously the next question we\u2019ve for ourselves is when and under what conditions we have to see buybacks, but we\u2019re not going to react very short-term on this. We\u2019re trying to do get this firm back on the rails which we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years in a very deliberate path and we believe we\u2019re now well on that path.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets","And then the good category would be the brokerage margin which came in higher than what you guys had expected last quarter. What is your brokerage margin target? Is it still 15%, it seems pretty low and you had one peer yesterday reported margin over 20%. So what are you really trying to achieve margin wise in that business?","James P. Gorman","Well, I have to take that one again Mike, because I was the one who foolishly couple of years ago went out with a 20% margin when we had then three years of zero interest rates following out. So I admitted to my mistake on that and we set a more conservative margin target for the middle of this year, which was 15%. The fact, we\u2019re ahead of it is good news. Now we\u2019re certainly not going to turnaround and reset margins based upon short-term impact. So our job is less around what\u2019s setting the margins is actually delivering them and what I\u2019m pleased about is the fact that we\u2019re delivering those margins. The competitor numbers I\u2019m not going to talk about except to observe that they actually have a different business mix that comprises that ultimate margin number.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets","Was there anything unusual with the 17% margin this quarter or can we consider that a base looking ahead?","Ruth Porat","No, there was nothing unusual. As I said the strength versus what is usually a seasonally lower margin, it's typically seasonally low because compensation expense tends to be a bit higher in the first quarter. But what we had offsetting that, as I noted, was the stronger transactional volume, the new issue activity with closed-end funds. That really helped coupled with the ongoing expense discipline. And so if we look forward, you're starting with the good base in the first quarter was at 17%.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets","Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of questions. First of all, on the deposits, you saw about 4% decline in deposits in Wealth Management, I think overall 3% down. Was that largely seasonal or was there something else going on there?","Ruth Porat","Deposits came up in December. We saw some selling out of the markets. We think it was primarily tax driven by investors as distinct from real concern about the market. But our expectation was that it would come back into the market in the beginning of the first quarter and it did. So it's really just the positioning by investors at the end of last year, then coming back into the market and staying in the market as they have. So no, there's not anything more to it than that.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. And then just thinking about your debt underwriting business, given that there's obviously been pretty strong demand for that product over the last couple of years, you've admitted that you're a little bit subscale on high yields relative to some of your competitors. Does that have any effect on your desire for a couple 100 basis points of market share gains within fixed income if that business continues to be relatively robust over the next couple of years?","Ruth Porat","No. We set a target of 2% market share increase, kind of 8% total market share for fixed income sales and trading. We feel very confident with that given the products that our fixed income underwriting, which is actually reported \u2013 those sales are reported in the investment banking line and we did have a record \u2013 we had a record quarter last quarter. The first quarter was actually the best ever first quarter that we've had. What that ends up driving is the secondary sales and trading as you know well, but we feel very good about \u2013 we remain very much focused on our share gains, equally focused on how we optimize returns. So it's really both of those, but no change.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. And then let me just confirm finally; the 60% compensation ratio in Wealth Management, you mentioned last quarter that that we should about that ratio being pretty unchanged for the next couple of quarters. What would allow you to get that ratio down presuming a steady revenue environment? And is that something that we should be looking for towards the end of the year?","Ruth Porat","The 60% compensation ratio in the first quarter is precisely the reason we had indicated that the margin tends to be seasonally weaker in the first quarter, these tend to have fairly higher comp in the first quarter or things like FICA and other factors. So it does tend to be a bit higher. Coming down a point or so near term is very \u2013 it's a reasonable way to think about it, but the great \u2013 the best driver of the comp ratio over time is really the growth of our lending product. As we talked about, we're going to have deposits up to about 140 billion in the two years, post buying in the rest of the Wealth Management business. That's going to support growth of both Wealth Management lending product and Institutional product. And on the Wealth Management side, it's on a different compensation grid relative to the [formulate] grid that generally drives that comp ratio and that is what really gives us meaningful operating leverage in the comp line and that brings it down to the high 50s.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Hi. Good morning. ","James P. Gorman","Good morning.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Just want to follow-up on \u2013 you're sitting on about 23% of your balance sheet in excess liquidity. Can you discuss where you are sitting in terms of the LCR, do you feel like you're pretty comfortable for that or do you need to build more?","Ruth Porat","On the LCR, we're over 125% and that really has given all that we've done terming out the secured book. It's obviously just a 30-day test and we do triangulate, as we've talked about on some prior calls, with an outlook over 12-month period of time in a stress environment. One of the reasons liquidity is running at these higher levels as I noted, is that we want to ensure that we have ample liquidity assuming we do acquire the 35% of Wealth Management. So there\u2019s a bit of flexibility thereafter.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay, maybe just to follow-up on -- as you buy in the rest, should we -- what is the timing around the deposits and how quickly do you think you can reinvest, and then I guess longer term do you think that can help you bring down the excess liquidity and obviously help to improve profitability?","Ruth Porat","So, the deposits, the way it works is, they come in over the two-year period of time. We get about 14 billion of deposits within a few weeks of closing, and then 40 billion ratably over the following 24 months. And that will -- that supports as I just said both retail lending as well as institutional lending. And I think the best way to think about it is, one it gives us growth opportunities because there\u2019s a suite of products within institutional securities that haven\u2019t grown as much as they could because they would be funded with unsecured debt versus substantially more efficient deposits, but they\u2019re still bank appropriate areas and areas where we have, we\u2019ll expertise. So, whether you\u2019re talking about project finance or commercial real-estate those are good examples of areas where we get our incremental growth opportunities based on our competencies today and our clients today, but it would be funded with more efficient deposits in the bank. And then there are also areas where we will be able to move businesses from institutional securities into the bank and that enabled us to do it dollar-for-dollar substitution, reducing unsecured debt and replacing that with deposit funding which is more efficient. And so yes there is some efficiency that comes in, in that way. And then overall if the question is also and what does that do for liquidity. As those deposits which are currently really supporting the AFS portfolio go into support the lending product the bank liquidity comes down as those are moving into support loan growth.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","So we should see that excess liquidity start to come down, as those deposits come in?","Ruth Porat","Yeah, it's all \u2013 if you take a look over time the answer to that is yes, but as those deposits come in for example that first 14 billion of deposits \u2026","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Oh, sure. Right, in the short-term it could go up.","Ruth Porat","It goes up; then it goes into the AFS portfolio; it's positive carry on the AFS portfolio as it comes down again because it's supporting loan growth. Yes, it does come down again but at a higher return.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Right. Okay, thanks a lot.","Ruth Porat","Thanks.","Operator","The final question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Knocking under the wire. Good morning, guys.","Ruth Porat","Brennan, good morning.","James P. Gorman","Good morning.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So, just a quick follow-up on FICC, it was obviously pretty volatile in some of these markets here this quarter. Is there any, which we think about maybe the fact that revenue might have been a little bit lower than usual just because there might have been some principal loss given some of that volatility and this is actually really a pretty lousy run rate?","Ruth Porat","You know the run rate we do think given the markets where more challenging especially in March just affected activity and as I noted rates was lower and then commodities is dealing with a cyclical headwinds we\u2019ve talked about. So, I think it is very fair to say we don\u2019t deal a $1.5 billion of revenues. Our revenues this quarter is a ceiling on what\u2019s attainable, even with quarterly seasonality. And you know I point you to the strength that we have in a lot of areas like credit and the mortgage product and foreign exchange and we\u2019d expect that rate \u2013 rates are higher, so we do think that given the strength of the client activity levels that there is upside from here. I think an interesting way to even just look at client activity and volumes across the platform is just looking at the brokerage and clearing line which is up, which really goes to client activity. So long way of saying it, if we don\u2019t think that $1.5 billion in revenues is a ceiling and look forward to the continued activity.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But where there any principal losses to specifically highlight or was it mostly volume driven within the FICC line?","Ruth Porat","It was not principal losses, no.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. Thanks. And on capital, once I understand that its uncertain about when you get the green light on MSSB, but if we assume that happens prior to mid-year, is it too aggressive for us to think about given where you guys are on the capital ratio front. In fact at MSSB is already fully baked into Basel III that you could be looking to take a second bite of the apple here with the regulators in a potential buyback with a \u2013 with the new submission?","Ruth Porat","Well as James said, our number one focus is closing the Wealth Management acquisitions, given the strategic benefit in the upside, promoting 100%. So, we're just focused on closing that acquisition, which was our capital progress. We are accreting capital. Your question is fair, but we want to get it closed before we think about anything else.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I figured I'd give that a shot. And then the last one. The lending platform, is there anything operationally that you guys are waiting on to get going because it seems as though you have excess deposits currently. So it's not really a matter of funding and not having the right funding. So, is there like a system investment process you need to go through in order to get everything up and running? Or is there any operational issues holding you back? Do you want to have all of MS\/SB completely bought in before you really start more aggressively pushing the lending platform? I guess I don't understand what's \u2013 why it's been so slow to ramp so far?","Ruth Porat","In 2009, it became clear that over time we would be buying in the remainder of the Wealth Management business, and at that point started investing in the systems, the risk management personnel, analytics to ensure that at the point we ended up with the full 140 billion in place, we had the systems and infrastructure requirements there. The gating factor is and we've used this word so often in describing how we're building up the banking team and the banking effort within Wealth Management its prudent consistent growth. There is no reason to rush it. We want to make sure that we do it in a high quality way and that we're leading with risk management. So, it is better to do it prudently over time than to try and rush it. That is really the governor of the growth in that business. We feel good about the strength and the build. As James said, it's both on the mortgage side and on the PLA side and that's what we're continuing to do.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay.","Ruth Porat","I will note one other thing, we've said this I think last quarter that relative to our peers we are under penetrated in the lending product, and so what we're seeing is good take up and we're just keeping it at a measured pace.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. At some point after that book assuming that you guys want to grow that book to a certain size. Does that mean that there will be a transition to accrual accounting and we'll start to see sort of that level of detail for you all?","Ruth Porat","Well, so we talked about the fact a couple of quarters \u2013 I think over a year ago now that we moved from fair value to HFI for our lending products, that's most relevant for what we're doing on the institutional side. And at this point, about 69% of the book is on HFI. So that has been the approach that was very clear coming out of the CCAR process over a year ago that that was a logical way to approach it and that's what we've been doing systematically.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Thanks.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Celeste Mellet Brown","Great. Thank you so much for joining us and we look forward to speaking to you in a quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call.

This is Kathleen McCabe, Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.","The presentation may also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings including this quarter\u2019s earnings release and financial supplement at www.morganstanley.com for a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley. This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Office James Gorman.","James Gorman","Thank you, Kathleen, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. The second quarter was very solid across our businesses. We grew earnings year-over-year 34% excluding DVA and the prior year quarter net discrete tax benefit, and as a result, delivered an ROE ex-DVA of 9.1% for the quarter.","We also continue to execute on our strategic plan and deliver on our stated goals. Once again equities was a notable highlight driven by strength in cash, derivatives and prime brokerage across the globe.","Banking was strong. We finished the quarter ranked number one in global IPOs, number two in announced M&A. In particular, we delivered strong performance in fixed income underwriting. The pipeline remains healthy. In fixed income and commodities, we continue to deliver improving results.","Our fixed strategy remains unchanged and we continue to execute on our strategic plan to reshape fixed-income and commodities into a more focused business. We have reduced balance sheet, risk weighted assets, and expenses while maintaining a client focus consistent with our strategy. We believe the recent two notch upgrade and some of the developments in the competitive landscape may give rise to additional opportunity.","In Wealth Management, we remain on plan and delivered a 23% margin. Consistent with our strategy, we also completed the final stage of deposit on boarding and now have close to $140 billion of deposits. We continue to deploy those deposits as part of our bank lending strategy, an important component of our future performance and growth.","Finally, in Investment Management, we delivered a strong quarter that benefited particularly from investment gains in merchant banking and real estate investing. As recent market volatility, particularly driven by events in Greece and China has demonstrated, the near-term landscape can change quickly. This kind of short-term volatility does not change our long-term strategy.","Our trading performance can, of course vary meaningfully in the near-term, the stability of our fee-based businesses gives us comfort that a large portion of our business offers us a more predictable outlook. Furthermore, given our business mix we are overweight the U.S. and benefit from the real and sustainable recovery that is taking place. This balance positions us to continue to live up for our clients and our shareholders.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thanks, James. Good morning everyone. I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results and then James and I will be happy to take your questions. Before I discuss the individual businesses, I will first make a few comments on our overall performance.","Revenues were $9.7 billion in the second quarter or $9.6 billion excluding DVA. Revenues are up nicely this quarter, 13% versus second quarter 2014 or 12% excluding DVA. Against that revenue backdrop, we were able to keep expenses well-managed up 5% year-over-year demonstrating operating leverage in our business. The efficiency ratio was 72% in the second quarter and we remain very focused on expense management both in terms of comp and non-comp expenses.","Our effective tax rate was approximately 33% this quarter due to our geographic mix of earnings and given that we would guide you to an effective tax rate of 32% for the rest of 2015.","ROE was 9.9% or 9.1% ex-DVA. We saw strength across certain products and geographies, but still have opportunities to improve results and we are keenly focused on our goal of delivering a sustainable 10% ROE.","Now to the businesses. Our Institutional Securities franchise showed resiliency in the face of more challenging markets in the second quarter. We continue to see a gradual global recovery led by developed markets. Not surprisingly Europe was a softer market and we expect a continuation of muted activity and volumes in the near-term.","We are optimistic about growth in the U.S. and see significant client engagement in greater China. Revenues were $5.2 billion or $5 billion excluding DVA, down 5% and 6% versus first quarter \u201915. A significant portion of the decline is attributable to our commodities business where we saw less client engagement and lower volatility.","Non-interest expense was down 3% versus the first quarter. Excluding DVA, the compensation ratio was 38% below our stated target of 39%.","In Investment Banking, we remain encouraged by the level of strategic activity and have seen an increase in the velocity and size of deals. Deal activity is more diversified, the composition is more varied and we\u2019ve seen more cash deals. Buyers are willing to move unilaterally and cross-border activity is up. Investor reactions to strategic transactions have been positive and this has led to nearly $2 trillion in global activity year-to-date.","For the quarter, revenues in Investment Banking were $1.4 billion, up 23% sequentially. As of June 30, Morgan Stanley ranked number one in global IPOs, number two in global announced M&A, and number four in U.S. investment grade debt. Notable transactions in the quarter include an advisory; Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisor to Time Warner Cable on the announced acquisition by Charter Communications valued at $79 billion.","In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley as lead left book runner priced Fitbit\u2019s $841 million IPO. At $841 million, Fitbit is the largest consumer electronics IPO in history. This transaction highlights Morgan Stanley's continued leadership in transformative technology IPOs.","In fixed income underwriting, we acted as lead left book runner on AbbVie\u2019s sixth tranche $16.7 billion debt offering to finance its previously announced acquisition. We delivered related debt, equity and risk management solutions around this offering. This transaction is a great example of our ability to deliver solutions for clients across M&A, capital markets, and risk products, as well as the power of our partnership with MUFG who is involved in the initial bridge loan.","Turning to the individual businesses, advisory revenues of $423 million decreased 10% versus the first quarter driven by a decrease in the Americas and EMEA, partially offset by increases in Asia. Underwriting revenues were strong at $1 billion driven by a pickup in primary equity issuance and an industry record for quarterly new issue volumes for U.S. investment grade debt, which was aided by an uptick in M&A related financing.","Equity underwriting revenues were up 59% versus first quarter, primarily reflecting increases in follow-ons, secondary sales, and IPOs. Fixed-income underwriting revenues were up 34% versus a strong first quarter. The pipelines are healthy and while the third quarter historically maybe seasonally lighter for capital markets; we think longer-term positive trends remain intact.","In equity sales and trading, our global footprint continues to serve us well. We saw particular strength in Asia, where we have leading market position and cash volumes were up significantly. Performance in the U.S. continued to be strong lead by prime brokerage and derivatives.","Equity sales and trading had another excellent quarter with $2.3 billion of revenue, driven by high levels of client activity across all products. Prime brokerage revenues increased in all regions quarter-over-quarter and derivative revenues remain strong, but were down off of the first quarter.","Our first half results in equities are a testament to the strength of our equity franchise and leadership team. We believe that we have a number one global position year-to-date driven by our focus on clients and best-in-class execution. We are confident in our position and strategy, although results will be a function of client activity and volumes.","In fixed-income and commodities this quarter, we further executed on our stated strategy. We remain focused on reshaping and optimizing this business, as well as on efficiency and how we manage all resources. For the quarter, fixed-income and commodity sales and trading revenues were $1.3 billion excluding DVA, down 33% versus the first quarter.","As I noted before, a significant portion of the decline is attributable to our commodities business where we saw less client engagement and lower client activity. We also saw declines in EMEA off of a very strong first quarter which included the benefit of the start of QE.","Our rates business performed well, although down from the first quarter while the environment for our traditionally strong credit businesses remain softer. We continue to be disciplined on risk weighted assets in end of the quarter at a $157 billion of FIC RWAs.","A meaningful portion of this decline was driven by a reduction in risk as client activity decreased, while Greece dominated the headlines in the middle of June, as well as our continued passive roll off. We anticipate variability in RWAs, as client reengage and re-establish risk positions while staying below our target of $180 billion.","During the quarter, consistent with our strategy of exiting physical oil, we also announced the sale of our global oil merchanting business and expect that to close later this year.","We\u2019ve dramatically reshaped our business at the same time that the market and our competitors are going through significant disruption, which brings both opportunities and challenges. We have reduced headcount, balance sheet, and RWAs, while remaining a full service global fixed-income partner to our top clients. Rebuilding the business takes time, but year-to-date we have shown progress, in particular, in rates and foreign exchange, though there is more work to be done.","Other revenues were up versus last quarter driven primarily by fees and marks on our lending and event book. Lastly, average trading bar for the second quarter was $54 million, up slightly driven by increased client activity and choppier markets.","Turning to Wealth Management. Our view remains positive as recovery further plays out in the U.S. We see steady performance in our business with growth coming from our bank strategy and fee-based programs. Revenues for the quarter were up 1% sequentially. Asset management revenues were up 3% from last quarter driven by higher fee-based client balances from positive flows.","Global based asset inflows were $13.9 billion bringing total fee-based client assets to 18 --- to $813 billion at quarter end, representing 40% of client assets. We continue to see softness in transactional revenues which were down 8% compared to last quarter, as retail investor activity has yet to increase from subdued levels.","Consistent with the execution of our U.S. bank strategy, net interest revenue increased 7% to $737 million, driven by growth in lending and realization of the forward curve in our Investment Securities portfolio.","Wealth Management lending balances grew $4 billion or 10% from the prior quarter. Non-interest expenses were essentially flat to last quarter and the compensation ratio was 57% driven by increases in non-compensable revenues. As James mentioned in its comments, the PBT margin was 23%.","Deposits in our bank deposit program were $132 billion, down versus the first quarter reflecting seasonality. Wealth Management representatives were down 1% versus the first quarter.","In Investment Management, revenues were up 12% sequentially driven by gains in the real estate and merchant banking business and total AUM ended the quarter at $403 billion.","Turning to balance sheet and capital, total assets were $825 billion at June 30, down from $829 billion at the end of the first quarter. In the last few weeks of June, the balance sheet came down as clients took risk off due to disruptions in the market.","Our global liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $188 billion compared with $195 billion at the end of the first quarter. Our capital ratios continue to strengthen, reflecting our best estimates of the Federal Reserve final rules, our pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratio, using the Basel III fully phased-in advance approach was 12.5% at June 30. Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $429 billion, down from $448 billion in the first quarter.","We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the U.S. final rule to be approximately 5.3% at June 30, up from 5.1% at the end of first quarter. All of these estimates are preliminary and are subject to revision.","During the second quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 16 million shares under our 2015 CCAR approved higher level and our Board declared a $0.15 dividend per share.","To close my prepared remarks, we saw two different quarters in 2015 in terms of market dynamics, client activity, and volatility. Our global footprint and business mix were able to deliver stable results throughout these two quarters.","With that, we will open-up the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks very much. So you have done well across just about every business. I'm trying to get a feel for is, how much seasonality we should think about? And I know it\u2019s always hard to answer, but between Asian equities so strong and second half usual seasonality in FIC and the big results in merchant banking and real estate, I\u2019m just looking for any guidance on how much of that we should expect moderating in the second half, just on seasonality?","Jonathan Pruzan","Well, great. I think as you said, Glenn, the business was much more balanced in the first half across all of our businesses and all of our products, in all our -- all of our geographies in terms of seasonality. All I would say is from a capital markets perspective, the third quarter is usually seasonally slower, but that\u2019s all I would really comment.","Glenn Schorr","Maybe on the merchant bank and real estate, is that a function of sales or its just really good environment and having things to mark up?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, I think as you point out in merchant banking and our real estate business, we did see good principal gains in the quarter. It was a combination of both marks in distributions and it's been a good environment for monetizations here.","Glenn Schorr","James noted the two notch upgrade may help in FIC. Can we talk about specifically where and maybe also just flush out within FIC. Normally your great and strong credit -- obviously that was weaker, but your results held up really well to your point on rates and FX. Have -- do you feel like you\u2019ve fully transitioned to a more balanced business?","Jonathan Pruzan","There were lot of questions in there. In terms of the Moody\u2019s upgrade as we said, we\u2019ve gotten some positive feedback from our clients. We were pleased with that result. But I wouldn\u2019t necessarily tie the upgrade to any specific level of performance in FIC. The balance -- the business was much balanced, much more balanced in the first half across products and geographies. You did point out that our historically strong credit businesses and SBG businesses are a little bit softer. We did see strong results across regions in rates in the first half. The FX business was strong in the first quarter given the positive trend in volatility in the U.S., euro FX movements that did come down a little bit in the second quarter as currencies traded in a tighter band and there was more muted volumes, but it was still a strong quarter for us. So I don\u2019t -- I wouldn\u2019t say that we are done here, but we are clearly pleased with the progress that we made and there is more to be done.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning.","James Gorman","Good morning.","Brennan Hawken","Starting out in capital markets, and Glenn touched on this a little bit, the Asian strength definitely a driver again this quarter. Maybe can you help us understand how much of a tailwind that was and then also given some of the volatility we have seen since the end of the second quarter, how are clients reacting to that and what is your expectation for continued strength in the region?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. First I will comment our Asia-Pacific results and business, we are strong across all our businesses, equities, fixed income, and investment banking this quarter. We do have a diversified business not only in China, but across all of Asia. So it's not just China and it\u2019s really all products. We did benefit from activity levels being higher in China this quarter. We did see increased volatility there, but given the liberalization of the capital markets in that region we\u2019ve seen significant increases in investor interest in the region. It's obviously a large and important region and has significant growth opportunities there. So we would expect that level of engagement to continue. We saw lots of volatility in the second quarter. I would say that was more broadly dominated with some macro headlines towards the end of the year, not just in China, so we did see as we said risk positions come down and client engagement slow down a little bit in the back half of June and early parts of July. I would say we have started to see some of those headlines tied down and a little bit more stability in some of the volatility indexes come down, particularly in U.S. and in Europe. So we\u2019re starting to see some more reengagements by our clients and our investors. But I wouldn\u2019t -- I would say it\u2019s a little too early to say anything about the quarter, but we feel good about the client activity and the client engagement.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then on FIC, clearly year-to-date results have bounced back nicely. What\u2019s your view on returns in that business currently? Can you give us an idea of what returns you\u2019ve been generating here year-to-date and whether or not that is what you\u2019re hoping for in an environment like this, and how much more juice there is for continued improvement there?","Jonathan Pruzan","As we\u2019ve mentioned many, many times, we have been focused on reshaping and optimizing that business. We are clearly focused on improving the ROE in that business and we think we\u2019ve made real progress here in the first half. We think there is still more opportunity. Some of those opportunities include continuation of the balance sheet optimization strategy that we have. We are very focused also on the velocity of our balance sheet and even though we\u2019ve kept a tight lid on expenses, we still think there is more to be done in that area as well.","James Gorman","I would just add to that, that obviously we have done a lot of internal restructuring both in cost and in balance sheet. Clearly we have a very focused stable team running our FIC business. We saw the two notch upgrade from Moody\u2019s as Jon said you can\u2019t draw a direct line from that to activity, but at best, at worse it\u2019s neutral and the best it\u2019s more than that and the feedback from some clients is that over time it will be additive. And as others have observed in the global FIC investment banking sales trading marketplace, there is clearly more turmoil in other parts of world than there is in the U.S. and we think that there is potential for over a period of time for share gain for our business. So we take a long view on this. We don\u2019t really focus on -- I mean we obviously report on the quarterly basis, but we don\u2019t get that excited quarter-to-quarter. We are more focused on how we\u2019re moving this business over a four or five year period and obviously the more recent result suggest it\u2019s moving in the right direction.","Brennan Hawken","Yes. No, agreed. And then switching gears over to Wealth Management, the continued grind down in comp expense, how much of that -- is that purely mix driven? And then as we start to see some rate tail wind here, God willing, that only continues to support the mix shift, right. And then when you think about your loan to deposit ratio it\u2019s still low. So should we think about any change in loan growth with Citi's deposits all on boarded now?","Jonathan Pruzan","So I think in our Wealth Management business the drivers are still pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters both in terms of the fee-based businesses as well as the deposit deployment and the improvement in NII. We think that both those trends will continue. We\u2019ve been very focused on the expense side of the equation. We\u2019ve been benefiting from increasing NII and therefore non-compensable revenues. I believe the expense ratio came in -- the comp expense ratio came in at 57% this quarter. Our stated target is 55%, so we will continue to drive towards that target. PBT margin was 23%, so that was up nicely from the second quarter. In terms of our deposit deployment strategy and our excess liquidity in our banks, we still think that has room to play out and that will be a continuation and the primary driver of our NII growth going forward. We saw $4 billion of loan lending balances increases in the Wealth Management business this quarter. We saw lending balances increase about $6 billion in totality, so we had about $2 billion of growth from our Institutional Securities client and we see that trends continuing as well. So again, a nice steady quarter in Wealth Management and we\u2019d expect those trends to continue.","Brennan Hawken","Great. Thanks for all that color and congrats on the solid momentum.","James Gorman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Guy Moszkowski","Good morning. So we hear some commentary about potential for FIC share gains obviously there was some press a few weeks ago about whether or not there was a strategic change. At the same time I\u2019m looking at capital balances in institutional and they are down about a couple billion dollars this quarter. I was wondering if you could help us understand how the two things are trading off, the potential for perhaps more FIC engagement and market share and on the other hand the decline in the capital that\u2019s allocated to the Institutional Securities group?","James Gorman","Well, let me just start with talking about the strategic issue and given that it was in the press and it\u2019s been raised and I tried to address it in my opening comments. It\u2019s a good example of don't believe everything you read in the newspaper. And I read a lot of things in the newspaper not knowing the facts I\u2019ve learned not to believe all of them. What is true is that we did have a two notch upgrade. What is also true is that a number of institutions are going through a relook\/restructuring of their fixed income businesses, which is obviously public. And thirdly what is true is that we have been through that process over the last several years and feel like we have a business right sized where the risk weighted assets have come down from I don\u2019t know, Guy, about four years ago there were 390 billion I think in FIC and there we just reported somewhere close in the 160s. So it may be even lower than that. So what we\u2019ve said is the strategy is not changing. That doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t get more velocity on sheet. That doesn\u2019t mean we are not going to be more efficient providers and it doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t pick up share and that does mean that as these markets continue to grow relatively low volumes there won\u2019t be more opportunity for us on the revenue side. So its -- we are not trying to make it more complicated than that. This was a very solid quarter, not a sensational quarter in FIC. Obviously, the fact we are up year-over-year. It was important, but also to be honest a year-ago, we had a relatively light quarter. So we wanted to be up and we needed to be up and we proved we could be.","Guy Moszkowski","And just a follow-up on the reduction and capital that -- that\u2019s allocated currently to Institutional Securities. Is that as simple as what you talked about in the opening remarks, that the balance sheet was smaller at the end of the quarter and it was going to kind of bounce around that way, or is there something more strategic going on with respect to for example, run-off of some of those legacy positions that you were talking about that\u2019s driving down that FIC RWA, that's driving the -- almost $2 billion reduction in capital NIS?","James Gorman","Well there is certainly nothing strategic going on behind it. I\u2019ll let Jon talk about where we ended with the capital in the quarter.","Jonathan Pruzan","Guy, I think your first comments were accurate regarding the balance sheet usage.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. Fair enough. And then just a follow-up on that. A $1 billion increase in what\u2019s allocated to Wealth Management whether we look at average common equity or common equity Tier 1 linked quarter, what\u2019s driving that?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, in terms of those disclosures I think you see a couple of things here. The parent is increased driven by the less segment usage as we just talked about plus the earnings accretion that we had and then the mix is driven by each segments relative contribution to the total.","Guy Moszkowski","Fair enough. And then just one more thing that was topical for investors during the quarter based on your 10-Q. I know you addressed it a little bit at your conference a few weeks ago, but maybe you can talk a little bit about the decline in interest rate sensitivity that was evident in your Q, the degree to which that might have reflected just a difference in asset deployment strategy, securities versus loans, whatever and whether there are any risk management elements that we need to think about with respect to the change there?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. I think there is a couple of different questions in there. Maybe I can try to address them in two parts. First would just be our overall interest rate position and how we think about NII, and then the second part of the question really around the disclosures. Let me address the first one. As you heard from James, the on boarding of the Citi deposits came to conclusion this quarter. We brought on a little over $4 billion in the quarter and that program has now run its course. The NII was up nicely and we expect a continuation of that trend. The primary driver of that as we\u2019ve said before is the deposit deployment strategy. If you look in the supplement you will see that our investment portfolio was down about $5 billion this quarter and our lending balances were up $6 billion. I mentioned $4 billion of that from Wealth Management clients and $2 billion from Institutional Securities clients. That\u2019s obviously critically important because as you remember from our January presentation where we laid out some illustrative asset yields you saw that our lending products were generating 150 to 250 basis points more of yield than our AFS or cash or short-term investments. So that is the primary driver of the improvements in NII. We are also starting to see the natural run-off in our investment portfolio being reinvested in higher rates and the realization of the forward curve that\u2019s a couple billion dollars a quarter. And then lastly just on our overall interest rate positioning, our NII growth and results are in line and consistent with where we were in the beginning of the year in terms of our views. On the actual disclosure that we have in the Q, a couple comments there. First, you should know that we don\u2019t manage to any individual rate scenario or rate shock, instead we\u2019re trying to optimize across the range of possible outcomes. The second comment about that disclosure is you know it\u2019s a 12 month disclosure and we\u2019re clearly focused on a longer term view when we think about our balance sheet and our interest rate positioning. That disclosure as you know is an instantaneous and parallel shock above the base case. So it is our 12 month forward NII base case. The important thing to realize there is that our base case includes two critical things. One of them is our own, which is our deposit deployment strategy which is the primary driver of our NII growth and the second is we use the implied forward curve and today the implied forward curve has 225 basis points increases in the fed fund rates. So we have captured much of NII expectations already in our base case. And the last point I would make is that, that number and that disclosure is going to move around as we manage our overall interest rate risk in the bank.","Guy Moszkowski","Great. That\u2019s actually all really helpful color. I appreciate you taking the time.","Jonathan Pruzan","Okay. Thanks.","James Gorman","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Michael Mayo","Hi. My first question is on Wealth Management. You said you have a $140 billion of deposits of what's left to redeploy and we estimate a Wealth Management net interest margin of 2%. What would you consider a normal NIM for that business?","Jonathan Pruzan","So in terms of the first part of your question Michael, I think as we said the deposit deployment strategy is one of the critical strategies in wealth and we still think that, that has plenty of room to play out here. We still have excess liquidity in the bank and we will be redeploying those cash balances into the lending product for the foreseeable future. I\u2019m sorry, the second part of the question?","Michael Mayo","Yes. What is your NIM in the Wealth Management business? We\u2019re estimating 2%, but if you want to clarify that. But what do you think is the normal margin for lending in Wealth Management?","Jonathan Pruzan","That\u2019s really a hard question. As you know, we do have an overall bank strategy, part of that benefit of having the bank appears in Wealth Management, a part of it appears in other parts of our businesses. So that\u2019s not really how we look at it. We\u2019re obviously focused on the overall PBT in that margin -- PBT in that business which came in at 23%, which is we said before was up nicely and we continue to hopefully make progress in that going into the future quarters.","Michael Mayo","So, where do you hope the 23% ratio to go over time?","Jonathan Pruzan","We\u2019ve stated in the beginning of the year that our target is between 22% and 25% for the year. We\u2019re obviously inside of that target and we\u2019re going to continue to try to make progress there both on the revenue side and the expense side.","Michael Mayo","Alright let me switch to Institutional Securities. Prime brokerage, you said has gone up in all regions, and we lack some transparency to see some of the data underneath. Can you just give us some sense as to whether its market share or a percentage increase or really just why. We know many clients left during the crisis. Is that still a factor people coming back or what's the underlying reason for that growth?","Jonathan Pruzan","Listen, I think the underlying reason for the growth in all of our business is our client engagement and client activity. We\u2019ve just seen a significant pick up around the world and around the globe in terms of engagement with our clients and we\u2019re there to meet our client\u2019s needs and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve seen the growth in our balances.","Michael Mayo","Okay. How about just a general question, the ROE on a core basis is 9%, and that\u2019s below some of your peers and I know the target could get over 10%. But what is the ROE still under 10% when half of your company is a lot more annuity like than some of your peers referring to wealth management, asset management being half, your ROE is still under 10%. If you are to give the three main reasons why that\u2019s the case or why it should change, what would it be?","James Gorman","Well, Mike firstly I admire your consistency in coming back to this question every quarter and that\u2019s obviously something which remains a focus for us. Reason number one, not to be facetious is what our earnings are. Reason number two is, what our current capital is and reason number three is, what our ability to deploy that capital back to shareholders is has driven in large part by the CCAR process. So in short, we have a high cost problem. We\u2019re not capital or short if anything we\u2019re capital heavy. We continue to accrete capital as we have already this year significantly above what our presumed pay out and buy back plans are. So our ability to grow our ROE is both the function of improved earnings the firm is generating and the ability to right size that capital base for the business mix and model that we have. Through the first half of this year I think our ROE is running at about a 10% not including the first quarter tax gain which we had. And as we\u2019ve said publicly we believe we should be running at 10 plus percent ROE business. When we get to that point we\u2019ll layout further goals and objectives above it, but this has obviously been -- if you look back over the last four years and you strip out some of the one time whether its MBIA, whether it was Revel, or whether it was the treatment of the deferred comp, whether it was some of the big litigation with Department of Justice, FHFA, you take all of those things out. Essentially the last four years ROEs have gone from 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% pretty much in lockstep. And as I said the first half of this year we\u2019re running right on 10%, 9.1% this year quarter I think 11% in the first quarter. So, nothing more to say, nothing more to project. We\u2019re as intently focused on this as you are, but it\u2019s a function of controlling both the numerator and the denominator and the denominator is a little more complicated given the regulatory world we live in as you obviously know.","Michael Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christian Bolu","Good morning, Jon. Good morning, James.","Jonathan Pruzan","Good morning.","James Gorman","Good morning.","Christian Bolu","So, couple of questions on the longer term prospects of the Wealth Management business. So on the comp ratio, just like to get your thoughts on the competitive implications of driving the ratio below 55%. I do appreciate a lot of that is lending related, but I would imagine some of it also includes some comp rationalization. And what is the hypercompetitive environment for advisor recruitment? Does a lower comp ratio affect your ability to keep or attract high quality advisors?","James Gorman","Let me deal with that, because it\u2019s got a long term aspect which obviously we think a lot about. Firstly the reduction in the comp ratio is overwhelmingly driven by the business mix as in non-compensable for revenues and by the cost structure, non-compensation expenses that we've realized some benefits and scale coming out of the integration a couple of years ago of the Smith Barney deal. The changes to the compensation for financial advisors and support, now actually it\u2019s been very modest and -- but at the same time, I would say the recruiting environment the ins and outs has also been very modest. That is not, it might feel hypercompetitive because some of the wise run every time somebody moves from one firm to another they run a story on it, but actually in the size of these firms now the competitive environment on recruiting is really pretty stable. So that's not what's going to be the big driver here. We are not changing the compensation models for financial advisors to drive those kinds of economics. It's really business mix and it's the scalability of the business. Once you cover your fixed costs, the margins obviously improve.","Christian Bolu","Interesting. So, maybe just another question on that business and advisor growth remains weak, and you've talked about trimming the lower producing FAs. But I'd like to get your thoughts on maybe growing that business via another transformative M&A deal. A number of European banks have very sub-scale presence in the U.S., businesses that look like they could fit very well with yours. I would like to get your thoughts on maybe the appetite for in another deal and any pros and cons of doing a deal?","James Gorman","Well, Christian, I admire the question, but well obviously I wouldn't talk about deals on a call or corporate strategy like that. But suffice to say we're very conformable with business we've got and the size of the business, and we think the opportunity to improve margin with the business we have particularly by building out the bank and by organic growth within the businesses is extremely attractive to us. We had a desire to get to scale, and we are well and truly at scale. So we feel good about that.","Christian Bolu","I appreciate that. I just wanted to get maybe pros and cons of doing a deal, but I hear you. And then just -- one last question, on other revenues within ISG, could you quantify how much loan marks contributed to revenues there?","Jonathan Pruzan","No, again, I think that the primary driver was the marks on the loans in the event book, but I think that's where we will leave it.","Christian Bolu","Okay. Thank you, guys.","James Gorman","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.","Fiona Swaffield","Hi. I just had a quick question following up on the fixed income risk weighted assets. How much of the fall is due to the massive roll-down happening more quickly than expected, because I think that by the end of 2015, you were still thinking you're going to have $25 billion left to roll off. Has that changed at all?","Jonathan Pruzan","Well, I would characterize reduction in RWAs, in FIC, really a meaningful portion of that was a decrease in client activity going into and through the Greece situation. There was some passive roll off, but it was really a mix of those two things and more geared towards the risk reduction of our clients.","Fiona Swaffield","Should we still [technical difficulty].","James Gorman","Did you hear that?","Kathleen McCabe","Sorry, I think we\u2019ve lost you Fiona. Fiona?","Fiona Swaffield","Okay. Hi. Can you hear me?","Kathleen McCabe","Yes. We can hear you now.","Fiona Swaffield","I was just checking whether we should still take the 1, 5, 7 and assume the $25 billion could roll off from the end of 2015?","Jonathan Pruzan","No. I would tell you that, two things. One, we've got a stated target of $180 billion of FIC RWA in that business, we\u2019re going to clearly operate within that target. The actual quarter-to-quarter RWAs is really just going to be a function of the macro backdrop client activity and supporting our clients. So that number can move around, but we're clearly going to operate within our target.","Fiona Swaffield","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.","Steven Chubak","Hi. Good morning.","James Gorman","Good morning.","Steven Chubak","So was hoping to dig a little bit deeper into some of -- into the SLR in particular. It looks like you've reduced leverage exposure by 7% since the 1Q, \u201814 peak, so continue to make good progress there, but just given the Fed's proposal from Friday which suggested that the SLR will likely be incorporated in CCAR. I just want to get a better sense as to how much incremental SLR mitigation potential you see on the horizon especially given the backdrop for at least the planned strategy to continue to grow Morgan Stanley bank?","Jonathan Pruzan","Well, as you noted the SLR did increase from the 5.1% to the 5.3% that was a combination of both some movement in the numerator and the denominator. On the numerator we obviously had the earnings accretion for the quarter, and on the denominator, not only did the balance sheet come down, but we also made some progress on the SLR add-ons. We're clearly comfortable with that ratio where it is today. That rule doesn't go into effect until 2018. And I would tell you that we're going to continue to manage our business across all of our capital ratios and continue to remain focused on having enough capital to grow our business.","Steven Chubak","Okay. And as a follow-up to that, Jon, just thinking more broadly when you look at the current regulatory landscape and the multiple constraints that you're managing too. What do you believe longer term represents Morgan Stanley's binding constraint, and how does that inform your strategy in terms of where you see opportunities to better optimize those ratios?","Jonathan Pruzan","Well again, it's a complex question because we have multiple ratios. Clearly in terms of capital return our binding constraint is CCAR. CCAR continues to evolve quarter -- year-over-year, and we're going to continue to do our best to manage our capital ratio so we can return capital to our shareholders as well as continue to grow our business.","Steven Chubak","Okay. Thanks. And just one more for me on capital, with the Fed's proposal from Friday suggesting that the advanced approach will be deferred indefinitely in CCAR, I would appreciate if you could disclose, A; the current level of standardized RWAs, and B; how we should think about the trajectory in standardized RWA in the context of some of the mitigation targets that you've laid out in the past?","Jonathan Pruzan","In terms of the -- I think we -- I mentioned in my remarks that the advanced RWAs was about $429 billion on a preliminary basis, standardized is pretty close to that. It's about $420 billion. We've seen those numbers converge over the last several quarters. In terms of the proposal that was put out on Friday, clearly having clarity and simplification around some of the initiatives is very helpful. The delay in the SLR as you said the delay in the advanced approach as well as the removal of the Basel I test it\u2019s helpful for us and positive for 2016. We\u2019ve spend a lot of time and energy on CCAR and any time there are changes. We obviously have to go through a process and model validation and pattern recognition, and so when there are fewer changes it's easier for us just to continue running those models as we've been doing in the past. But overall I think it's too early to comment on the overall 2016 CCAR. This is A; only a proposal, and B; we haven't seen the scenarios or the final instruction. So while this has been positive because it keeps the model similar to what it was last year it's too early to comment overall on the process.","Steven Chubak","Right. Understood, Jon. I appreciate you taking my questions.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Good morning, and thanks guys. The first question, just on the expenses and your operating leverage, just looking year-over-year I think your revenues are up around 12%, expenses up 5%, the margins are around 27%, 28%. So just, when you think about going forward, in a positive revenue environment, I just wanted to get an update on some of the targets that you had for like the comp ratios by segment and probably more importantly on the non-comp side, because that's been fairly well managed, there\u2019s obviously been some volatility around legal in the past. But just when you think about areas where you're still working on efficiencies versus some incremental spend in the business, whether it's on growth or regulatory initiatives. I just wanted to get an outlook on like incremental margins in a positive revenue trending environment.","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. I think there are a couple questions there. In January, James laid out specific comp targets. They were 39% in ISG; we were at 38% for the quarter. They were 55% in Wealth Management, as I mentioned they were at 57% in the quarter. And we laid out a target of below 40% in Investment Management and its running slightly above that I think about 41%. So again, tightly managing compensation, our non-comp in terms of targets I\u2019m not sure we have specific targets, but we as I said been very focused on non-comp expenses. We've been trying to support the business growth so the level of activity will drive that number. Obviously the level of regulatory change will also drive that number, but we've been very focused on keeping a tight lid on expenses and we will continue to do that going forward.","James Gorman","And I would just add that the -- what should be obvious to everybody is these businesses are enormously scalable. Once you\u2019ve covered your fixed costs, you'd be hard pressed to grow your non-comp expenses absent legal. You\u2019d be hard pressed to grow it at the pace of what the revenues grow at in the last quarter. So we\u2019re going to keep that discipline. Obviously as Jon said, there are certain parts like brokerage and clearing, certain marketing development which do go up as revenues go up, but there's a heck of a lot of it that doesn't which gives you the incremental margin is always going to be higher than the existing margin.","Michael Carrier","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the Wealth Management business, just two things there. Just on the transaction revenues, what type of an environment would you start to see that pick up? Because it\u2019s been a couple of quarters and it hasn't been just you guys, it\u2019s been more the industry. But I just wanted to get, what do you think the big driver, the weakness there is? And then second is, just on the DOL proposal on the common period, do you think its getting ready to close. So I just wanted to get an update on your guys view on some of the challenges or the opportunities if that precedes into the back half of this year.","James Gorman","Sure. In terms of the wealth business and the transaction line, as we stated the retail investor is still somewhat on the sidelines. I think what changes that is the function of consumer confidence, whether that's acceleration of the GDP growth, whether that's rising rates, but I think we need to see some more confidence before the retail investor sort of totally reengages, so that would be on the first question. On the second question on DOL, you did highlight that the, the comment period comes to a close tomorrow. As you know that is a complicated rule and the comment period was actually extended till tomorrow, because there's been a lot of industry dialogue and a lot written on it. FINRA Chairman, Richard Ketchem recently spoke about his idea of a single standard. So to have a single standard across all products and accounts and not treat anything differently like a 401(k) or an IRA and we think that makes sense. Our clients clearly want choice, and we would support an approach that gives our ability to deliver that choice to our clients. So, we'll see where the final rule comes out.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matthew O'Connor","Good morning.","James Gorman","Good morning.","Matthew O'Connor","Most of my questions have been answered, but I had a follow-up I think I asked it last quarter. The amount of long-term debt you have coming due the next 12 months was a good disclosure and here it\u2019s showing us $27 billion. But what's the difference in the long-term debt rate that's on the balance sheet versus what you get on new issuance? Obviously rates have come down. The two notch upgrade helps. How much revenue benefit or reduction in interest expense occurs as debt rolls off and you get to reissue at a lower rate?","Jonathan Pruzan","So, a couple of things. One, you saw in the first half we did -- we issued about $23 billion, and we took advantage of some very attractive markets and we tried to frontload our issuance. So we would expect our issuance in the back half of the year to be lower. In terms of the rate or the cost of that debt, I think one way I look at it is, if you think about the WAM of our debt stack in 2010 was about five years. So if I look back at 2010 to look where we were issuing debt at that time, it was on an average of about Treasuries plus 210, so our credit spread is about 210 basis points over. That is a debt that is maturing today and our new issue -- our credit spreads today are closer to 120, so two plus 120. So we are clearly getting a benefit as our more expensive debt roll off, recognize that that roll off is not our entire debt stack. We have over $155 billion of unsecured debt, and so that benefit will accrue over time, but that's sort of a magnitude for you.","Matthew O'Connor","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","James Mitchell","Hi. Good morning. My question was pretty similar to, Matt. If you can give us sort of an update of where you are in your target of reducing funding costs by 25% in the context of the debt issuance conversation, are we close 50% of the way just so if you can give us a sense of how much more we can expect on the lower funding costs?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, I think -- I tried to answer that question when Matt asked it. I would just say, we continue to see a benefit and until we run through the entire debt stack, we\u2019re going to just keep getting that benefit over time quarter-over-quarter.","James Mitchell","But you don\u2019t want to give us like you\u2019re 50% of the way there, at 75% of the way there?","Jonathan Pruzan","Correct.","James Mitchell","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Matthew Burnell","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jon, maybe a question for you on the Wealth Management loan growth and deposit growth, now that the city transfers are effectively done, what are you expecting for deposit growth within the bank? And what are you expecting for the growth rate particularly within the retail side of the loan growth in Wealth Management? Its been running about 40% annualized, is the -- other than just the fact that the denominator is growing, is there any reason to think that, that would slow at any point over the next 6 to 12 months?","Jonathan Pruzan","Well, yes, I mean again, I\u2019ll answer that last question first. The law of large numbers, that growth rate will come down. But in terms of our FA penetration and our client penetration, it continues to improve quarter-over-quarter. I think we\u2019ve designed some very unique products for our Wealth Management clients and we\u2019ve had really good take up both on the SPL product as well as the mortgage product. And I think we feel good about the growth rates that we\u2019ve seen and our ability to penetrate our client base. So we\u2019re comfortable with the growth that we\u2019ve seen and we will continue to see. And then again I\u2019m sorry; I forgot your first question.","Matthew Burnell","Just in terms of your expectations for deposit growth now that the city transfers are done?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, as I mentioned we did see some seasonality for tax season in the deposit number this quarter. We still have significant excess liquidity that we\u2019re going to be deploying. I think Greg has mentioned some innovation we\u2019re doing around digital cash management and payment solutions, so we think that will be ultimately a good driver for growth. But right now in terms of our deposit balances we have excess deposits that we can deploy without requiring deposit balance but we\u2019re going to continue to try to penetrate our client base and grow those deposits with some new products going forward.","Matthew Burnell","Okay. And then if I can just move over to the institutional loan port -- Institutional Securities loan portfolio, that\u2019s actually growing in some cases faster than in -- than in the Wealth Management side of things. But I found it interesting that the percentage of the loans that are investor grade are also growing. Can you give us a little more color as to where you\u2019re seeing opportunities within the Institutional Securities portfolio?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. As I mentioned, we had about $2 billion of growth in the Institutional Securities balances this quarter. What we\u2019ve seen certainly in some of the M&A and event financing we\u2019ve seen a shift more towards investment grade borrowers, as we\u2019ve seen a pick up in strategic activities, so that\u2019s a driver. I would say the growth has been balanced between our products in terms of the warehouse lending facility as well as some of our other corporate products, but that shift in investment grade is really being driven by the event book.","Matthew Burnell","Okay. Thanks very much.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you.","Kathleen McCabe","Thank you everyone for your time. With that, we\u2019ll bring our second quarter earnings call to a close, and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter."],"14788":["Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Q4 2013 Earnings Conference Call January 17, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","James Gorman - Chairman and CEO","Ruth Porat - EVP and CFO","Celeste Brown - Head of IR","Analysts","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson","Celeste Brown","Good morning.

Thank you, Celeste. As we begin another year, I wanted to update you on our thoughts on the state of Morgan Stanley and where we\u2019re headed as well as provide you with a list against which you can mark us to market through 2014.","Let\u2019s walk you through the list we laid out last January and then take you deeper into some of the strategic areas in which we\u2019ve focused, in particular, those that would drive the greatest earnings in ROE upside for the firm. There are slides available on the website and then Ruth will take you through the quarterly review and together we will take questions at the end.","2013 was year of playing offense for Morgan Stanley. Outside of some of the legacy legal issues from the crisis period, our focus was moving the firm and our strategy forward and advancing down the path to meeting and beating our cost of equity. We achieved to advance a number of strategic objectives including the six to five in January of last year; specifically we acquired a 100% of the Wealth Management joint venture.","We achieved our Wealth Management margin goal through expense management and exceeded them through revenue growth. We made significant progress toward our RWA reduction goals of Fixed Income and Commodities and exceeded 2013 and our 2014 targets.","We are on track to meet our expense targets to 2014 excluding litigation. We are also on track to meet our long-term goals to growing earnings through Morgan Stanley specific growth opportunities. And finally we\u2019ve made progress towards returns to meet and exceed the cost of capital, excluding litigation and we began our first buyback since 2008 in the middle of last year.","Like all of our peers we have litigation exposure which is laid out in extensive detail in our filings. In addition to the higher legal expenses we incurred in the first three quarters of 2013, we took a charge of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Obviously we cannot predict the future. But we believe this move represent significant progress towards putting these matters behind us.","The steps we will outline for you today are a continuation of what we discussed a year-ago and consistent with the strategy that this management team put in place four years ago. We had six strategic focus areas and again you can follow along with the slides on our website.","We will achieve our goals in a prudent manner without taking outside risks and taking consideration the need of all of our stakeholders. Number one, continue to drive Wealth Management through margin goals and higher cost -- improved cost initiatives from revenue growth.","In mid 2013 we increased our margin targets to 20% to 22% by the end of 2015, driven by the upside from earning a 100% of the Wealth Management business. We reach the bottom of that range in the fourth quarter excluding the impairment driven by partial connection of the benefits of only a 100% as well as higher markets. Based on where the S&P closed 2013 and our expectation for deposit deployment, we are now raising our target for year-end 2015 to 22% to 25% even without the benefit of higher rates.","Second, Fixed Income and Commodities. We have a threefold plan to drive our returns to greater than our cost of equity in Fixed Income and Commodities. Number one; optimize the Commodities business by reducing our exposure of physical commodities. Number two, improve the efficiency in ROE of our other Fixed Income businesses through centralized or federalized management of resources. And number three continue to reduce risk weighted assets.","In regards to Commodities, we announced late last year that we are selling our global physical oil business. This will be done in two parts. The first is the transaction we announced for the Rosneft, which included the sale of our oil merchanting business. The second component is our intention to expose strategic options for our stake in TransMontaigne, which is a separate discrete entity that provides a wide variety of distribution and storage services for oil related products in North America. We believe we can generate an acceptable ROE with the remaining Commodities business, which is also more consistent with our client base across sales and trading.","Outside of Commodities we have philosophically changed the way we run Fixed Income from a highly segregated to a highly federalized model with a more strategic approach to resource allocation division wide and a particular focus on expenses, technology, capital and balance sheet. We have achieved normalized ROEs around or above that cost of capital in almost all product areas, except for rates. We are aligning our approach in rates to be more consistent with that of the rest of Fixed Income with the leadership team that has a heightened focus on balance sheet utilization and high velocity.","Finally, we have moved forward our Fixed Income and Commodities, RWA target by one year. Previously our target was to reach the 180 billion RWA level by the end of 2016. Now we expect to reach that level by the end of 2015.","Third area was expenses. Let me update you on where we are versus the targets we set out a year-ago. We said that assuming flat revenue our expenses will be down $1.6 billion by the end of 2014, which implied an expense ratio then of 79%. Of course our revenues grew in 2013 and we\u2019re on track to meet or beat the 79% expense ratio implied by the $1.6 billion target, assuming revenues in 2014 are higher or in line with 2013 and excluding litigation above 2012 levels. Because we expect revenue to continue to grow in 2014 and beyond, we will focus our discussion in the future on these ratios.","Our target expense ratio for 2014 and beyond is less than 79%, assuming flat or higher revenues and excluding legal expenses again above the 2012 levels. Marking the market 2013 our expenses were up for several reasons. First, we had expenses that are not likely to recur in 2014 including several write-offs in Wealth Management. Second, we along with the industry experienced elevated legal expenses. Adjusting for those two factors, our expense base in 2013 would have been $26.1 billion reflecting a 79% expense ratio.","Additionally, revenue grew 9% during the year and we thus experienced growth in activity relating expenses to those revenues including compensation, brokerage and clearing. Excluding activity-based expenses, our fully adjusted expense base in 2013 would have been $24.5 billion, more than half way through the reductions we discussed with you a year-ago.","Let me now turn to the fourth topic, which is Morgan Stanley specific growth opportunities and most notably in the bank. We spend a great deal of time in the last year introducing you to the upside associated with the bank. And in the deck you have on slide 11, we\u2019ve laid out the upside very clearly.","Revenue growth in our bank will be driven by three tailwinds, including growth in the deposit base and associated assets, the optimization of these assets, moving cash into AFS and lending and finally upside from higher rates. The significant revenue growth will flow through Wealth Management and Institutional Services with exceptionally high incremental margins well above the margins we are generating today as we have already made the infrastructure investment.","By the end of 2015, we expect to have an asset base of approximately $160 billion. Based on current market rates and our expected asset mix at the end of 2015, the blended yield would be 1.8%. If we substitute the yields indicated by the forward curve on the same asset base, the average yield would then be 2.7%.","The fifth topic is of course the return of capital to shareholders. We intend to prudently increase our return of capital to shareholders over time subject to of course the regulatory approval, increasing both our share buyback program and our dividends reflecting greater percent of our revenue and earnings coming from more stable businesses. The key driver of increased return to shareholders over time are our increasingly consistent earnings, our strong capital ratios and finally our strategy that is consistent with the evolving regulatory requirements.","Finally, the sixth point which is of course our ROE returns. Our focus is to drive higher returns to shareholders through sustainably improving our ROE to levels equal to or in excess of our cost of equity even without a cyclical recovery. Assuming no improvement in the institution and retail market, normalized litigation expenses, execution of our bank strategy and expense initiatives, a strategic solution for physical commodities and centralized Fixed Income as well as Wealth Management margin improvement, we believe we can reach ROEs above 9% and ROTs of 10%. Then assuming excess capital will get us to or above 10% levels on ROE and 11% on ROT. Of course an improved operating environment would drive those numbers further.","I will now turn it over to Ruth, to walk you through the fourth quarter results. Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Good morning. I\u2019ll provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the foot notes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures. The impact of DVA in the quarter was negative $368 million with $285 million in Fixed Income, sales and trading and $83 million in equity sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were $8.2 billion, up 1% versus the third quarter.","Earnings and earnings per share included $1.2 billion or $0.40 per share of legal expenses. The effective tax rate from containing operations for the fourth quarter reflects an overall benefit of $328 million including a discrete benefit of $192 million. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders excluding DVA were approximately $384 million.","Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share excluding DVA were $0.20 after preferred dividends.","On a GAAP basis, including the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues for the quarter were 7.8 billion. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were 144 million. GAAP results also included 1.2 billion or $0.40 per share of legal expenses. Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.07 after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was $32.29 per share and tangible book value was $27.21 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were 832 billion at December 31. Deposits as of quarter end were 112 billion, up 8 billion versus 3Q. Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was 202 billion compared with 198 billion at the end of the third quarter.","Turning to capital, although our calculations are not final, we believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I will be approximately 12.8% and our Tier 1 capital ratio will be approximately 15.7%.","Risk-weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately 389 billion at December 31. Reflecting our best estimate of the final Federal Reserve rules, our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was 10.5% at December 31. Pro forma risk-weighted assets under Basel III are estimated to be 428 billion.","Our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was negatively affected by approximately 50 basis points due to an increase in our operational risk RWAs, which resulted from higher legal costs in the quarter. This was partially offset by earnings accretion and the ongoing reduction in Fixed Income RWAs.","We expect our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio to be approximately 4.2%. This estimate reflects the United States proposed regulatory rules for the numerator and the denominator and is subject to change is rules evolve. We continue to expect to exceed the required 5% level in 2015 including an assumption for increasing returns of capital to shareholders.","On Slide 14 of our strategy deck, we have outlined the drivers of our path to an SLR of greater than 5% in 2015. Forces within our control include exposure compression and RWA reductions, earnings accretion and other numerator drivers including DTA reductions, increased investment capacity, preferred issuance and other reduced numerator deductions, which in aggregate could drive approximately 180 basis points to 210 basis points of improvement in our ratio. Potential offsets include balance sheet growth and capital returns.","Turning to expenses, total expenses this quarter were 7.9 billion, up 20% versus the third quarter but up 1% excluding the legal item I noted. Compensation expense was essentially flat to the prior quarter. Non-compensation expense was 3.9 billion reflecting higher legal costs.","Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In institutional securities, revenues excluding DVA were 3.7 billion, down 4% sequentially. Non-interest expense was 4.4 billion, up 34% versus the third quarter. Compensation was 1.6 billion for the fourth quarter, down 4% versus the third quarter, reflecting a 42% ratio excluding DVA.","Non-compensation expense of 2.9 billion reflects the elevated legal expenses due to settlements and additions to reserves related to legacy, residential, mortgage-backed securities matters associated with the credit crisis. The business reported a pre-tax loss of 745 million excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact of DVA to pre-tax loss was 1.1 billion.","In investment banking, revenues of 1.4 billion were up 37% versus last quarter. Results were driven by increased revenues in all products; equity underwriting, advisory and Fixed Income underwriting. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked #3 in global announced and completed M&A, global IPOs and global equity at the end of the fourth quarter.","Notable transactions included in advisory, Morgan Stanley is a leader in cross-border activity with transactions including Portugal Telecom's 15.7 billion merger with Oi SA which represented the largest M&A announced deal for the quarter as well as Perrigo's 8.6 billion acquisition of Elan.","In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as the advisor to Crown Castle International as lead left book runner and stabilization agent on common and mandatory offering while also acting as lead left book runner on the 3.4 billion senior unsecured committed bridge facility.","In debt underwriting, event related financings included Morgan Stanley acting as lead left book runner on Devon Energy's 2.3 billion debt offering in support of the company's acquisition of GeoSouthern Energy's Eagle Ford assets.","Advisory revenues of 451 million were up 64% versus our third quarter results, driven by increased revenues across regions. Equity underwriting revenues of 416 million were up 76% versus the third quarter, also driven by increases across regions, in particular in Europe as well as a significant increase in IPO volumes.","Fixed Income underwriting revenues were 495 million, up 3% versus the third quarter driven by loan syndication fees partially offset by decreases in investment grade underwriting.","Equity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were 1.5 billion, a decrease of 12% from last quarter. Results were strong for our fourth quarter with robust client activity across regions and products. Cash equity revenues increased driven by higher volumes in most major markets. Derivatives, revenues remained healthy although declined from a strong 3Q '13.","Prime brokerage revenues and balances were up in 4Q and were the highest since 2008. Fixed Income and Commodity sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were 694 million. Commodities revenues were meaningfully lower in a difficult market. Revenues outside of Commodities were up slightly sequentially, despite a larger sequential drag from CVA.","Revenues were driven by increases in credit, foreign exchange and securitized products partially offset by lower results and rates. Client volumes held up relatively well across businesses in the fourth quarter though remained subdued in line with the industry.","Investment revenues of 177 million were down versus the third quarter which included the sale of the insurance broker hub. Average trading bar for the fourth quarter was 51 million, essentially flat to the third quarter.","Turning to Wealth Management, revenues were 3.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Asset management revenues of 2 billion were up versus last quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher market levels at the beginning of the quarter and positive flows.","Transaction revenues increased 10% from last quarter consisting primarily of commissions of 576 million, which were up 14% versus the prior quarter, due to a pick up across products. Investment banking related fees of 206 million, up 11% versus the last quarter, reflecting an increase in equity underwriting activity, and trading revenues of 323 million, up 2% versus the third quarter reflecting higher deferred compensation plans.","Net interest revenue increased 7% to 528 million, driven primarily by higher revenues from our bank deposit program and continued growth in our lending product. Other revenue increased to 110 million from 75 million. Non-interest expense was 3 billion, up versus last quarter. The compensation ratio is 58%, flat versus the third quarter, non-compensation expense was 876 million, up 10% versus last quarter, due to an impairment charge as well as the typical seasonal increase in expenses.","The PVT margin was 19% and was 20% excluding the impairment charge. Profit before tax was 709 million. Total client assets were up versus the third quarter to 1.9 trillion. Global fee-based asset inflows were 12 billion. Fee-based assets under management increased to 697 billion at quarter end, representing 37% of AUM.","Global representative were 16,456, essentially flat to the third quarter. Bank deposits were 134 billion, up versus the third quarter, approximately 104 billion were held in Morgan Stanley banks.","Investment management, revenues of 842 million were up 2% from the third quarter. In traditional asset management, revenues of 430 million were up 17% from the third quarter, driven by higher market levels. In real estate investing, revenues of $160 million were down 31% driven by a decline in carry as last quarter we had a significant benefit from carry catch up. Merchant banking revenues were $252 million up 12% reflecting increased deferred compensation plans as well as higher investment gains from an IPL of an existing private equity investment. Expenses were $505 million down 4% from the third quarter. Profit before tax was $337 million up 12% sequentially. NCI was $46 million versus $64 million last quarter. Total assets under management increased to $373 billion driven by market depreciation.","As to our outlook, in investment banking the momentum evident in the fourth quarter persists as we enter 2014. In particular the M&A pipeline continues to build on the back of improving global economies. The drivers evident in 2013 remain in the cross border transaction, financial sponsors and activists. We expect further upside from one to pick up in corporate existing from sponsor, buyers as well as to the uptick in activity in EMEA after very muted levels for the last several years. The outlook for equity underwriting in 2014 remains healthy especially relative to the low volumes in EMEA and Asia experienced in 2013. Trading volumes and client activity across sales and trading are beginning to reflect confidence in global growth.","In Wealth Management our outlook for 2014 is similarly constructive given higher markets, lending growth and ongoing improvements in retail investor engagement. Our revised PBT margin targets helped to quantify the upside we see in this business. Finally we would expect return on equity to further benefit from an increasing capital returns upon completion of the CCAR process at the end of Q1.","Thank you for listening and James and I will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Thank you. Within your plans for Fixed Income I was wondering if you could elaborate on how we get the ROE up in rates and isn\u2019t an ROE focus as opposed to a revenue focus? I\u2019d appreciate that.","Ruth Porat","So the focus is an ROE focus as opposed to a revenue focus. And as we indicated we have a number of areas that are driving the overall ROE higher. First and foremost we talked about Commodities and the steps that we\u2019re taking in Commodities. We are selling two physical oil businesses there, the first one as we\u2019ve talked about; we have announced the sale to Rosneft. In December we expect it to close in the second half of \u201914. The PBT in that business is essentially breakeven and it has about $4 billion risk weighted assets, so accretive to returns there. With respect to the second business TransMontaigne we\u2019ll share more when we have something to say on that. With respect to moving to centralize -- the move to centralized management we have a very systematic and clinical approach really to optimizing returns within each of our businesses. It\u2019s a focus on revenues, expenses and capital and we\u2019re continuing to balance those to drive returns and rates as we have in other businesses across the platform.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Rates right now is still the biggest revenue piece of FICC I take it?","Ruth Porat","As I said we\u2019re really focused on the overall returns in the business and we\u2019re looking at within each of the product areas revenues, optimizing revenues, expenses and capital and so we\u2019ve really driven returns within the FICC across products to levels on a normalized basis that are at or above cost to capital. We in fact made significant improvement in foreign exchange this year, this past year and are at this point operating with returns basically in line with our cost of capital when you look at RWA\u2019s on a normalized basis, so the next one to add here with the same approach is rates.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay, cool. Speaking of RWA, hopefully I did the math right and I think Basel III RWA was up 3.5% almost quarter-on-quarter and I\u2019m just curious because I know the overall focus is down in Fixed Income and down overall. Was there anything particular that drove that this quarter because I know the direction is going the other way?","Ruth Porat","So you\u2019re right. We have been reducing risk weighted assets within Fixed Income but the reason there\u2019s an addition here is a key component of the calculation is ops risk that captures litigation. And so with the higher reserve here in the fourth quarter that would change the overall calculation of the ops risk capital charge, so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","A question on that Ruth is, if that happen in the quarter that you realized higher legal costs or is that a permanent addition that kind of sticks through the process until further notice?","Ruth Porat","So the way it works is, with the addition of a sizable data point within the overall distribution of data points you have to calculate ops risk. Once you add a more sizable data point as we did here, data in the tail would affect the overall calculation. Smaller pieces kind of in the belly of the distribution don\u2019t actually have an impact on the capital charge and once it is in the dataset it remains in the dataset until you see a change in the distribution, so it is in there for some time.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Got you. I guess I mean if James is right on his comment of putting most of the stuff to bed, and maybe within a years time you start to get the benefit of that I know the CCAR process moves slow. Last one, Wealth Management loans and commitments were up another 10% this quarter or up almost 50% year-on-year, I guess there is the PLA component and all the securities based stuff and then the mortgage part. I don\u2019t know if you can share with us which one of those is growing and of the overall pie how important is it to Wealth Management in general because I know it comes on a different comp grid.","Ruth Porat","So overall loan growth is important to Morgan Stanley across businesses; we\u2019re having deployments supporting growth in institutional securities as well as Wealth Management and in fact on the ROE walk it's the most important incremental driver to returns. But to your quarter with respect to Wealth Management what you\u2019re seeing is the benefit of the growing deposits that are asset optimization and then what that translates into. Growth is across both PLA or the securities based lending product and residential mortgage. There\u2019s more of it in PLA, although I would say in the mortgage side we\u2019ve continued to see strong demand. Historically we were deliberately constraining production there because we were both focused on client experience and in fact applications were up in the quarter. But the bigger part of the growth has been PLA. And again what we\u2019re benefiting from here as we\u2019ve talked about on prior calls is we\u2019re under-penetrated relative to our peers, this is very logical consistent product for them.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay. Thanks Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Good morning.","James Gorman","Good morning.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Just a quick question on the SLR first of all; did you have a chance to think about what the impact of the final BIS add-ons that were announced last weekend would be?","Ruth Porat","We have been working through that, it's a complex calculation in particular with respect to the net long CDS sold portion of it is as you know well. Our preliminary calculation is we are approaching 4% on that basis well above the 3% required.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Great, that\u2019s helpful. You talked about a number of drivers to get the SLR on the NPR basis up to the 5%. Can you talk a little bit about what the implications might be of some of those moves for revenue and I guess that\u2019s where maybe it gets into the overlap with what you\u2019re doing on the rate side?","Ruth Porat","Well the path to greater than 5% in 2015 and again that\u2019s including an assumption about increasing returns of capital as I just break them down into the numerator and denominator. In the numerator not only do we benefit from earnings accretion, but there is a multiplier effect because of certain deductions most notably DTA and the investment capacity deduction. The investment capacity is based on the size of Tier 1 capital so certainly as Tier 1 capital increases you have a larger basket smaller deduction of holding capital against certain items that fall into that basket amount like our joint venture in MUMSS at each end of the bucket. So when the bucket gets bigger there are fewer deductions. And then there are specific steps that we can take to focus, and that we are taking to focus on items that are captured in the investment bucket. So I would think of it, its earnings accretions and a multiplier impact on that for the reasons that I just described. And when it's being efficient with some of those numerator deductions that\u2019s not a -- that doesn\u2019t have an impact on revenue. Preferred obviously also adds to the numerator. You can do \u2013 so the dividends, you could say, would be the deduct, but it adds to the overall Tier 1 capital and as well to therefore the investment bucket. In the denominator, we continue to have a benefit from the RWA rundown and as we've talked about, that's in areas that are not accretive to revenue. And I'd say the other one that is important is compression. And I would put that in the bucket of just good hygiene. So we've invested quite a bit in central clearing, back loading into central clearing. It gives us great opportunity for compression. We're seeing more interest in that from banks on both sides of the Atlantic, and again that's just in the category of good hygiene. So I think that we're very comfortable with the implications of this, the various levers we have to move up to the greater than 5%.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","So it doesn\u2019t sound like you loaded into that a lot of the strategic changes that you might be making in rates? For example, maybe changing the way you look at repo or anything like that?","Ruth Porat","No. And the assumption on \u2013 that's embedded in this slide is consensus earnings, but I'd say that the other items that I enumerated are quite very important and no, there isn't enough change in the assumption on some of the other items.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Got it. Is there a new sort of breakeven level of thick revenues that you need to achieve to get to that ROE equal to your cost of equity, and when I say breakeven I mean specifically, a level of revenue that you would be given your cost base in order to get the whole FICC business to earning at cost of equity? I think in the past you've talked about 6 billion or so and I just wondered if its lower?","Ruth Porat","So let me answer that by pointing you back, for example, to Commodities. We've talked about the thing we are clinically focused on is driving returns higher in that business. And to your question you focused on one of the three levers, it's revenues, it's expenses and it's capital optimization. So as I indicated, with the business that is being sold throughout and after this point, it is essentially PVT breakeven from Morgan Stanley. It has about 4 billion of risk-weighted assets in it, so yes, there may be a diminution in revenues there but when you look at the cost structure running that type of business within BHC, it's more valuable in the hands of an investor or player. We have higher capital liquidity levels associated with the business and that's why we say what we're looking at is ROE. That is smart move for us, for the business, for our stakeholders, it's accretive to ROE although there are some revenues that go with it.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Got it, that's helpful. One of our big competitors took a large charge for FVA as they adopted that approach on their derivatives book. Is there \u2013 maybe you can tell us whether you currently do that or not and whether that's something that you're contemplating?","Ruth Porat","So that obviously refers to the potential implied financing costs around collateralized derivatives to the extent that those are observable. We do continue to evaluate it. There has been a lot of industry discussion around FBA. In our view, transparency has been lacking and today in our opinion there is not a basis to take the adjustment. From a risk management perspective, we do allocate capital and liquidity down to the product in debt level across our sales and trading businesses, so liquidity is allocated based on our liquidity funding model which models outflows in a stressed environment, and those are as I said allocated down to the product level. So from a risk management perspective, the businesses are being charged appropriately. That is different from seeing transparency in the marketplace.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Got it. Last one from me, you mentioned FX and having achieved some success there in terms of getting the returns to where you want it to be. I did notice that in the quarter, your FX bar is up a significant percentage of where it was before. Does that reflect changes in the business or just market volatility?","Ruth Porat","No, the FX flows up quarter-over-quarter and it just reflects plan activity.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Got it. Thank you very much.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Good morning. So within ISG, was there a shift this year to less deferrals and would that maybe have put a little bit of upward pressure on your GAAP comp expense figure, just trying to maybe think about that even if we don't get specific numbers just from an area of perspective?","Ruth Porat","So the ISG comp ratio, I think you have this, is down from 45% to 42% this year. We did bring down the deferral rate as we indicated we would, so the deferral rate has come down. And when you think about our comp ratio on a go-forward basis, our view is that it will trend down to about that 40% range.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. But with deferrals coming out that would have put all else being equal even with the comp ratio coming down, some upward pressure on that ratio. Isn't that the right way to think about it?","Ruth Porat","Yes.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay, great. And then thinking about a dividend that you guys sort of introduced in Slide 13, if you think back to 4Q trailing GAAP earnings when you guys submitted a CCAR which clearly includes some headwinds but in any event, we know that the Fed sort of looks at that. Very simplistically we just apply a 30% payout ratio to that, it would imply a $0.50 dividend per year. Any issue with the math on that? You think that people are thinking about it that way would be too aggressive?","Ruth Porat","Let me answer it this way. Our view is that the way to maximize return of capital over the longer term is to request steady consistent increases in capital returns in the interim as opposed to any type of discontinuous move. So given the ongoing accretion to capital and the higher ratios at Morgan Stanley, we think now it's the right time to increase the size of our share repurchase program and begin to increase the dividend. But I'd start it with our philosophy because I think it's an important way to frame how we think about legging in to any kind of change.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay, that's helpful. And as we think about Wealth Management and you guys have had terrific momentum there clearly, and your outlook for improvement there and kind of with engagement continuing to improve, do you expect that that would increase the fee rates that you guys get on your managed assets? That had been under a little bit of pressure recently and it's sort of at lower levels. Does that reflect a lower level of engagement and does your expectation for increased engagement mean that that probably should, all else equal, have some upward pressure there?","Ruth Porat","No\u2026","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. I'm sorry, go ahead.","Ruth Porat","It's asset mix but no, that was an improvement.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. And then last one, you guys are looking for like a near doubling of the loan book as you laid out in the slide deck from now until 2015. How much of that doubling should we count on from Wealth Management versus institutional? And as we watch the disclosures that you guys gave in the supplement, is it mostly in the health or investment volumes that we should be watching?","Ruth Porat","I think you have a couple of questions in there. We've laid out the asset growth by product and I discussed it in a conference earlier in the year. The loan growth overall is supporting both, as I said, product and Wealth Management as well as institutional securities. So we talked already about mortgage and PLA within Wealth Management. In institutional securities, the product is similarly very consistent with our client franchise where we have strong domain expertise areas like commercial real estate, project finance, continuing to expand with our clients. It is primarily HFI. We've really migrated to HFI over the last several years and we see this as prudent, steady growth across a suite of products to support growth in those two businesses. We've laid out the products and the deck that James went though, so you can get a sense of the suite of products on both sides.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay, thanks for the color, Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi. I think you said the margin ROE targets do not reflect a change in interest rates, so what is Morgan Stanley sensitivity to higher interest rates, for example, or a 100 basis point increase in Fed funds?","Ruth Porat","We gave two targets and let me make sure we're very clear. When we focus on increasing the PVT margin in Wealth Management, we kept it on a basis consistent with the way we described it last year. So last year we had a Wealth Management target of 20% to 22%. We said we were holding rates and equity markets constant. And so as we hit our 20% PVT margin this quarter, excluding the impairments of 20% PBT margin. We took our guidance up for Wealth Management and that again is holding rates constant. We don\u2019t give ourselves the benefit of even the forward yield curve. It's holding rates where they are today and holding equity markets where they are today. If we now switch over to our ROE walk and look at the upside that comes from the bank with respect to the upside in the bank and the slides that looks at asset optimization and the yield on the various categories, in that we have embedded the forward yield curve and nothing more than the forward yield curve. So we try to give you a lot of the pieces with respect to asset growth and the mix and that assumption so that you can do all the sensitivities that you think are appropriate given your outlook on the market.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","So if you did have a 100 basis point increase in fed funds then we could assume a higher PBT for the Wealth Management business?","Ruth Porat","Yes, so rates obviously our benefit to the bank overall and to the Wealth Management business.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","You mentioned prime brokerage is back to that level since 2008, is it all the way back. I know the business was hurt during the crises and you trying to get customers back; are you back at a steady state or you\u2019re still gaining share?","Ruth Porat","We\u2019re in a very strong business with PV and I would say that they has been a quite substantial change overall in prime brokerage over the last several years a restructuring of that business and the way the business is funded post to \u201908 it's, so we\u2019re in a strong position with balances, I think that\u2019s reflecting the strength of it and the overall contribution of the franchise. So we feel very good about where we\u2019re in the business, very important business to us and we\u2019re \u2013 the team continues to deliver.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","In FICC compared to your peers, it looks like you underperformed and it's tough to breakout how much of that underperformance is due to the deliberate downsizing versus poor execution, I mean are you satisfied with the execution this quarter or not?","Ruth Porat","So a couple of parts to that question as well. As a reminder Fixed Income and Commodity is made up of the Fixed Income product and Commodities, two separate \u2013 two different businesses that on the one hand Commodities on the other, we were substantially weaker in Commodities down meaningfully quarter-over-quarter. The thick revenues excluding Commodities are up quarter-over-quarter not withstanding the bigger drag in CVA due to spread tightening. So in our securitized products area in credit and foreign exchange they were all up in the quarter. So to your second part of your question I feel good about the direction of those businesses, rates was down as with the market and our view is that we can continue to do to deliver more in that business which is why it was highlighted in James\u2019s comments.","James Gorman","I would just add to that Mike. I wouldn\u2019t draw a lot on percentage movements off of that number which is a fairly modest number to begin with to be perfectly frank. So I would focus more on the business mix as Ruth described, part of the business did well, parts of it didn\u2019t. The new management has a plan to drive this higher and we come from where they plan.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And then last question, Ameritrade last quarter said that the wire houses have made some moves which may get more difficult on the breakaway broker side, and I am not exactly sure what the online broker was referring to. But can you just address what you\u2019re doing say to either retain customers or brokers or how the environments changed from several years ago say for example against online brokers or other competitors? Thanks.","Ruth Porat","Well attrition in our business you can see from the headcount numbers, it continue to be very low. It's actually down a bit this quarter from the very low levels that we\u2019ve been talking about and we think that has a lot to do with the quality of the platform and when you look at our ongoing growth in assets you\u2019re reaching 1.9 trillion this quarter I think again the clients are speaking and FA\u2019s are speaking.","James Gorman","It's a different market segment.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question will come from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Maybe for James, just on the walk the ROE target, I guess I am just trying to figure out when I look at the pre tax margin being increased. The risk weighted asset reduction coming on sooner, expenses in line, the market up 30%, but the ROE target is still in that 9% to 10% plus range if we get a better environment too. I guess I am just trying to figure out it seems like it should be better I mean it seems like things have gone better than current expectations or what the expectations were a year ago. So anyways I am just trying to get a sense on, has some things gone the other way to keep the ROE target there or is it just being conservative.","James Gorman","Listen, this is a journey. Three years ago I think our ROE was close to 2%, two years ago it was about 5%; this year exited litigation is about 7%. You\u2019ll see on that chart Mike that we\u2019ve got return target of 10 plus percent and then we talk about the additional upside, so you control your own conclusions from that. But I think we\u2019ve said pretty consistently we were a kind of one step at a time management team. The one step is to get us to 10% and we\u2019ll do what that happy opportunity once we get there, so lets just play it out at a time.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks. And just as a follow up; based on giving more clarity around broker, I mean you guys have been probably more strategic in terms of moving forward in FICC, there maybe some other problems but, in any other areas in particularly investment management maybe unlike the merchant banking side are things fairly much set or should we be expecting much more to change in that part of the business based on what you know on the broker side as of now?","James Gorman","I don\u2019t expect material changes for the investment management business plus broker, I mean we had a lot more capital tied up in that business pre-crises. The bad news is we wrote a lot it off unfortunately, the good news is we now had much of those capital tied up in the business.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question will come from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Hi, good morning; thanks for taking my questions. So I just want to try to ask maybe the interest rate sensitivity question another way. I think the last formal update that we received was that a 100 basis point curve shift would increase net interest income by about $700 million. So is that still the firms view and if that\u2019s still in the range; can you give us any insight around how you\u2019re thinking about the viability side of the equation meaning how much of the benefit of the rate increase do you expect you have to pass along to customers?","Ruth Porat","So the rates have moved up a bit since we provided that guidance, and that\u2019s why we attempted in the material here and in the slide deck to break out the various component parts of it. You can apply whatever timeline you want to it and look at it at various points sometime, and so clearly in rising rate environment there would be some, be it mostly higher increase in deposit costs as well, but overall we have meaningful operating leverage from this. I think again one of the key points for us with respect to the bank is the cost structure of the bank. We don\u2019t have client acquisition cost because we\u2019re talking about our embedded client base both on the Wealth Management side and on the institutional security side. We don\u2019t have bricks and mortar. We have made the investments, fruitfully all of the investments that needed we continue to invest in the businesses of course in particular to continue to improve the customer experience. But as a result the incremental margin on this product is very high for Morgan Stanley, substantially higher than it is today and it's not just -- that we\u2019ve clearly benefited from a rising rate environment and look forward to that whenever that may occur, but it's also the cost structure of that business that is very different.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Okay, I appreciate that color. And then, just with respect to the litigation expense, how should we think about that moving forward. I know it's going to be lumpy, but can we think that maybe some of the outsized provision this quarter could reflect some pull forward from issues that maybe were thinking that were going to be addressed next year; just any other additional color there would be helpful.","Ruth Porat","Well as James said this reserve coupled with the reserves to date are appropriate based on what we now know and that being said litigation is the biggest headway for the industry, but this is obviously a substantial move.","James Gorman","The key on the litigation is, we wanted to make significant progress. It's estimable and probable and working with our legal team and finance and some that\u2019s where we came out. So from what we see we made significant progress.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Okay, great. And then, just lastly within the investment banking backlog; can you guys give anymore granularity around what you\u2019re seeing and just kind of the businesses from a cyclical perspective kind of where you are today versus maybe what you think the upside maybe as we do get a cyclical recovery?","Ruth Porat","So the pipeline does remain strong. I think most gratifying is the pick up in M&A momentum coming from CO confidence that we\u2019ve all been looking for, for quite some time now and it's really on the back of more data that supports the thesis of global economic growth. We are seeing more cross-border activity. We've talked about that on some prior calls. The Century deal that we announced early this week is yet another data point in that trend. We think that's an important one. I did comment that we're seeing more activity with corporate. I think last year much of it was much more about financial sponsor activity but now we're also seeing more corporate activity. And very valuable is increased participation from Europe as well, have pretty subdued there for quite some time. We feel good about where this is and if you look historically, M&A still at pretty low levels. Equity underwriting momentum continues industry wide and globally and I think with debt underwriting, it's less of forward calendar, but given debt related financings, expect some ongoing strength in that area as well.","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Great. Appreciate all the color.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Good morning. As we think about the ROE progression from roughly 7% ex the litigations and the noise right now to the 9%, it seems like the improvement in PVT is worth about 1% to ROE. And then the FICC and the commodity is a big driver. Can you quantify how much ROE upside there is from that? And I understand there's been a lot of questions asked what the revenue opportunities, the expense opportunities and there's constant some moving pieces there. But from an ROE point of view if you get FICC and Commodities where you want it, how much of a driver is that to firm-wide ROE?","Ruth Porat","What I'd like to add to it because it's the most important incremental driver to ROE is the bank. I've commented on higher yield to asset optimization and the cost structure we have. We also have growing deposits and those are contractual. It's part of the acquisition from Citi that we're now getting in 1.75 billion of deposits per month to the middle of next year. So the result is a higher return on a larger base and given the cost structure, the incremental margin is substantial as I've already noted, so essentially just all drops to the bottom line. You start with that. I'll let you do your own forecasting and map on that plus the Wealth Management, higher profitability that we laid out here on this slide. And Fixed Income, yes, we are talking steps. We are moving it forward but we're not assuming a recovery in the FICC market, so that's not the biggest driver, not much there. And then we have more on the expense reduction program to come in, as James says, and finally the increasing returns of capital over time. So I just want to make sure you've got the full list. And again the importance of the bank is not to be understated.","James Gorman","I would just add at a sort of macro level if you think about it simplistically, comp to revenue ratios aren't going to change a whole lot, certainly going to be \u2013 we broke them down this year given revenues went up and we would expect them to come down as revenues go up. So that's kind of known. The firm is being managed very tightly from other non-comp expense basis. We have a comprehensive worldwide effort, as Ruth just referred to, making progress on that. And we're not going to take our foot off that. We're going to be driving those non-comps very aggressively. So it's really just the question what the revenues are. I think the clarity of our expense base is probably as high as it's been for a long time. And now, as we said with this substantial progress on the litigation behind us, it really is a revenue show right now.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","And just a follow-up on the expenses, sorry if I missed it but of the 1.6 billion of savings, how much is in the run rate either for the full year 2013 or 4Q?","Ruth Porat","I'll refer you to the slides that James went through where we tried to break out the key components of it.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Good morning, James. Good morning, Ruth. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on an earlier question on the 100% growth you expect in lend-in. Just be helpful to get some color on where you're seeing such robust loan demand? Is it completely new loan demand from your clients or is it your clients switching from existing lending providers to you? And what is it about your lending program that is driving such outsized growth relative to the industry?","Ruth Porat","If I break it down into the two sides of the business that are benefiting most from deposits. First, on the Wealth Management side; lending to clients where we have the deep relationship. Their assets are here at Morgan Stanley. And what we have talked about is we're underpenetrated relative to peers with lending product had not historically been a focus for our system. And over the last several years, we've been building up the number of bank advisors who sit with financial advisors providing the requisite support for their client base. So we're starting in a position where we're underpenetrated, have the client assets with us. This is product the clients want. It's simple products. For example, PLA our securities and base lending program enables clients to maintain their portfolio as is, but continued to invest as they wanted. So it's a very productive add on to the work that they're already doing with us. And again, given this is product that's significantly over-collateralized and as I've said with our existing client base, we've had virtually no credit losses to-date. It's mostly floating rate product and you're seeing growth \u2013 we're seeing nice growth in that. It's the bigger part of lending growth within Wealth Management and I'll refer you back to the conference I did earlier in the year where there's more detail on that one. In the mortgage side, we are continuing to see strong demand. To be fair, it's off of a low base but we were deliberately constraining production there, as I already noted, so continuing to see upside in that business. If you switch over to the institutional security side, we have historically been focused on relationship lending and event lending, if you were to expect, and what we're now adding our \u2013 well, I always characterize it like sleeves of product, all modestly sized that are consistent with the client franchise that we have. So this is business that otherwise we were not doing with our existing client franchise. This gives us the opportunity to continue to delve and that's what we've been doing in areas like commercial, real estate and project finance.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks for the detailed answer.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Just switching over the capital return, I can see that quantum of capital Morgan Stanley can return would be subject to regulatory approval. But as you consider the future's capital structure of Morgan Stanley, do you envisage being able to return more than a 100% of earnings to shareholders in the foreseeable future?","James Gorman","Listen, I think let's take one step at a time. We're in the CCAR process now. We had our first capital outlay last year which was the final acquisitions of Smith Barney. We had our first buyback last year since 2008 which was starting the $500 million tranche. We're participating in CCAR right now. We'll get the results of that in the first quarter. Let's just take our projections from then on.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Okay. Apologies if I missed this earlier on. But with regards to your 9% ROE target what Fixed Income revenue assumption are you making? Is it kind of 4.2 billion you did this year or is it more like fourth quarter's run rate? Just trying to get a sense of what's embedded in that 9% ROE target?","Ruth Porat","The main point, as I said, about the 9% ROE starting point for the firm is that within Fixed Income we are driving a return on capital that's in excess of our cost of capital. And as we indicated, with the steps in Commodities there is continued improvement in that ROE. In Fixed Income across a number of products we've already reached that type of return looking at RWAs or your capital on a normalized basis. We've added foreign exchange in 2013 notwithstanding what was challenging \u2013 more challenging foreign exchange market environment and we are looking to do the same with rate. So, it is very much if we are looking at what's the return for the overall firm, it is about achieving those types of returns for Fixed Income. But I'll repeat what I already said, which is, we are not assuming a recovery in the FICC market industry-wide in 2014. So, it is not much of a driver to the upside in our ROE.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Got it. And just lastly from me question on just regulation in the Wealth Management space. As one of the largest financial advisor networks in the country, just be curious for your thoughts around kind of potential amortization of whether there's differences between the SEC and FINRA regulated advisors and any potential implications for Morgan Stanley and its competitive positioning?","James Gorman","Boy, that's a pretty broad one. Honestly, we run the business and aspire to run it as well as anybody in the industry. We're constructively with the regulators. There are obviously some differences across FINRA and SEC but I'm not going to get into predicting harmonization impact on us. I would be very, very surprised if there are any material impacts on our business based upon any harmonization.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The final question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson","Thanks very much. Ruth, just to go back to Slide 14 for a moment. Obviously, the simple math is that looking at the potential numerator benefits gets you to 6 to 6.3. But I'm just curious about the box that you have in terms of potential offsets which foresights the balance sheet growth, I'm just trying to reconcile that with what James indicated the targets are on page 11. So does that -- does this outlook on \u201914 embed this asset growth and driven by the deposit growth over the next two years?","Ruth Porat","So on the -- when we described or show the growth in assets for the bank to be clear, that\u2019s looking at the asset side, so we have deposit growth, but we have equity supporting the bank. So that\u2019s the -- that\u2019s the asset side of the equation a bit higher than the deposit growth that we\u2019re talking about. When we go to the potential offsets we\u2019re looking at this ongoing, on boarding of deposits and yes it is built into our statements that it will be greater than 5% in 2015 with growing returns of capital. We manage overall the balance sheet to put \u2013 our balance sheet and capital behind growth areas within the firm, so we built in the capacity to have growth within the firm across our various businesses including the obvious deposit on boarding and so that\u2019s one potential offset that has been incorporated into our outlook and the greater than 5% and then capital returns I think speaks to itself.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson","Got it. And so does the same view get you to the SLR target on the bank level as well?","Ruth Porat","We are already at about 6% on the -- on our larger bank MSBNA and even higher than that on the other bank. We capitalized those banks to support the growth that we anticipate and so those are already in a strong position.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson","Got it. And so just finally on this -- so as I think about the ROE targets and all of this going forward, is it fair to say that the governing issue at this stage is much more the compliance with SLR than CCAR capital?","Ruth Porat","Our view is that we have a very strong flight path to greater than 5% in 2015 and that incorporates returns of capital. And so that doesn\u2019t serve as a constraint and so the CCAR process is -- it was obviously an annual process. We feel very good about what we have done over the last several years and last year with the consistency of the businesses that we have the ongoing accretion of capital, the ratios that we have, but we don\u2019t view the SLR as a constraint on that because we built into our forward look return, increasing returns of capital.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson","Okay. Thanks so much.","Celeste Brown","Thanks so much for joining us for our fourth quarter call and we will speak to you in 13 weeks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

This is Celeste Brown, Head of Investor Relations, and welcome to our First Quarter Earnings call. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management\u2019s current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The presentation may also include certain non-GAAP financial measures.

This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James Gorman","Thank you, Celeste. Good morning everybody and thanks for joining us. Before I comment on our performance this quarter, I\u2019ll discuss our thoughts on capital returns both for this year and for the medium to long term. The recently completed CCAR was a significant inflection point for us. As you know, we secured a non-objection to increase our capital returns. We respect the CCAR process and made significant investments in that process over the past several years and we have a program specifically focused on continuing to raise the bar each cycle.","In 2013, we asked for and received a non-objection to maintain our dividend and the ability to purchase the balance of the wealth management business. In mid-2013, we applied for our first buyback since 2007 of $500 million. In this latest CCAR, we applied to double the dividend, our first increase since 2007 and a $1 billion buyback. We intend to (indiscernible) to our capital request in future years.","Going forward, we will look to drive our dividend yield to at least levels commensurate with the broader S&P, which has historically been around 2%, sustained by growing earnings from wealth and investment management. In fact, an 80 to 100% payout on just the earnings from wealth and investment management suggests an annual dividend at two or three times our recent increased level just based on 2013 earnings and share count. ","In addition to growing our dividend substantially, we expect to continue to increase our buyback with a focus on both mitigating employee issuance and reducing our share count. Share buybacks will make up the difference between dividends and the total payouts which we intend to drive toward 100% of churn earnings over the next several years. Now clearly when we can do this is obviously a function of regulatory approval.","Turning now to the businesses in the first quarter, in challenging markets for institutional and retail investors, we drove our revenues and PBT higher across our three business segments versus a year ago as we continued to execute against our strategic plan. Ex-DVA, our revenues were up 4% versus the first quarter of 2013 while our expenses were up 1%. Our expense ratios improved across the segments and our overall earnings per share grew 13%. In fact, ex-DVA our earnings grew despite a significantly higher tax rate than a year ago. ","ROTE from continuing operations excluding DVA improved as well to 9.8% while ROE improved to 8.3%, up 130 basis points and 80 basis points year-over-year respectively. We continue to work towards sustainably higher ROEs across all of our businesses through the execution of our strategy with a particular focus on growth in the bank, which we believe is substantial, as well as on a fixed income ROE and our broader firm-wide expenses. ","I look forward to your questions at the end of the call. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Ruth to discuss the results in detail.","Ruth Porat","Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures. ","The impact of DVA in the quarter was positive $126 million with $76 million in fixed income sales and trading and $50 million in equities sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were $8.8 billion, up 7% versus the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 33%. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders excluding DVA were approximately $1.3 billion. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share excluding DVA were $0.68 after preferred dividends. On a GAAP basis including the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues for the quarter were $8.9 billion, earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $1.4 billion, reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.72 after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was $32.38 per share and tangible book value was $27.41 per share. ","Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were $835 billion at March 31. Deposits at quarter-end were $117 billion, up $4 billion versus 4Q. Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $203 billion compared with $202 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.","Turning to capital, although our calculations are not final, we believe that our common equity Tier 1 transitional ratio will be approximately 14.1% and our Tier 1 capital ratio under this regime will be approximately 15.6%. Risk-weighted assets are expected to be approximately $398 billion at March 31. Reflecting our best estimate of the final Federal Reserve rules, our common equity Tier 1 ratio using the pro forma Basel III fully phased in advanced approach was 11.6% at March 31. Our pro forma standardized ratio was 10.2%. We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the recent U.S. regulatory proposal to be approximately 4.2%. For reference, under the prior methodology, our supplementary leverage ratio is 4.5%, up from 4.2%. These estimates are preliminary and are subject to revision.","We continue to expect to see the required 5% level in 2015, including an assumption for increasing returns of capital to shareholders despite the Fed\u2019s recently announced more demanding requirements. In addition to the mitigation items we highlighted on the fourth quarter call, we see opportunities to mitigate the recent inclusion of the CDS long add-on through steps such as compression, re-hedging, and roll down. ","Turning to expenses, our total expenses this quarter were $6.6 billion, down 18% versus the fourth quarter due to significantly lower legal expense, seasonality, and our focus on cost reduction. Compensation expense was up 8% versus the prior quarter on higher revenue. Non-compensation expense was $2.3 billion primarily reflecting lower legal expenses, seasonality, and cost management. ","Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In institutional securities, revenues excluding DVA were $4.5 billion, up 21% sequentially. Non-interest expense was $3.3 billion, down 29% versus the fourth quarter. Compensation was $1.9 billion for the first quarter, up versus the fourth quarter on higher revenue, reflecting a 41% ratio excluding DVA. The decline in non-compensation expense to $1.4 billion primarily reflected significantly lower legal expenses. The business reported a pre-tax profit of $1.2 billion excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact of DVA, revenues were $4.6 billion and pre-tax profit was $1.4 billion. ","In investment banking, revenues of $1.1 billion were down 17% versus last quarter, reflecting seasonality. Results represent strong performance for our first quarter across all products. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked number one in global announced M&A and number two in global IPOs and global equity and equity linked at the end of the first quarter. Notable transactions included: in advisory, Morgan Stanley acted as advisor on the five largest transactions, including as exclusive financial advisor to WhatsApp on its $16 billion sale to Facebook \u2013 this transaction reflects Morgan Stanley\u2019s continued leadership in the largest and most complex transactions in the technology sector; and as exclusive financial advisor to Suntory Holdings in its acquisition of Beam Inc. for $16 billion. This continues our leadership in cross-border activity as well as in Japan. ","In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as joint global coordinator for the $2 billion IPO of Altice Group. This is the largest ever IPO of a cable operator in EMEA. Morgan Stanley also recently acted as lead financial advisor to Altice Numericable on its acquisition of Vivendi\u2019s phone unit, SFR, including acting as joint book runner on its \u20ac16 billion of non-investment grade acquisition financing.","In debt underwriting, Morgan Stanley also acted as active book runner for Exxon Mobile Corporation\u2019s $5.5 billion offering of senior unsecured notes. This transaction is Exxon\u2019s first U.S. dollar senior unsecured debt offering.","Advisory revenues of $336 million declined 25% versus our fourth quarter results due primarily to seasonality. Announced advisory transactions were up significantly versus a year ago. Equity underwriting revenues of $315 million were down 24% versus the fourth quarter driven by lower global market volumes and typical seasonality. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $485 million, essentially flat to the fourth quarter as market activity remained at very high levels. Equity sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were $1.7 billion, an increase of 13% from last quarter. Revenues were strong across regions and products driven by higher client activity. Case revenues were up driven by increased volumes in all regions. Prime brokerage revenues were up significantly driven by higher balances and robust client portfolio management activities. Derivatives revenues grew as volatility trended higher. ","Fixed income and commodities sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were $1.7 billion, up significantly from the fourth quarter. Revenues increased significantly in all major products. Commodities saw broad-based strength across the energy complex driven by extreme weather in North America and increased client demand. Revenues outside of commodities were driven higher by seasonality and strength in credit products. Average trading VAR for the first quarter was $50 million, essentially flat to the fourth quarter.","Turning to wealth management, revenues were $3.6 billion in the first quarter. Asset management revenues of $2 billion were up versus last quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher market levels at the beginning of the period and positive flows. Transaction revenues decreased 10% from last quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $540 million, down 6% versus the prior quarter due to fewer trading days; investment banking-related fees of $181 million, down 12% versus last quarter, reflecting a lower U.S. equity underwriting calendar, most notably with fewer closed-in funds; and trading revenues of $275 million, down 15% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting lower gains in deferred compensation plans. ","Net interest revenue increased 2% to $539 million driven primarily by higher revenues from our bank deposit program and continued growth in our lending products. Other revenue decreased to $62 million from $110 million. Net interest expense was $2.9 billion, down 3% versus last quarter. The compensation ratio was 60%, up versus the fourth quarter due to seasonality. Non-compensation expense was $762 million, down 13% versus last quarter due to the absence of an impairment charge as well as continued expense discipline.","The PBT margin was 19%. Profit before tax was $691 million. Total client assets surpassed $1.9 trillion. Global fee-based asset flows were $19 billion, a record level. Fee-based assets under management increased to a record $724 billion at quarter-end, representing 37% of client assets. Global representatives were 16,426, essentially flat to the fourth quarter. Bank deposits were $132 billion, down $1.6 billion versus the fourth quarter. Approximately $108 billion were held in Morgan Stanley banks.","We continued to grow our wealth management lending balances and increase our penetration rates with our retail client base. Our mortgage balances increased 10% and our PLA balances increased 9%, while our committed undrawn PLA facilities grew at an even more rapid pace. ","Investment management revenues of $740 million were down 12% from the fourth quarter. In traditional asset management, revenues of $437 million were up 2% from the fourth quarter driven by higher market levels and client flows. In real estate investing, revenues of $131 million were down 18% driven by lower investment gains. Merchant banking revenues were $172 million, down 32% driven by a tough comparison to very strong investment gains in the fourth quarter. Expenses were $477 million, down 6% from the fourth quarter due to declines in compensation and non-compensation expenses.","Profit before tax was $263 million, down 22% sequentially. MCI was $54 million versus $46 million last quarter. Total assets under management increased to $382 billion driven by market appreciation and increased flows.","Turning to our outlook, as we begin the second quarter, our investment banking pipeline is strong across all products. M&A is particularly robust. The pipeline is growing with an increase in activity from EMEA and Asia. On the financing side, the flow is healthy for both equity and fixed income underwriting. With respect to sales and trading, overall economic and market conditions continue to be favorable for equities; however, the challenges that weighed on certain parts of fixed income markets for much the quarter persist. On the retail side, trading activity is consistent with levels we saw in the first quarter, though we enter the tailwind from higher equity markets. In addition, we continue to have momentum with FA adoption and client penetration is increasing, an important driver of growth, profitability, and increased earnings consistency. ","Over the last several years, we have assiduously worked to reposition our businesses in a way that is aligned with regulatory change. We have made the tough decisions, provided metrics to demonstrate our progress, and have a suite of businesses that are complementary.","Thank you for listening, and James and I will now take your questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. ","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Hello. So I have a couple parter on commodities first, just if you could frame how much of a contributor it was to FIC in the quarter, whether it be relative to last year or prior peaks \u2013 obviously something went very well there.","Ruth Porat","Well, there were a number of important factors in the overall FIC performance, strength in commodities clearly being a big driver given volatility in the market due to weather and robust client activity; but as I noted, we also had strength in credit corporate and mortgages, and those continue to be strong areas for us. So overall, it was up meaningfully. It was the biggest driver in year-over-year performance.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Okay, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything you can update us on. There\u2019s one of the competitors sold a piece of their physical business. You guys have been contemplating that. A, if there\u2019s an update on that\/ and b, in the quarter how much of a contributor was that, just for the thought process on the go-forward?","Ruth Porat","Sure, yeah. To try and help you size it, you exclude the two physical oil businesses that we\u2019re selling, overall fixed income was up slightly year-over-year on a percentage basis, so still up excluding those two physical oil businesses. And then in terms of where we stand on that, we\u2019re continuing to work on the sale of Transmontaigne and we\u2019ll give you an update when we have something more to say on that.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Okay, that\u2019s cool. You also mentioned and we could see it in the numbers, prime brokerage is doing awesome. Curious on how you weigh that business doing as good as it\u2019s doing with the fact that you still have the lowest leverage ratio in the group and have some work to do. So I heard your comments on what you can do in derivs land, but is there any pricing benefit that you can pass through on prime brokerage? Just curious how you balance that. ","Ruth Porat","Well, I think there are really two different points within your question. Prime brokerage is a gem franchise for us. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking about how we manage our business across nine boxes, product on the one hand, cash, derivatives and PB and geography on the other hand \u2013 Americas, Europe and Asia \u2013 and we manage really intently within each box. But over many quarters, I\u2019ve talked about the importance of adjacencies, in particular with our PB clients. The deeper we go with them, the deeper they go across our franchise, so we think have a very positive, strong, mutually productive relationship with our PB clients, and that\u2019s an important franchise for us.","If I switch to the leverage part of your question, in our view we have a very strong, clear path to improve our leverage ratio, and it is consistent with the business strategy we\u2019ve talked about. The real levers are things that go to things like compression trades or RWA rundown and spec, so that\u2019s a very different answer. It doesn\u2019t affect what we are talking about here on the PB franchise side.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Okay, cool. I appreciate that. Last one \u2013 without opening too many cans of worms here, I wanted to get your thoughts on all the focus on high frequency and what it means for your equity business. How can you help us frame that? That would be super-helpful.","Ruth Porat","Sure. You know, since 2009 Morgan Stanley has been very vocal with regulators and has been on the record about the necessity for changes to market structure to protect clients. We\u2019ve advocated for increased transparency and trading protocol. You can see that in docs we\u2019ve filed with regulators as far back as 2009 \u2013 they\u2019re all in the public domain, so we welcome ongoing enhancement to equity market structure. I think we\u2019ve been a leading voice in this area for a long time and in fact we\u2019ve implemented protocol and governance consistent with this in our business.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","And then maybe just to be annoying, the book mentions a really big number for Speedway, and I think it controls a lot of volume. I don\u2019t know if you want to help us with what\u2019s the real number in terms of contribution or size that.","Ruth Porat","Well, just to clarify what it is, it\u2019s an execution tool in our electronic trading toolkit. It\u2019s consistent with offerings across the Street. We make it available to all our clients, many of whom you\u2019re familiar with, and the key to us in all that we do is risk management. Risk management checks add latency, and latency is inconsistent with extreme speed strategies. And also to clear up any source of confusion, it facilitates connectivity only to (indiscernible) around the world. It doesn\u2019t connect to any dark pool anywhere, and overall H&Ps (ph) are not a meaningful driver of our business. ","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Okay, that\u2019s good for me. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research","Thanks, good morning. I noticed that the capital allocated to the institutional business came down by about $1.5 billion linked quarter. Is that directly related to RWA reductions that you would have had in the fixed income business, or it more complicated than that? And if it is, maybe you can explain to us what\u2019s driving it.","Ruth Porat","Sure. It is more complicated than that, but we did have a further reduction in risk-weighted assets in fixed income. They\u2019re in fact down to $199 billion as of the first quarter, down from $210 billion in the fourth quarter, so continuing to make progress there.","The way we calculate required capital is based on whatever the capital regime is in place at a point in time. In this quarter as a result of the regime change, in particular with the Basel I numerator moving to the transitional Basel III numerator, that drove the capital reallocation. The Basel III transitional numerator by definition has deductions that phase in over time, so in managing the business we look towards a Basel III fully phased in lens. There are a couple of moving pieces \u2013 yes, we reduced the risk-weighted assets, but the biggest driver here at the table is the regime change.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research","Got it. And if I can just relate the comment that you made about the increase in the old-style SLR in the quarter, which I think you alluded to about 30 basis points, how does that relate to the target that you laid out back in January for a 30 or 40 basis point increase just from exposure, compression and the like? Is that being driven by that, or were there other puts and takes?","Ruth Porat","So there were a number of drivers. As I said, we\u2019re still very comfortable \u2013 greater than 5% in 2015, and with increasing returns of capital. This quarter in the numerator, we benefited from higher earnings, and as we talked in prior calls, that adds what I keep calling a multiplier effect because it reduces the deductions on DTAs, and importantly it also increases the investment capacity for those items that get into that 10% bucket, thereby reducing the numerator deduction.","In addition to that, we have been quite focused on mitigating some of the numerator deductions, so you\u2019re seeing the benefit of that beginning to flow through, and then in the denominator of course we continue in with compression trades in RWA reductions, as I indicated.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research","Got it, and then just to beat a little bit on the SLR horse, there has been a proposal made just in the month of March by Basel\u2014people assign different acronyms to it, but I\u2019ve heard SACCR, which would be a standardized approach to counterparty credit, which I\u2019ve heard broadly could be a plus as well. I was wondering if you had done any numbers on that preliminarily.","Ruth Porat","Yeah, if SACCR is adopted, that would be about a 50 basis point benefit to the SLR and a 30 basis point benefit to the standardized ratio.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research","Wow, so it\u2019s quite meaningful.","Ruth Porat","It is.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research","And you\u2019re calling it SACCR \u2013 is that a patented Morgan Stanley term?","Ruth Porat","You can use it if you want.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research","Okay, thanks. I guess the only other question that I would really have would be if you could\u2014you know, we talked a little bit about commodities and the fact that fixed income would still have been up, or FIC would still have been up year-over-year even with the planned sales having taken place. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you saw in the rates business in the quarter, because obviously for banks that have a heavier contribution from rates and from FX, so what\u2019s called the macro businesses, we saw much, much weaker results so far.","Ruth Porat","Well look, I think that we\u2014and I said this\u2014and we saw the same headwinds you\u2019ve heard from others with lower client activity. That was a tougher market, just given all that was going on in the environment. For our rates business, it was down year-over-year, reflecting lower volumes, but up nicely versus last quarter. We are really focused on this centralized, federalized resource management across all of the macro product, but it was a tougher part of the market.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research","Got it. So mix was just one of the more important differentiators for you guys, I guess? ","Ruth Porat","It was. As I said, it was commodities, it was credit, it was mortgage.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research","Right. Just one final question on wealth management \u2013 a 10% increase in the loan balances linked quarter is obviously strategically what we want to see, but it is a very large percentage on what\u2019s starting to be a fairly sizeable business. How comfortable are you that your risk controls are where they need to be in what\u2019s obviously been a tough mortgage market?","Ruth Porat","So the growth\u2014again, we\u2019ve got a couple of things going for us. One is very low penetration with a very large client base. We\u2019re meaningfully underpenetrated versus our peers, and we\u2019ve been slow to build this product precisely for the reason you flagged, which is top of our list, which is ensure tight, proper credit risk management and all of the processes around it, as well as ensuring that it\u2019s a good experience for our clients and our financial advisors. So it\u2019s up a nice percentage.","I would say the other thing that\u2019s benefiting that is it\u2019s up a nice percentage off of a small number, and we\u2019re continuing to see good growth in the mortgage side given this low penetration. We\u2019re finding that FAs who use the product are using it longer and increasing their penetration. The credit standards are very tight \u2013 you know, FICO (indiscernible) 50, LTV 60%; and again, it\u2019s with our client base so we know the clients. We have their assets here.","The other growth area in PLA is a very\u2014is the highly over-collateralized, significantly over-collateralized product, as I think you know. It\u2019s securities-based lending, and again it\u2019s all with our existing client base. There\u2019s virtually no credit losses to date, and risk management has been the driver across all of these businesses.","Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research","Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Good morning guys. So just a real quick one to clarify, I believe, Ruth, you said that your IB backlog is up. Just wanted to make sure \u2013 is that based on year-end, because Goldman highlighted that their IB backlog actually shrunk since year-end.","Ruth Porat","So our backlog is up across all products from year-end. M&A, as I noted, in particular is strong and the pipeline continues to build. I think you can see that just from the flurry of announcements that have occurred since quarter-end.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Yeah \u2013 no, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s just good to see continued momentum there. Then another one \u2013 the CCAR was sort of a surprise here to some firms this year, and I guess the Fed highlighted some process improvements in their comments. Do you guys have any outstanding process improvements with the Fed, and was there anything in that CCAR process that sort of jumped out that investors should be aware of?","Ruth Porat","So I think the whole industry is waiting kind of the formal Fed feedback process, but I think\u2014you know, we generally received positive feedback about our processes. As James said in his opening comments, we\u2019ve invested meaningfully in the process and for the last several years, we had something we call our CIP program \u2013 continuous improvement program. So regardless of what we even hear back, we look to up the approach and the analytics each year, and that process hasn\u2019t stopped. We continue to raise the bar for ourselves on the overall process. We feel good about our processes around CCAR. ","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Terrific. And is it your view that the Fed feels good about your processes as well? I understand you can\u2019t\u2014based on the information you received from the Fed, is that your perception?","James Gorman","Brennan, I don\u2019t think we want to get in the business of trying to explain what the Fed\u2019s view or isn\u2019t. All that mattered to us is we put in for a buyback and dividend and they are approved, and we\u2019re continuing down the path that we laid out.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Appreciate it. Just trying to maybe get some insights into what is proving to be a very murky process for all of us on this end.","James Gorman","Understood.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Then is it right that you guys have slimmed down your management structure in wealth management? I think we saw a reduction in the number of divisions and regions. And maybe, could you help us think about whether that\u2019s driven by potential expense basics or whether that\u2019s done to slim down decision-making and the like. Maybe help us understand that move a little bit.","James Gorman","I think it\u2019s probably what I would describe as the last gasp post-the integration. This has been a four-year integration, and now that the business is very stable, I think the FA account was flat to maybe modestly up. The new leadership under Shelley O\u2019Connor determined that she could make some changes there to just make the organization faster moving, a little more nimble, a little more efficient, and put the team in place to make that happen.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Great. Thanks a lot for taking the questions.","James Gorman","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","","Hi. So to the extent that prime brokerage has performed better, can you give us any numbers around that \u2013 what are the prime brokerage revenues this quarter versus a year or two ago, or can you give us some market share figures around your prime brokerage business?","Ruth Porat","Well as you know, we don\u2019t break out components within businesses. The client balances and revenues are all up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Okay, and how does it compare to the time of the crisis? I remember a lot of clients were leaving Morgan Stanley and then they\u2019ve come back. Have you gotten back to pre-crisis levels? Do you expect to get back there?","Ruth Porat","These are the highest balances that we\u2019ve had since the crisis. We\u2019ve continued to nicely steadily build.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Okay. Shifting over to wealth management, you\u2019re redeploying the deposits. What are the yields and margin that you\u2019re getting as you deploy those deposits?","Ruth Porat","So last quarter in the deck, we laid out a couple of things because we thought it was important as everyone was doing their analysis that we show you what the asset growth would be and the changing mix over time as we moved from cash into FAS and loan deployment and included yields there, current yields, and then just to follow the forward yield curve. Those really haven\u2019t\u2014you know, we\u2019re getting the benefit of the improving mix, but yield by product hasn\u2019t really changed much, as you can see, with the rate environment. But really, the upside to us is the ongoing deployment across the portfolio. ","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Separately, I\u2019m looking at your deck from January where you said you wanted to drive ROE above 10% in fixed income and commodities. Did you exceed that in the first quarter, and how is that progressing?","Ruth Porat","Well, we\u2019ve certainly had progress because you can see the revenues, and I just provided the RWAs. So we\u2019ve had higher revenues, reduced RWAs, now down to $199 billion \u2013 that\u2019s relative to the $210 billion last quarter, and to about 250-ish last year. So we\u2019re certainly getting better returns in that business, and our view is that we have more do to there.","As we said, when we look at ROE and we\u2019re managing to ROE in that business, it\u2019s about revenues, expenses and capital optimization, and the team is continuing to focus on all of those.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Can you give us any update on the run-off of legacy assets in FIC?","Ruth Porat","I think you sort of get that, Mike, in the RWA rundown. So that\u2019s a combination of passive and active, and part of the active is how trades are structured and part of it is actually running down as much as we can as rapidly as we can. So if you go back to third quarter of \u201911, we had $390 billion of risk-weighted assets in our fixed income business, and as you know, we keep bringing forward our target in time. We dropped for that $180 billion from 2016 to 2015, and what that really captures is your question \u2013 we\u2019re running down those legacy assets as rapidly as we can. We are pleased to have that deadweight capital pushed out of the business.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","And then my last question \u2013 your ROE target is for a 9% ROE, and this quarter you\u2019re still below that. Can you either re-affirm or give us a time frame when you think you\u2019ll achieve your ROE target? I\u2019m not seeing return on tangible common equity \u2013 if you can give that to us, too.","Ruth Porat","Right. So on the ROE, we\u2019re looking at an ROE in excess of cost of capital. We\u2019re talking about a 10% ROE. I appreciate you\u2019re looking at the building blocks we provided last quarter. We did see progress across our businesses, and our view is that the upside continues to come from the bank. It\u2019s in its early days, and given the opportunity with the bank and moving again from over-weighted in cash to deployment into loans as well as AFFs, there\u2019s a real benefit there, the continued focus on expense management and then the ongoing higher return to capital. That 9% number is obviously without higher capital returns. We\u2019re pleased to have doubled our dividend, doubled our share repurchase program, and as James said, our intent is to continue increasing return to capital over time.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","So just to be clear, so now your target\u2014since you\u2019re able to return capital now, your target is now 10% return on common equity?","Ruth Porat","Our target has consistently been 10%. What we tried to break out last quarter was what it would be without higher return to capital, and then the return to capital takes it above and beyond that. But we continue to be focused on 10% return on capital as kind of the next stop along the way.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Okay, and this quarter return on tangible common equity was what?","Ruth Porat","Nine-point-three\u20149.8, I apologize Mike. Nine-point-eight.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Okay, 9.8. Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak with Nomura.","Steve Chubak \u2013 Nomura","Good morning. I wanted to discuss your 10% FIC ROE target for a moment. Clearly the progress you\u2019ve made in mitigating RWAs has been nothing short of extraordinary, which has driven required capital levels down pretty meaningfully. What I\u2019m wondering is given the tough treatment for derivatives under the modified SLR approach, even when we contemplate some of the future benefits from various forms of mitigation, whether it\u2019s CDS maturity matching, SACCR model approval, et cetera, it appears that required capital for FIC under the modified SLR calculation could still be pretty materially above that under the risk-based framework. So essentially, I just wanted to clarify that the 10% FIC ROE target which you\u2019ve highlighted in the past is still achievable whether one evaluates under a leveraged or a risk-based lens.","Ruth Porat","Yes, and we look at our businesses under a risk-based and leverage-based capital lens now. It\u2019s the current leverage-based capital rule; but again, we have the added lens of what\u2019s at the SLR and business unit leaders have their balance sheet under that SLR lens, and that\u2019s helping really put a spotlight on the opportunities for mitigation in the areas where mitigation is absolutely key. So as you pointed out in your question, there are additional work streams that can added to that, which we discussed last quarter, with the inclusion now of net long CDS, so that opens up an added work stream. So we do see a good path forward to greater than 5% under the SLR, including higher return to capital; and yes, we hold ourselves accountable for that greater of risk-based capital and leverage-based capital.","Steve Chubak \u2013 Nomura","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. One of the things I wanted to inquire about was the Fed had clearly stated its plan to consider applying additional capital surcharges on wholesale borrowings. The details that have been disclosed thus far regarding the methodology or the potential approach remain somewhat murky, but I wanted to see if you had any additional thoughts or insights regarding how that rule-making could potentially shake out.","Ruth Porat","So you\u2019re right \u2013 the rule is\u2014the discussion at this point is unclear. I think the terms that have been used, such as short term wholesale funding is one phrase. We talk a lot about the difference between short-term wholesale funding and durable funding, and we\u2019ve invested quite meaningfully, as we\u2019ve talked about on many calls, to term out our secured book, and that\u2019s built in durability that has been evident in all sorts of periods of market stress, market stress in Europe. We think that liquidity durability is important. You know, our LCR, we\u2019re well north of the 100% requirement in large part because of all that we\u2019ve done, all that we\u2019ve invested. I mean, it doesn\u2019t come for free \u2013 it\u2019s expensive to term it out and get that durability, but we have an LCR that\u2019s higher than 100% for that reason and we\u2019re very supportive of the Federal Reserve\u2019s focus on CLAR, the mirror test of CCAR but focused on liquidity, given all that we\u2019ve done to build in what is a very durable approach to liquidity and funding.","So don\u2019t know which way it goes because some terms are being used in a sort of broad way; but again, given what we\u2019ve done with our capital stack, we feel that we\u2019ve built in a lot of the durability that is what regulators are looking for.","Steve Chubak \u2013 Nomura","Okay, and I guess one more question on the SLR proposal. Parsing out the language in the Fed\u2019s document, it highlighted two key size criteria for identifying systemically important banks, one being GAAP assets in excess of $700 billion and AUC in excess of $10 trillion. Based on your interpretation of the Fed proposal, do you believe that the GSIV (ph) classification can potentially be avoided for those banks which operate below those designated thresholds, and specifically would you consider optimizing your balance sheet size if it enabled you to potentially bypass the tougher 5% leverage rule, or is that simply not a viable strategic option given growth initiatives at the bank and other potential opportunities that will drive future balance sheet growth?","Ruth Porat","Well, given our suite of businesses and the strength of these businesses, we don\u2019t see going below $700 billion as practical. In particular, we see the opportunity to mitigate a number of the items, as I\u2019ve already discussed, both the gross up in the denominator and reduce some of the deductions in the numerator, which are accretive to the SLR. If you look at some of the\u2014the relationship across our various businesses, so for example as I talked about on prior calls, within our investment banking franchise, quarter after quarter after quarter, we\u2019ve had about $500 million of fixed income underwriting, and that\u2019s a service that our clients want, it\u2019s accretive to the overall relationship, it\u2019s accretive to the bottom line for the firm, and it does require that we have a corporate credit capability \u2013 you know, origination and distribution. So there are a lot of linkages between the businesses, increasingly so with the wealth management business, and our view is that when we look to the single most important thing, which is how do we drive ROE for this firm given there is a path to increase the SLR that enables us to keep the suite of products as we\u2019ve defined them and as we\u2019ve reshaped what we\u2019re doing in fixed income, our judgment is that the best way to drive ROE is with this suite of products, and we don\u2019t see how that would take us lower than $700 billion of assets.","Steve Chubak \u2013 Nomura","Okay, understood. And just one final one on the numerator upside you had discussed regarding the SLR. We really appreciate the helpful detail in terms of the individual components that you disaggregated driving the 80 basis point build in the SLR over\u2014towards that 5% goal. I was hoping you could at least clarify the level of incremental preferred issuance that\u2019s assumed to help close that gap, just to get some clarify on those which will impact future earnings versus those which will have\u2014essentially be earnings neutral.","Ruth Porat","Sure. So the\u2014as you saw, we did about $2 billion of preferred last year \u2013 that was in two transactions. We will continue to optimize our capital stack and do think that preferred plays a valuable role in that, so we\u2019re going to continue to leg into more over time. I think when you\u2014you know, the two that we did last year, you can see that we tried to size them\u2014modestly size them or appropriately size them, whatever word you want to use for it, and we\u2019ll continue to leg into more of time. So that is another addition to the numerator.","I would say that what we\u2019re quite pleased about is the pace with which we\u2019ve been able to mitigate a number of those numerator deductions, and that investment basket has within it a couple of opportunities to continue to mitigate some of the numerator drag.","Steve Chubak \u2013 Nomura","That\u2019s great. Thank you for taking my questions, and congrats on a strong quarter.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning. Can you update us on the expense efforts? Obviously good revenue this quarter, so expenses were higher; but it sounded like in the past that there\u2019s still some opportunities within FIC to manage the expense base. I was hoping for an update either on FIC expenses or just overall expenses.","Ruth Porat","So we\u2019re very much on track for the expense target ratio that we laid out at the end of 2012, going into 2013; and just as a reminder, at the time we had an 84% expense ratio, and with the $1.6 billion reduction, assuming revenue\u2019s constant so you don\u2019t have to adjust for the noise around activity-based revenues, we said we would get to a 79% expense ratio, excluding elevated legal expenses and, if there any write-offs, any write-offs, and that would be by the end of 2014. ","This quarter, we\u2019re at a 75% expense ratio excluding DVA, so I think what that underscores is expense\u2014you know, very much part of the DNA of all of our business leaders. We have the balance of the year to continue focusing on expense reduction, but it\u2019s built into programs across all of the various businesses and we\u2019re constantly looking for ways to add to the program. It doesn\u2019t end this year; it keeps going. It\u2019s just business as usual at this point, but we\u2019re pleased that we\u2019re at a 75% expense ratio relative to that 79% with still more time to get to the end of the year, when we said we would hit that number.","Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, and if the revenue environment improves, a little bit tougher from here in, say, the markets businesses, do you feel like you can still maintain the expense ratio around here, or still look back towards a 79% goal?","Ruth Porat","So what we indicated was that we would be at a 79\u2014back at the end of 2012 when we laid out the $1.6 billion, we said a 79% expense ratio assuming revenues were flat to 2012. Again, depending on where the world goes, I think what we\u2019ve evidenced over the last many years here is that we don\u2019t stand still, but we\u2019re pleased with the way we\u2019re starting off the year.","Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Outside of the core expenses, it didn\u2019t seem like there was any unusual litigation this quarter. I know it\u2019s really hard to tell looking forward, but any thoughts on how we should be modeling out litigation expense from here?","Ruth Porat","Well, you sort of answered the question \u2013 it is lumpy, as you\u2019ve seen. Our view is that litigation does remain a headwind for the industry. We\u2019re pleased to have FHFA behind us, but legal can be lumpy, as you\u2019ve seen.","Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just switching to the wealth management, the 19% PBT was in line with what we had for this quarter. Just any updates on how you feel about the 22 to 25% target by the end of next year?","Ruth Porat","We still feel very good about that, and I\u2019ll hold that as something that we are looking to deliver. As you know, that doesn\u2019t assume any benefit from rates in the environment. We\u2019ve got a number of factors that are taking that higher. I think one of the important ones really is what we\u2019re continuing to do with lending product and the benefit from the growth in lending, and you can see the ongoing momentum there. What we\u2019re pleased about is we\u2019ve always said we have a bit of a tailwind given we\u2019re underpenetrated with our clients, and what we\u2019re seeing is as FAs starting working with their clients with lending product, they continue to further penetrate their client base and we see much more of a take-up. So that is an important element of it, along with, back to your prior question, the continued focus on expense management. ","Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of American Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe a follow up on the wealth management business. You mentioned some seasonality in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter, I think fewer days. Maybe just a little color on the comp \u2013 Matt just asked about the margin, about how that impacts it, and just the outlook as we kind of go throughout the year, just assuming less seasonality.","Ruth Porat","So as you said, seasonality comes from a couple of things. One is several fewer trading days relative to the fourth quarter. There\u2019s also seasonality on the comp line because FICA is a first quarter event, so when we compare our 19% quarter this year to our 17% quarter last year, that\u2019s really isolating the difference in quarterly seasonality and a nice pick-up from the 17% last year to the 19% this year.","What we also saw in the first quarter this year was some lower issuance activity, in particular in closed end funds, and what\u2019s of greatest interest within the wealth management system is U.S. new issue product, and in particular closed in funds, and that was just a bit lower. We had a nice underwriting calendar but it was more skewed outside of the U.S. and very little in closed end fund activity. So as we\u2019re looking forward to the second quarter, we have a couple tailwinds going into the second quarter. Asset management fees will be modestly higher given the starting S&P level, and we\u2019re clearly focused on the transaction volume which is a function of the environment and the new issue calendar; but the pipeline is stronger in the U.S. It\u2019s clearly too early to tell, but it\u2019s stronger in the U.S. And then in aggregate, expenses should be a bit lower given the comp point I made \u2013 FICA being a first quarter event, and non-comps do tend to be a little bit higher in the second quarter but overall should result in an improved margin here.","Michael Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, just on the trading side, whether it\u2019s on equities or fixed income, anything lumpy this quarter, and then any color\u2014I know it\u2019s still early, but on the fixed income side in terms of the OTC markets transitioning on to SEF, like any color there. Thanks.","Ruth Porat","So as it relates\u2014nothing really lumpy to note. I mean, we had\u2014there was a good volume of activity, prime brokerage activity with portfolio rebalancing, just given volatility in equity markets; and then in terms of the impact of SEF on the market, we really think the lower volumes last quarter were related to broader market events, and in particular lower volumes in macro, as I\u2019ve already commented on, given all that was going on globally, and markets lack conviction \u2013 they traded in a tight range. Spread product did better, but macro was weaker, and we think it\u2019s very tough to disaggregate the extent to which, if at all, that was really SEF-related. We think that it was swamped by what was going on in macro.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the expense question. I just want to check \u2013 if you think about your closest competitor on an apples-to-apples basis, they\u2019re at around a 70% expense ratio. You guys are 75% in the strongest quarter, a target of 79%. Do you think this is an interim target and you can get more as you move forward as revenues get better, and\/or you still have some more expense leverage elsewhere? Can you just kind of walk through that?","Ruth Porat","Well, I obviously can\u2019t comment on any other peers, and we each have different business mixes. You know, I\u2019m often asked the question about our comp ratio, as an example, and the comp ratio in wealth management is off of a formulaic grid so it starts higher than their institutional securities business. And is it trending lower? Yes, it absolutely is trending lower. We\u2019ve talked about that quite a bit. It will continue to benefit from the growth in lending product, but you\u2019ve got some real apples-to-oranges comparisons if you just start with that line.","As it relates to our non-comp expenses, we\u2019re continuing to see benefit across the franchise, the ability to use technology more broadly across the franchise as an example, and so we are focused on the items that we identified internally as part of the 2014 plan, as I said. We\u2019re continuing to add to it because it\u2019s part of the DNA within all of the business unit leaders to look for opportunities to be efficient, whether it\u2019s working across divisions or in any other approach to the business. But just going back to my comp differential, I\u2019d say part of it is also business mix.","And to be clear, those business mixes also have different capital requirements, and there are a whole host of different elements that go along with it. So when we talk about ROE, it\u2019s revenue, expenses and capital.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Fair enough. I was just talking about the institutional business, but I hear your point. Maybe just quickly another question on the dividend. I think James had mentioned looking at a payout that would approximately or get close to the net income of the wealth management business, but as that business grows, it seems like if you were to approach that level of dividend payout, you\u2019d exceed the sort of 30% soft cap with the Fed. Do you think that is doable?","James Gorman","I don\u2019t want to get into sort of hard projections, but what we\u2019re indicating is that with our business mix now, with half the firm\u2019s business essentially coming from a relatively stable annuitized set of businesses in wealth and asset management, one thinks about your dividend payout a little bit differently as it relates to your ability to afford it coming from things that you know are fairly predictable.","Obviously when you aggregate it all, you come up against what appropriate payout levels are at a regulated level, and that\u2019s a different question. We\u2019re simply indicating we believe we have capacity, given our business mix.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay \u2013 no, that\u2019s helpful. One last quickie \u2013 on the physical oil sale, you mentioned or sort of gave a guide on the revenue impact. What would be the net income impact? I assume it\u2019s a lot smaller.","Ruth Porat","In terms of the businesses that we are looking to sell, as I indicated last quarter, one of the things that was quite intriguing was precisely that, is the more modest PBT and we\u2019re reducing risk-weighted assets pretty meaningfully.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","So it\u2019s ROE-accretive?","Ruth Porat","Yeah, and that\u2019s over\u2014obviously over time. You have to transition these things.","Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research","Sure, right. Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan \u2013 JMP Securities","Hey, good morning. How are you? I just have a couple follow ups on investment banking. So I guess first with respect to M&A, announced activity in North America has actually recovered since August levels 2007, but you guys have been noting on the last couple calls here that EMEA more recently has been feeling better. I just wanted to get some thoughts \u2013 does it feel like we\u2019re still on a distressed asset sale cycle in Europe, or are you starting to see more traditional strategic M&A accelerating there, which I think would be necessary to see a real recovery in activity in that region.","Ruth Porat","","Well, we\u2019ve seen some broadening across industries of activity, and what we still haven\u2019t seen is a real growth in the number of deals, but if you look at the dollar volume in EMEA, it\u2019s up, and the acquirer activity out of EMEA, cross-border activity is up. So again, it\u2019s early days but what\u2019s very positive is whenever a negative trend reverses itself. And comparable to GDP growth in EMEA is still modest, but it\u2019s gone from negative to positive and we\u2019re starting to see the knock-on benefit to some of the activity levels.","James Gorman","And I would just add the largest economy and the economy that\u2019s doing best over there is Germany, and having made a couple of trips recently, I think the corporate CEOs are still quite conservative in their views, so there will be a tipping point here. Obviously with what\u2019s going on with Russia and the Ukraine, that\u2019s putting a damper particularly on the German CEO view until we get better clarity there, but I think there will be a tipping point and we\u2019re not there yet. There have been isolated transactions across the U.K., Spain and other places.","Devin Ryan \u2013 JMP Securities","Great. Appreciate that color. And then fixed income underwriting results have obviously also remained really resilient, and I know it\u2019s still an attractive rate environment but are you starting to see a mix shift there at all in terms of what products are really driving this strength? Has there been any change in mix?","Ruth Porat","There has in the sense that it\u2019s been much more of a refinancing story, and now we\u2019re starting to see the benefit of the higher levels of M&A. In the first quarter, I think what was notable was there were a lot of deals across investment grade, high yield, leveraged loans. It wasn\u2019t as though there were some really big, chunky items that drove the quarter. It was a balance across the various products. But what you\u2019re starting to see is much more of this is event-related, and we think given the pipeline in M&A, that bodes well for continuation of strong debt underwriting, notwithstanding the fact that we\u2019ve had a long string here of strong quarters with debt underwriting.","Devin Ryan \u2013 JMP Securities","Okay. I guess just with respect to how that ties in with FIC results, there was a flurry of activity in corporate issuance in March, so I\u2019m just trying to get a better understanding around the strong results within credit and maybe how much of that was a function of issuance really starting to pick up towards the tail end of the quarter. Any color around maybe how credit specifically progressed throughout the first quarter.","Ruth Porat","Credit on the fixed income side was pretty consistent throughout the quarter. I think if you go back a couple of quarters ago when there was more volatility in credit markets, what you saw was notwithstanding a strong new issue calendar, it was pretty much buy and hold and you didn\u2019t see the follow-through to secondary trading. You\u2019re seeing more of that follow-through to secondary trading now, and hopefully that continues, in particular given the volume of what we would expect would continue to be new issue product on the fixed income side, assuming the M&A pipeline continues to hold up and we see the execution continuing as it has these first couple of weeks in the quarter.","Devin Ryan \u2013 JMP Securities","Great, thank you.","Celeste Brown","Thank you so much for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking to you at the end of the second quarter."],"15063":["Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call July 19, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Sharon Yeshaya - Head of Investor Relations","James Gorman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Company","Andrew Lim - Societe Generale","Gerrard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Christopher wheeler - Atlantic Equities","Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW","Sharon Yeshaya","Good morning.

During today\u2019s presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.","Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James Gorman","Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In the second quarter, we achieved 9% ROE reflecting the stability of many of our businesses, which offset a relatively difficult trading environment. In many ways, this quarter provided a robust test of our business strategy. Whilst many trading businesses are affected by benign markets, characterized by low volatility and the absence of meaningful macro events, other business lines demonstrative resilience.","Investment banking showed continued strength, reflecting diversity of our global M&A and capital markets franchises. Investment management, saw asset inflows and solid performance across alternatives. As a result, this business saw improved revenues and returns.","Wealth management performed at the high end of our 2017 target, achieving 25% pre-tax margin and a record profit before tax of over $1 billion. It is worth noting that in the first year after the acquisition of Smith Barney, wealth management generated approximately $1 billion to pre-tax profit annually.","Compensation expenses are in line with our stated targets and higher accruals year-to-date reflect higher revenues. Non-compensation expenses, include one notable item, which Jon will take you through in a moment.","Given the obvious headwind this quarter, we\u2019re pleased to have generated respectable return to shareholders, albeit at the bottom-end of our target range. Of course with the firm now on solid footing, [performance] (Ph) could still materially improve in the years ahead assuming constructive markets.","In addition, there are three tailwinds worth calling out, each of which has the potential to impact our long-term performance in a material and positive way, capital, tax reform and interest rates.","On capital, this year through CCAR, we asked for and received approval to buyback up to $5 million of stock and increase our dividend to an aggregate of $1 per share annually. While we intend to invest in our business as opportunities present themselves, we\u2019re determined to use any excess capital to continue to reduce our share count.","Much has been told through adjustments as some of the Doug Frank rules that were put in place over the past eight years. It is fair to say that now is the time to make some practical changes for the multitude of regulations. These changes would allow U.S. banks to be greater engines of economic growth.","Second, U.S. corporate taxes are too high. If the administration in Congress can achieve a sensible realignment of tax rates with other major developed economies, then that would be a clear positive for our business and corporate America in general.","Finally, as the major U.S. depository we have endured historically low interest rates for a very long time. Each move when hiring rates assuming a measured path should benefit our business. In summary, in the second quarter we showed resilient in a challenging market. In a more favorable environment, we should see better results.","More interesting to us though, of a long-term impact as some of the changes just described. We\u2019ve built meaningful operating leverage in our business, while we remain cautious in the near-term, we launch our business mix and remain bullish on the long-term outlook for the firm.","I will now turn the call over to John to discuss the quarter in greater detail. Thank you.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you and good morning. The optimism that characterized the first quarter was replaced with a more subdued tone amongst clients for the majority of the second quarter. Activity was more sporadic in market sensitive businesses particularly within fixed income were impacted. That said, we supported our clients when market opportunities presented themselves.","Equity sales and trading and investment banking produced strong results. Wealth management and investment management both witnessed continued growth and stabilized our headline performance. Firm revenues were $9.5 billion, down 2% compared to a strong Q1. PBT was $2.6 billion, EPS was $0.87 and ROE was 9.1.","Non-compensation expenses were up approximately $138 million or 65 quarter-over-quarter. Well over half of the increase was due to a provision that we recorded as a result of a self identified item relating to that on inter-company services provided to our UK operation.","We also saw some seasonal increase in professional services, marketing and business development and higher volume driven expenses. We continue to exercise compensation expense discipline, which led to a 1% sequential decline in total non-interest expense.","On project streamline, virtually all identified projects are in flight and we are on-track to complete the target outlined at the start of last year. Compared to the same period in 2016, our 2017 year-to-date revenues have increased by over $2.5 billion. In the same period, our non-compensation expenses have increased by about $300 million and total expenses by approximately $1.3 million in the same comparison.","As a result, our year-to-date efficiency ratio of 72% is approximately 300 basis points lower than the same period last year and remains well inside the 74% target for the full-year. That said, we recognize that expenses in any one quarter maybe impacted by business mix, geographical mix, seasonal patterns and other factors.","During the remainder of 2017, our focus will be on completing all remaining initiatives and making sure that the culture of costs discipline represented by project streamline remains best practice. This will help ensure that the savings achieved to-date remain permanently out of the expense based.","Now to the businesses. Net revenues across institutional securities businesses of $4.8 billion were down 8% sequentially. The trading environment slowed from the first quarter, market moving events were episodic, volatility in many asset classes hit multi-year lows and activity was sporadic. Despite the quarter-over-quarter decline revenues across ISG were strong.","Non-competition expenses were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 6% sequentially driven by the UK VAT expense, as well as higher execution related costs due to a shift in business and geographic mix of client activity.","Compensation expenses were $1.7 billion with the compensation to net revenue ratio of approximately 35%. In investment banking, both advisory and underwriting performed well revenues of $1.4 billion were unchanged versus the first quarter. This result contributed to an exceptionally strong first half of the year.","Advisory revenues for the quarter were $504 million, up 2% sequentially. Broadly M&A volumes remain healthy. The fundamental drivers of activity including challenging organic growth remained in place encouraging client engagement.","However, we have seen a decrease in larger transformational deals on a year-to-date basis compared to 2016 as the current market environment is impacting management\u2019s decision to act. Additionally uncertainty over taxes, regulatory reform and the broader political landscape will likely weigh on activity. As such, we remain cautious as we look towards the rest of the year.","Turning to underwriting, our continuation of stable capital markets with low volatility and range down credit spreads contributed to another strong quarter for underwriting. Overall, equity volumes continue to recover from the weak level seen last year particularly in Europe. The market was receptive to both IPOs and follow-on. We generated equity revenues of $405 million, up 4%. We expect activity levels to remain healthy although near-term issuance windows maybe impacted by macroeconomic uncertainties and a typical summer slowdown.","Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased 5% sequentially to $504 million, a market wide decline in volumes relative to strong first quarter was partially offset by market share gains across both investment grade bond and high yield financing.","Our sales and trading performance was solid, the post election excitement that began to slow towards the end of the first quarter did not reassert itself for most of the second quarter predominantly impacting our fixed income franchise.","However, activities saw a notable uptick towards the end of the period as rates felled off. This contributed to our overall performance and underscores the strength and resilience of our franchise.","In equities, we retained our leadership position and expect to be number one globally with revenues of $2.2 billion, up 7% sequentially. Strong prime brokerage revenues aided by seasonal factors contributed to the sequential increase.","We continue to witness growth in client balances positioning us well in this business. Derivative revenues remain solid. These gains were partially offset by lower cash revenues driven by lower volatility. Once again, our diversified strategy and global footprint benefited from pocket to regional strength. In the quarter we saw a very strong European activity as well as increases up in Asia.","Fixed income revenues in the second quarter were $1.2 billion down 28% versus a very strong first quarter and 4% versus a year ago. Historically, low volatility, a rally in interest rates over most of the quarter and fewer market events contributed to a slowdown in overall performance, while the revenue showed a sequential decline given the market backdrop, we\u2019re pleased with the results.","In our credit businesses revenues were down quarter-over-quarter driven by lower levels of activity. Our securitized products business also witnessed a decrease in revenues compared to last quarter, as the frequency of larger transaction slowed.","Within macro, our rates businesses were negatively impacted by low levels of volatility. This was partially offset by foreign exchange in emerging markets where discreet geopolitical events and pockets of volatility lead to stronger revenues. Commodities saw a sequential decline as there were fewer structured deals in the quarter.","While the environment did weigh on the results, this quarter revenues underscores the progress the business has made over the last 18 months. Since we restructured our business in 2015, we have experienced various market backdrops. Clearly, some have been more favorable than others.","We are encouraged by the consistency of recent results and are critically and credibly sized to service our clients as the backdrop evolves. Average trading VaR for the period was $51 million up versus $44 million last quarter. We deployed capacities to support accretive client opportunities.","Now turning to wealth management, which reported another record quarterly revenue and pre-tax profit result. The revenue and margin achievements underscores the businesses ability to benefit from the scale of the platform. These results were achieved despite a normalization in activity following a strong first quarter as retail sentiment reflected the same uncertainties faced by our institutional clients.","Second quarter revenues were $4.2 billion a 2% sequential increase. The PBT margin 25% slightly above our full-year 2017 target range reflected growth in fee based revenues and operating leverage. Client assets grew 2% to $2.2 trillion, fee based assets increased 4% to $962 billion were 43% of total client assets.","While the department of labor fiduciary rule has contributed to these fee base close, the majority of the movements have been from non-retirement accounts, reflecting client\u2019s choosing the enhanced service levels provided by this offering. We saw strong fee based asset flows of $20 billion.","Higher asset levels and positive flows contributed to asset management revenues of $2.3 billion representing 5% growth relative to the first quarter. Net interest income of $1 billion was up 2% over last quarter, that benefit a higher rates and lending balances was partially offset by lower deposit levels. This reduction in deposits reflects both typical seasonal client tax payments and deployment of cash into the markets.","NII was further negatively impacted by higher prepayment amortization. Wealth management lending in the U.S. banks grew by about $3.5 billion in the quarter or 6%, as clients drew on their SPL lines to manage liquidity needs, a trend we often witnessed in the second quarter.","Year-to-date our NII of $2 billion is up approximately $340 million or 21% compared to the same period last year. While market expectations for additional rate hikes have lessened. We remain comfortable with the full-year NII guidance provided in Q1. In particular, we expect to continue to benefit from further lending risk.","Transactional revenues of $766 million were down 7% from Q1. While clients deployed cash into the market, the frequency of trading captured in brokerage accounts decreased from the previous quarter. Again, mimicking the pattern witnessed in the institutional space. Lower mark-to-market gains on our deferred compensation plans were also a driver of the sequential decrease.","Total non-interest expenses were essentially unchanged versus Q1 highlighting the operating leverage in this scale business. Lower compensation expenses were offset by seasonally higher marketing and business development and professional services expenses. The compensation ratio was below our full-year target of 56%.","Looking forward, we remain optimistic about the outlook for this business and the value of its contribution to the firm\u2019s business mix. Annuitized revenue continue to grow with fee based assets and increased loan balances. Additionally, our investments into improving our digital capabilities will enhance future productivity and provide more operating leverage to the franchise over time.","Investment management witnessed a solid quarter with strength across both asset management fees and investment results. Total net revenues were $665 million up 9% quarter-over-quarter. overall, AUM grew 3% to $435 billion driven by investment performance with particular strength across our active equity strategies. We also saw positive flows across our equities, fixed income and alternative businesses with strong capital raising internationally.","On the back of higher AUM, we saw a commensurate 4% growth in asset management fees to $539 million. Investment revenues were up 28% to a $125 million driven by gains in our infrastructure and real estate funds. Despite the 9% revenue increase, overall expenses were up only 3% quarter-over-quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis total spot assets of $841 billion were up $9 billion and average assets were up $12 billion reflecting continued support of client activities within the sales and trading businesses. Our pro forma fully phased in advance RWAs are expected to be up approximately $22 billion versus the first quarter to $381 billion driven by higher market RWAs consistent with the increase in VaR metrics over the quarter.","As a result, our pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced common equity Tier-1 ratio decreased approximately 70 basis points sequentially to 15.9% which remains in line with our pro forma fully phased in Basel III standardized common equity Tier-1 ratio. We continue to expect the two ratios to remain relatively close in the near-term. Our pro forma fully phased in supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter remained at 6.4%.","During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $500 million of common stock or approximately 12 million shares. Our tax rate in the second quarter was 32%, we continue to expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the 32% to 33% range.","This quarter\u2019s results reaffirm that our strategy is working. As James said at the outset, this quarter represented an important test of our model. Notwithstanding a challenging trading environment we achieved a 9% ROE on account of our balanced business mix and the resiliency of the franchise.","However, investors slightly remains fragile. The same questions that lingered around timing and achievability of the administration\u2019s policy initiatives at the end of the first quarter remain unresolved as we enter the third quarter. In addition, the market continues to grapple with mixed economic data and questions around the timing and pace to monitory policy tightening. This dynamic may continue to weigh on activity and sentiment in addition to typical seasonality in the summer.","At the same time, we should not lose focus on the broader macroeconomic issues that could have a materially positive impact to our business. After years of headwinds for the industry, we are finally starting to see some tailwinds that can be promising for our business in the long-term including the potential for tax reform, sensible regulatory change and a rising interest rate environment. We are confident that we will achieve our stated goals.","With that, we will open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Glenn Schorr","First question on wealth management, I noticed the deposits down 7% I think, sometimes its seasonality and then sometimes it\u2019s cash deployment. I\u2019m just curious, how you attribute some of that and also if this is late competition and what we expect on deposit data, if there are more rates hikes?","James Gorman","Sure Glenn. I think as I mentioned in the script, it was a combination of both. Clearly, we normally see in the second quarter PBT deposits going down, because of tax season. We also saw continued deployment into the markets. I don\u2019t think, we have seen a lot of deployment into other cash product. So again from a competitive dynamic, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a rate story, I just think it\u2019s an opportunity story.","We\u2019ve started a couple of quarters ago initiating some other strategies around the deposits including premier cash management product and some CD products and we\u2019ve got a couple of billion dollars in those products. So we feel good about the overall deposit franchise and the overall ability to fund that business as we continue to see growth in the asset side.","Glenn Schorr","So maybe bluntly, if we get a couple more rate hikes do you capture the majority of it - even without as us said a rate story. Do you have to hike along the way or are the clients looking to participate in that move-up?","James Gorman","I think the best indication of how we feel about that is really looking at the NII line, which is as you know has been a very good story for us. All right, back in 2012, we had a $1.6 billion of NII in wealth business, last year was $3.5 billion grew more than $500 million. In February, we talked about what we thought we would see and we thought we would continue to see good growth in the NII line, albeit at a slightly slower pace. Year-to-date were at $2 billion, which is up over $340 million over last year.","So again, we feel very confident about that story, it is reliant on the lending growth, which we saw a good growth across all the product this quarter. So we feel good about that, I think the composition is a little different, your comments about betas, generally the betas have lagged what we\u2019ve modeled. So that\u2019s been a positive, we\u2019ve also, if you go back to the first quarter, remember what the curve looked like, I think we\u2019ve gotten rate hikes faster than we thought back then.","On the other side of the ledger, you just mentioned the deposits are down. So, we brought down the liquidity pool in the banks as well as started to use other savings and deposit products as well as some wholesale funding to support that business. And then lastly, we clearly, we didn\u2019t model any pre-payment acceleration that we saw in the second quarter as rates went down. So on balance, we are very confident with where we are on NII and it\u2019s been a good story, but the composition has been a little different.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, first on [Indiscernible] really again encouraging to see the sustained stability, say that a few times - now that clearly you demonstrated some stability here after the repositioning. Has there been a shift in mix. Can you give us a sense for the different business lines now that the business has been adjusted and can you also - I know you mentioned Jon that commodities were down sequentially, but was this quarter extraordinary from your perspective we\u2019ve heard some mixed things from some of the competitors some additional color there will be great. Thanks.","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure I\u2019ll try. You know I think the way I would look at it is the results clearly just reflect the environment that we were operating in. if you look over year-over-year the results are pretty flat. So, when we look at the individual product mix, as I did mention our rates business given the low volatility is down, yet our FX did a little bit stronger particularly in the emerging market areas.","Credits were hung in there, less movement in credit spreads this quarter, but again comparable type of results in light of effected the year-over-year results were essentially flat. So we feel good about the business, commodities are also down a little bit, less activity and a tighter trading band there, but the results reflect the moves and the changes that we made and the results reflect that the business is really starting to come together and jelling and I think we feel pretty good about the results in light of the environment.","Brennan Hawken","Right. So I guess from your perspective paraphrasing you said that commodities were tough, but not necessarily extraordinarily difficult or remarkable in that way?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, listen the commodity business that we have has been totally reshaped and resized, more traditional sales and trading supporting our client base. It\u2019s a smaller contributor for us. So the movements are not that dramatic.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Your line is now open.","Steven Chubak","Good morning. So, wanted to started up with the question on wealth management and pre-tax margin, certainly encouraging to see that you guys eclipse the 25% target for the quarter. I\u2019m just wondering as we look ahead to the second half, given a number of favorable trends for the business that Jon you had cited whether it\u2019s strong fee based conversions, healthy loan growth and NII expansion. I\u2019m wondering barring any market exogenous market shocks whether you can sustain margins above that 25% target for the remainder of the year.","Jonathan Pruzan","Listen, I think you highlighted what we think is driving that margin. Right now, with the rates and higher markets those are good trends that will drive our asset base fees as well as our NII, our lending growth has been solid, I think the one area of potential volatility or softening is around transactional. We are heading into the summer months, but again, I think the tailwinds for this business are very good. We saw really nice operating leverage here, we saw really nice growth across all products in the lending book and we feel very good about the results, I mean the PBT at $1 billion plus is obviously a record and it\u2019s a really important contributor to the overall franchise.","Steven Chubak","Thanks and just one follow-up on capital. You guys had outlined a couple of the potential benefits to your business in terms of capital release that were outlined in the treasury white paper. One of the areas that\u2019s getting quite a bit of focus is this notion that the prospects for cash and liquid assets to be exquisite from the SLR denominator. And I\u2019m wondering given the Tier-1 leverage constraint in CCAR of 4% appears to be a binding constraint for the moment. It\u2019s not clear weather that carve out is going to apply to that measure. I didn\u2019t know if you had had any feedback from regulators as to whether they were considering that possibility and what that might mean for you guys in terms of capital release?","Jonathan Pruzan","On the first part of the question I think clearly the reform around SLR would be helpful for a variety of reasons whether or not it\u2019s our binding constraint this quarter or next quarter is certainly not a foregone conclusion. So there could be some benefit from that but we also think there is just general benefit with that calculation in terms of what it means for their overall sales and trading businesses. But I do think there are several changes have been discussed or that are being discussed that would clearly help our position including around the balance sheet and how you think about capital actions going forward.","So I think it\u2019s a little early on 2018 CCAR to sort of have a prediction, but clearly we were pleased with the results, if you look back at year ago where we were versus what came out of the report a couple of weeks ago with a 100%ish payout and a 33% increase in capital return and a clean report we\u2019re very pleased.","James Gorman","I would just add on the leverage ratio, specifically, we have argued for a number of years and present to regulators for a number of years that the fact that a balance sheet growth during the time of financial stress is hard to understand how that happens. As such depreciate assets run off, new businesses not gathered, it would be hard to imagine in fact during the crisis in the years following of our own balance sheet obviously shrink dramatically both through our actions and through market activity.","So the leverage ratio constraint is made more acute by the fact that the denominator is growing at I think it\u2019s about 4.5% a year for the nine quarters. There being quite a lot of sympathy to that view that if we should look not at some blanket growth rate, but what actually experience was during the crisis and during other periods of financial stress. And I think that experience would largely hold up the balance sheet shrink.","So if you just held our balance sheet flat for that time period, that would have a material impact on our leverage ratio. So I think there is certainly a good dialogue going on through the treasury white paper and with the regulators on that topic alone.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Guy Moszkowski","Good morning. Just looking at the VaR and the [indiscernible] metrics, which you talked about and floated up on average basis, I guess it\u2019s about an 8%, depending on which one you look at. So could you give us a sense for given that those are average daily I guess metrics. What we look like at on a spot basis towards the end of the quarter, should we be expecting that these things will close down again?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. A couple of things. So on the VaR metric, obviously the 51 million was the average for the quarter. If you have queue, it was actually 57 at period end at March 31. So that actually came down overtime and it has actually continue to come down and the spot period end will be lower than the 51 that we said.","On the RWA comments, actually some of the calculations are daily average volumes, some of them 12-week averages. And the VaR metrics are important in those calculations. So I think the same trend that we\u2019ve seen in the VaR would be consistent in terms of how we finished out quarter end in that metrics. With the ratio that we have at CET1 even at the 16 or 59 level, we\u2019re still obviously very, very strong in terms of our capital positions.","Guy Moszkowski","Great that\u2019s helpful. And then just my follow-up question is more targeted on SIC. Specifically given the success that you have had in generating revenue even in a period like the one that we just had which was certainly weaker characterize by low vol, et cetera on the things that you have said. Would you consider raising your quarterly average expectation from that $1 billion number that you\u2019ve been talking about for quite a while now?","James Gorman","Guy, I\u2019m surprise, it took somebody this many questions to get to let\u2019s trace the targets discussion. We just went on the pre-tax margin a few questions ago. I think the short answer you know and it\u2019s no. We\u2019ve been pretty consistent, we took these targets for proof of business model for this year. We\u2019re going to stay with them. We think, listen, we were - recall certain fourth quarter 2015, we were doing 500 million and 600 million in SIC first quarter of 2016, I think if memory serves its about 800 million.","A billion dollar number on a study run rate basis is a good number with 25% less people much smaller organization, much more focused organization. If we consistently do better than that and that\u2019s terrific. But I don\u2019t think, the point of setting the target to establish, what we needed to prove to ourselves on an average run rate for the business to justify the expenses in capital balance sheet that we put behind it at that level. Everything we do better than that with the same expenses capital and balance sheet is obviously a gift.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Jim Mitchell","Good morning. Maybe a follow-up in the SLR and the treasury report. If we assume that both the Tier-1 leverage ratio and the SLR treated similarly by exempting cash and maybe short-term treasuries. How do you think that impacts the business, I guess, I think a lot of people are asking the question of? Is this a revenue opportunity to kind of re-expand the business whether it would be REPO or other businesses or is it really more of an excess capital story. Just trying to get a sense of, if you think business has been held back by the SLR?","James Gorman","Let me tell start with and Jon might want to add to it. First and foremost this is a capital question. We believe, we are over capitalized. There were good reasons for that several years ago as we were coming out of those financial crisis, we had a dividend of $0.05 a quarter, we\u2019ve raised that four years in a row to $0.25. Our initial buyback program was zero then went to $500 and it\u2019s now all the way up to $5 billion over five year period. And our payout ratio is closing in on 100%. So we clearly believe that we are over capitalized and for good reasons we were coming off the crisis and we needed to shore up our defenses.","There is plenty of opportunity for business expansion with the amount of capital we have today. The more fundamental issue is what is the right level of capital this firm should hold. Are we holding too much capital, because the way the leverage ratio is being constructed, what is the right denominator for the SLR, in fact what is the right ratio. In Europe it\u2019s 3% of the balance sheet and that the growth of balance sheet. In the U.S. they took the [indiscernible] balance sheet ratio of 5% and attached it to this SLR balance sheet from Europe. So we sort of ended up with a fairly [draconian] (Ph) answer.","I think let\u2019s start with number one, if the trades in other type securities can be taken out of the SLR that obviously make sense. Number two, to not gross up the balance sheet under the core leverage ratio make sense. And I think we have capacity at that point both for further capital distributions and for sensible business growth. You saw the RWAs bounce a little bit this quarter, that was consistent with sensible business growth, there was opportunity clearly Tier-1 capital ratio is another constraint or no way near it. So that\u2019s the RWA constraint is not there for this firm at the moment.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe as a follow-up on just the treasury report generally. Is there any other aspects of the proposals that you would be particularly helpful for your business?","James Gorman","I\u2019m trying to remember all the aspects of the report, but I actually can\u2019t do off the top of my head. I think clearly, I think there is a general recognition from the regulators all the way through the treasury that the Volcker Rule as it play out overtime straight a fair bit distance from Paul Walker initially envisaged, which was a simple restriction on the amount of capital put into proprietary invest and proprietary trading and but then frankly constrained on the ability of institutions to make markets and effective market liquidity. So I think the treasury reports spoke about that.","There was reference to the fact that the banks are required to continue their payouts, not withstanding there in the period of financial stress for nine quarters, no bank board would authorize continuing on buyback program during a financial crisis, that clearly wouldn\u2019t happen. You could holding the dividends static, but certainly the buyback shouldn\u2019t be and that would have material effect on the institutions.","So our approach has been and we\u2019ve talked about this somewhat publicly recently, let\u2019s focus on a few things that don\u2019t require major legislative change, let\u2019s see the basic architecture of Dodd-Frank in place. Let\u2019s focus on some sensible changes, because we\u2019ve now had eight years of experience and digest and see what worked and what didn\u2019t. And the cumulative effect of a lot of these regulations in some cases end up if you will with a double counting. And I think the spirit of the treasury report reflected that. I think they are focused on sensible pragmatic change, they are not focused on trying to redo the whole legislative agenda. And I think that\u2019s the right approach.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Devin Ryan","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe first here just in wealth management, you\u2019ve recently outlined the digitalization strategy, which was very helpful and with respect to the [robo] (Ph) offering, it sounds like you\u2019re not going to be able to focus on the children of the existing clients and some lower balance accounts which does seem to mark us with this generation of wealth transfer coming here and where the money is going to be over the next several decades. So as we think about that process, how do you protect against maybe some cannibalization of existing business as clients look at the lower price point. You know I guess the question is a revenue opportunity here just much more of an offset or do you just not think this as something that would appeal to some of your existing higher net worth clients for a portion of their accounts, it\u2019s a just a different bucket.","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, I think that your description of what we\u2019re doing on the digitalization and the robo strategies is pretty accurate. Listen, we have a business that is built to cater to clients with wealth. Those wealth clients want advice, they want personal advice, we\u2019re seeing it as we see the brokerage fee base flows coming out of brokerage into the fee based accounts. Obviously digital is going to be an important part of that strategy, but the digital only client is not someone right now that would generally be interested in the types of products and services that we have.","We think the digital strategy is going to be important for both revenue opportunities longer term but also optimization and efficiency around what happens in a branch and how we free up people\u2019s time to spend more time with their clients. So overall it\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s going to be built for the longer term but the thesis of our business is around providing people with personnel advice around their wealth and their planning.","James Gorman","I would just like to add to that because it\u2019s an important question. We actually saw this maybe once before in 1999 when the direct players came out and the big fear was cannibalization. That would only have held true if people actually didn\u2019t value the financial advisors and advice that we\u2019re getting from those advisors. And it didn\u2019t play out that way. The reality is the marketplace has different segments based on consumer preference and I think the digital strategy makes all the sense in the world. That\u2019s clearly a segment whether they change their behavior as they become wealthy remains to be seen. But there is clearly a segment that wants to deal digitally just as so the segment that wanted to deal through direct brokerage trading and so on.","But on the price sensitivity, it\u2019s interesting, I think I\u2019m right in this. If you look at the average basis points paid from the various robo platforms, they range in general like things from something like 20 to 40 basis points. If you look at the average basis points for a full service advisory like us, just divide our revenue into our assets including everything, you get somewhere in the 70s, low 70 basis points. So the value added of the financial buys and the institutions behind it and the research, the product offering, the new issued calendar you could argue is being putout there for 30 to 40 basis points.","It\u2019s not clear to me that, that is such an expensive gap that that\u2019s going to lead to the cannibalization issues. I think it\u2019s more that we just need a very compelling digital platform to deal with clients who want to deal with Morgan Stanley, but want to deal with us digitally and don\u2019t want to deal through a traditional wealth management advisory relationship. That\u2019s an exciting opportunity for us, frankly given our brand and add technology capabilities.","Devin Ryan","Okay, great. That\u2019s great color, looking forward to seeing it. Maybe an equity is trading here, we\u2019re six months away or within six months of method to in Europe I\u2019m sure there is lot of corporation at the firm right now. So just curious with respect to expectations there, is this something that you feel like it will weigh on the research fee pool, but you\u2019ll pick it up in trading market share or just Morgan Stanley is going to take market share of the overall equities pool. I\u2019m just curious kind of how you would frame your expectations right now, this is we\u2019re getting pretty close to be implementation?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. Well, I think, as you know, we\u2019ve been preparing for a while both in terms of dialogues with clients, but also systems and technology related investments that we needed to make. But I would tell you, it\u2019s going to be very hard to estimate what the impact of this is. Any time you have a change of this magnitude where you just sort of flip a switch. We would expect the potential for disruption to be pretty high, how would affects longer term structural markets, it\u2019s still up in the air, we\u2019ve global clients to already doing this.","We have global clients, so we\u2019re going to probably adopt it in all the markets. Even though, we don\u2019t expected to be adopted in the U.S., we have some clients [indiscernible] off that European operation. So how it all plays out is certainly unclear. But given the fact that we are number one in the world in this business and we have a full service platform and intellectual capital and product. There is consolidation in a number of counter parties. We would expect to participate in that, but I think it\u2019s a little early to make a call here and trying to estimate the impact is also probably a little early to make a call.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open.","Chris Kotowski","Yes. I mean recognizing the excellent outcome that you had in the CCAR capital return process. I have to say, I was surprised a week before, when the DFAS results came out that, that still shows Morgan Stanley has been severely impacted by the severely adverse scenario. That said, the booklet shows you losing 8.4 percentage points of capital and against the median of 2.8. And given all you\u2019ve done and de-risking your balance sheet. I would have thought that we would have seen more progress in that and can you tell us what it is in the fed methodology that seems to cut against you, so disproportionally?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, we were very pleased with the results. We had the same issue last year around DFAS and people sort of concerned with our outcome and about 100% payout ratio continue to increased capital return, part of our core strategy. We clearly have de-risked the balance sheet or RWA density is lower and basically every other firm out there, which is why you see some of that disparaging percentages. If you look at the leverage base ratio, as you get a slighter different picture. We clearly had de-risk, we\u2019ve got and you\u2019ve seen that through the dollar amount of losses that we\u2019ve seen over the last several years have come down.","We have met our strategic objective of increasing capital return. We still think we\u2019re capital sufficient. When we came out in January of 2016 with that statement. We said, we were capital sufficient, we did not want to grow our equity base, we have grown our equity base a couple of billion dollars, but we\u2019ve also supported our businesses and grown our balance sheet by $50 billion. So we\u2019ve increased capital return and we\u2019ve increased the size of the balance sheet and we feel very comfortable with our capital position.","James Gorman","Chris, we don\u2019t have complete excess to the fed models as I think you know. The construction of operating risk capital, the various stress falls that are in there, counter party risks, how the trading book is managed, how you derive your PP&I, there is a hell of lot of stuff that goes into this. Our own submission was 45,000 pages. And frankly looking back at this point, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be very valuable. The regulators and treasury are all focused on how to make both the models more transparent, the process more transparent and to make some sensible adjustments for it.","So honestly I may not to be equipped about it, but I sort of don\u2019t care what the past was. What I do care is that our distribution this year approved to is about $6.8 billion and five years ago it was $400 million. So let\u2019s start with that one and number two, let\u2019s see what changes comes through, we may all be pleasantly surprised, we may be in the same place we\u2019re in, but we\u2019re operating now currently with about 100% pass. So I would let this one play out a little bit and see what comes out of the treasury efforts.","Chris Kotowski","Okay. And I mean I guess the thing is right, just again if you look at the old way of doing it right, if you need at five, after the stress then you were losing eight or nine and you need one for a margin of safety that would suggest you need to see T1 ratio on a 14%, 15% on an operating basis, I mean is there an outlook for like operating at less than that?","James Gorman","I think you are torturing yourself by looking it backwards. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t do it. Focus on the big picture here. The big picture is, we distributed $400 million five years ago, we\u2019re distributing $6.8 billion now and there\u2019s the full review of the whole capital process being undertaken right now.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Your line is now open.","Andrew Lim","Hi there. Can I foresee a bit more new claim of excess capital? As things currently spanned [Indiscernible] scenario and that\u2019s 3.2% slightly up to 3% minimum. So you\u2019re maxing out your capital return here. You came with excess capital as contingent on changes kind of true form the treasury or as you say the fed being more lenient on how do you guys leverage [Indiscernible] stress scenario. And so I mean can you give a bit more color on that?","James Gorman","I\u2019m really not sure what else I can say. We have consistently increased that capital payouts while the tests become consistently more severe, we\u2019re now at a 100% payouts, by definition, any excess capital we have and gating constraint was the leverage ratio this year and we were above the gating constraint after we did our distribution, so by definition we are carrying excess capital.","And our view is that, the way we calculate our capital needs to run our business, we continue to have excess above that, but we\u2019re waiting for the outcome of the white paper and the various efforts from the regulators to see what changes take place, there are clearly going to be changes. How favorable they are and to what extent they fit Morgan Stanley remains to be seen is not going to be productive to try and guess that.","Andrew Lim","Right. Understood. And just a follow up question. [Indiscernible] background we haven\u2019t heard anything like that for a long time now. But [indiscernible] when you might get some disclosure of the impact on capital ratios or the timing?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, I don\u2019t think we have much more visibility than anyone else in this area. I think the thing that sometimes people fail to recognize is we obviously have this white paper and if you think about it, we are actually going to enter a period of refinement and adjustment to regulations versus where we were a year ago, where our expectation was incremental regulation for periods of periods of periods of time to come, we\u2019re clearly going to be in a better place. Now how that plays out and what timeframe and what the actual changes are, it\u2019s very hard to predict, but we are clearly entering a different period going forward that we have been in the last eight years.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Gerrard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Gerrard Cassidy","Thank you, good morning. Can you guys share with us once we get into a more normalized return on capital environment that we see in the future. What kind of dividend payout ratio are you guys comfortable with as we look further out?","James Gorman","You know I don\u2019t think it probably serves us well to get a head of that discussion with the regulators and others. I think the current regulatory environment anticipates for the G-Sifi banks at payout ratios of something like 30% and for some of the smaller institutions I think they\u2019ve gone higher than that maybe up to 40%. Whether that changes, you know post all the work being done, I don\u2019t know we\u2019re not at the 30% of this point. I think we\u2019re close to it.","So one way to think about our business which is I thought about it for a while the wealth management business is almost like a yield stock. So you can imagine the dividend coming out of wealth management earnings and obviously the institutional businesses are more volatile overtime. So they are more capital distribution businesses or capital investment businesses. But I don\u2019t know Gerrard that we want to change what the targets that are currently being given to us by regulators.","Gerrard Cassidy","Okay, great. And then second in the supplement package, on page five you give us the total loans of the organization. And could you share with us some color on - I may have missed this I apologize if I did. Why the corporate loans were down 37% or so year-over-year and a little color behind that really good growth you\u2019re seeing around the wealth management side where those loans are up 20%.","Jonathan Pruzan","I\u2019m just flipping to page five, give me a second here. Okay, I think the changes in the corporate book are really around the size of the event book in sort of the event activity as well as some just overall management of the relationship book. The real story for us is as you mentioned has been in the wealth business as we continue to increase the penetration of our client base with lending products. The growth has been very good across all of our three core products the SPL, the mortgage and tailored lending.","And we feel like we\u2019ve got good momentum in the growth last quarter at $3.5 billion was pretty balanced across the business a little bit more skewed towards SPL and tailored versus mortgage given what happened in rates, but again that lending story we feel very good about, our levels of penetration of how many of our clients have lending products is still probably a bit below peer level. So we expect or feel good about the ability to continue to grow that and that\u2019s been a real key driver to our wealth business.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities. Your line is open.","Christopher Wheeler","Yes, good morning. A couple of questions on wealth management. I think during the quarter we\u2019ve had the news that I think yourself and couple of your big competitors are now stepping back from filing away experience financial advisors and obviously in doing obviously reducing the cost of amortizing the [indiscernible] senior producers. I would like to perhaps understand how that perhaps progressing, how you\u2019re getting on with that because obviously it\u2019s a big change. And then perhaps to sort of link it up with the end of the Smith Barney payouts and talk about what you think this might do to your pre-tax margin, because I think at one said you say it might add, once a Smith Barney payouts retention packages run out, I mean, next year. You might be adding 1.5% percentage points deal your pre-tax margin. So a bit of color there would be helpful. Thank you.","Jonathan Pruzan","I\u2019ll go first on the second part of your question, which is the retention payments conclude in first quarter of 2019. Obviously, it\u2019s a function of numerator and denominator, but 1.5% increase is a reasonable approximation and obviously that will drop directly to the bottom-line. In terms of the attrition in the recruiting that we\u2019ve seen is clearly slowdown and that is obviously helpful both in terms of just ins and outs. The expense associated would bring in new FAs, but also when a FA leads generally they\u2019re book goes with them or a good chunk of their book goes with them. So just lower levels of recruiting and lower levels of attrition has been overall helpful to the business.","Christopher Wheeler","And when you just want to decide whether do you think your competitor is holding the line, but it does seem like the beneficial move, but there are one or two players out there, of course, still sort of quite came take away some of your senior people?","James Gorman","Listen, these are big organizations. Our major competitors each have, I don\u2019t know 10,000 to 15,000, 16,000 advisors. if you have 1% attrition that\u2019s three-people a week. So it\u2019s not like going to have movement, you\u2019ll always have moment Chris. I think what\u2019s changed structurally with the industry is frankly, there are fewer competitors, if you think Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley is now a composites that includes Dean Witter Reynolds & Company, Robinson, Humphrey, Legg Mason, Smith Barney, Shearson, Hutton. And probably some that I\u2019m missing, all of which use to compete against each of it, recruit against each of it.","So it\u2019s a consolidated industry, the big and small films continue to recruit, there are fewer numbers, all that I think the deal structures have become shall I say more sensible, there was a bit of a crazy period there. So, yes, but there will always be some recruiting and that make sense to many people ever right to getting work whether want to work.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your line is now open.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay thanks. Maybe just a first question on equity sales and trading. I think this is probably third or fourth quarter now, you called out strength and time broker. As a driver of those revenues, can you maybe give us a little bit more color as to what\u2019s driving that strength? Is it by region, is it existing clients more active, is it client growth?","Jonathan Pruzan","The simple answer is yes to all of those. Very strong quarter, the growth was across all of the regions, particularly stand out being EMEA, given some of seasonality there. Balances are up, we continue to invest in the balance sheet. And so, again it\u2019s been a very good story for quite some time, it\u2019s the full service platform and our clients have been very responsive to that.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And then second question, can you give us an update on kind of where the banking pipeline stand especially for M&A, it seems like there is been pick-up and activity thus far early in the third quarter, I mean how does the pipeline stand at the end of the second quarter versus first quarter?","Jonathan Pruzan","I would say that, first of all its very early in the third quarter, point number one. I would say that\u2019s a IBD pipeline, it\u2019s clearly healthy into the third quarter. I think if we look specifically advisory, it\u2019s probably down slightly. But overall, the equity and, debt underwriting remains healthy. IPOs backlog is healthy and broad and activities picked up really nicely here. So again a healthy environment. We are going into the summer months, so we\u2019ll have to see how that impacts us as well as all of the sort of policy uncertainty, uncertainty that we talked about in the past. But right now, pretty healthy.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. That concludes the program, and you may all disconnect.

This is Kathleen McCabe, Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.","The presentation may also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings at www.morganstanley.com for a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley. This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Office James Gorman.","James Gorman","Thank you, Kathleen, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on what is the last earnings call from our favorite CFO, Ruth Porat. I will now give you some highlights for the first quarter results and mark to market our execution against the strategic plan that we provided an update of in January.","We begin this year on a solid footing with all businesses contributing to our performance. Excluding DVA, this was the strongest quarter in firm revenue and PBT in many years. In fact, it was the second best quarter in revenue, ex-DVA, in the firm's 80 year history.","Key highlights include the following. Equity showed continued leadership. We delivered strong performance across products and regions both quarter over quarter and year over year. Fixed income delivered a stronger quarter consistent with our strategy.","Investment Banking performed solidly and the pipeline remains healthy. Wealth Management achieved record revenue, record revenue per financial advisor and delivered a pretax margin of 22%. Investment Management results were steady but there's more to be done as this business remains an important part of our growth opportunity.","Most significantly we took a meaningful step toward achieving our state of return on equity target, delivering in this quarter an ROE of 10.1%. This ROE excludes the affect of the net discrete tax benefit and DVA. On a reported basis, as you'll have seen, the ROE for the quarter was actually 14.2%. This performance reflects our strategic plan and demonstrates the business' flexibility to respond to increased client activity and market movements.","While the firm has clearly made progress, there remains work to be done in achieving the six-point plan we laid out in January. An update of which I'll briefly provide today. First, we continue to improve our wealth management margin, which reached 22% for the quarter. The business is also benefiting from additional factors described during our last call.","Secondly, we'll continue to execute on our bank strategy through deploying our deposits and again delivering prudent loan growth across Wealth Management and institutional securities.","Third, fixed income and commodities saw its strongest revenue quarter in three years, as volumes returned to the market with increased volatility. This quarter was important evidence of the execution of our strategy to significantly reduce the capital required to support the fixed income business, while maintaining the appropriately sized global footprint to meet our client\u2019s needs. Needless to say, we must see this play out for more than one quarter.","Fourth, we're just beginning to realize the benefit of lower funding costs as we refinance the debt post crisis. This provides us with a tailwind across the businesses. We maintained our focus on expense management discipline and showed strong progress in the first quarter, delivering an overall expense ratio of 72%, excluding DVA. This level reflects an Institutional Securities compensation ratio of 38% and that ratio is consistent with our stated target of being at or below 39%.","Finally, with respect to steadily increasing capital returns to shareholders, we were pleased to receive a non-objection from the Federal Reserve on our 2015 capital plan to increase our dividend to $0.15 per quarter and a repurchase up to $3.1 billion of common stock for the five quarters beginning in the second quarter of this year.","We hope to maintain this trend of increasing dividends and share repurchases in future cycles, subject of course to regulatory approval. In aggregate, we continue to execute against the benchmarks previously established and will remain focused on them for the duration of 2015.","Before closing I would like to note several organization changes we recently made. These changes, where we moved executives across the firm, reflect our strong desire to build a very deep bench of senior management for the years ahead. And finally, I would like to thank our CFO Ruth Porat for her partnership, friendship and commitment to Morgan Stanley and to me personally.","She has been an extraordinarily highly valued part of my team for the five years and a tremendous asset to this firm since her arrival. We indeed have been lucky to have her. We are delighted to appoint as CFO, Jon Pruzan, a 20 year veteran of our investment banking division at the end of this month, and I wish John luck in this new role.","I will now turn the call over to Ruth to discuss the quarter in detail.","Ruth Porat","Thank you, James, and good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures.","Results for the first-quarter include a net discrete tax benefit of $564 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, primarily associated with the repatriation of non-US earnings at a lower cost than originally estimated. In addition, the impact of DVA in the quarter was a positive $125 million, with $100 million in fixed income sales and trading and $25 million in equity sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were $9.8 billion, up 30% versus the fourth quarter.","Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders, excluding DVA, were $2.2 billion. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share, excluding DVA, were $1.14 after preferred dividends.","On a GAAP basis, including the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues for the quarter were $9.9 billion. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $2.3 billion.","Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $1.18 after preferred dividends. Reported return on equity from continuing operations was 14.2% in the first quarter, excluding both DVA and the net discrete tax benefit, our ROE for the quarter was 10.1%. Book value at the end of the quarter was $33.80 per share and tangible book value was $28.91 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $829 billion at March 31, up from $802 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Deposits as of quarter end were $136 billion, up $2 billion versus Q4. Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $195 billion, compared with $193 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.","Turning to capital. Although our calculations are not final, our common equity tier 1 transitional ratio will be approximately 13.1% and our tier 1 capital ratio under this regime will be approximately 14.7%.","Basel III transitional risk weighted assets are expected to be approximately $440 billion at March 31. Reflecting our best estimate of the final Federal Reserve rules, our pro forma common equity tier 1 ratio using the Basel III, fully phased-in advanced approach was 11.6% at March 31, up from 10.7% in the fourth quarter.","Our pro forma standardized ratio was 11.6%, up from 10.9% in the fourth quarter. Pro forma, fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $449 billion. Pro forma, fully phased-in Basel III standardized RWAs are expected to be approximately $446 billion.","We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the US final rule to be approximately 5.1% at March 31, up from 4.7% at the end of 4Q. All of these estimates are preliminary and are subject to revision.","Turning to expenses. Our total expenses this quarter were $7.1 billion, down 34% versus the fourth quarter. Compensation expense was $4.5 billion in the quarter, down 11%, driven primarily by the change in compensation structure discussed in the fourth quarter, partly offset by increased compensation related to higher revenue.","Non-compensation expense was $2.5 billion for the quarter, down 55% quarter over quarter driven by decreased legal expense as well as continued expense discipline.","Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, revenues excluding DVA were $5.3 billion, up 45% sequentially after excluding the implementation charge for FDA in 4Q. Non-interest expense was $3.6 billion, down 49% versus the fourth quarter due to legal expenses and the compensation expense adjustment occurred in the prior quarter.","Compensation expense was $2 billion for the first quarter, down 17% versus the fourth quarter reflecting the impact of the change in compensation structure I just noted.","Excluding DVA, the compensation ratio was 38%, down quarter over quarter and down approximately 300 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the change in compensation structure and operating leverage in the business.","Non-compensation expense was $1.6 billion, down 65% versus the fourth quarter, driven by significantly lower legal expense in the quarter. Including the impact of DVA, revenues were $5.5 billion.","In investment banking, revenues of $1.2 billion were down - last quarter. According to Thomson-Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked at number one in global IPOs and number three in global equity and global announced M&A at the end of the first quarter. Notable transactions included, in advisory Morgan Stanley acted as sole financial advisor to AbbVie in its acquisition of Pharmacyclics for an aggregate value of $20 billion. AbbVie obtained financing for Morgan Stanley and MUFG.","In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley as joint global coordinator, lead left book runner and stabilization agents, priced a $3.7 billion follow-on offering for Citizens Financial Group. This was the largest financial institutions follow-on offering since 2012. In debt underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as active book runner for Coca-Cola in its EUR8.5 billion senior unsecured notes, offering the largest euro transaction for a US issuer on record and the second largest euro transaction of all time.","Advisory revenues of $471 million decreased 3% versus our fourth-quarter results, driven by lower revenues in EMEA and Asia. Underwriting revenues of $702 million decreased 13% versus our fourth quarter results, driven by equity underwriting revenues of $307 million, down 11% versus 4Q reflecting fewer IPOs and lower revenues from EMEA and Asia.","Fixed income underwriting revenues of $395 million, down 15% versus the fourth quarter, primarily due to decreases in non-investment grade loans and high-yield bonds that more than offset increases in investment grade activity.","Equity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $2.3 billion, up 40% compared to last quarter. Results reflected broad-based gains across products and regions. Cash equities saw increased volume and share gain. Derivatives revenues were higher across regions. Prime brokerage revenues increased, driven by an uptick in balances and client activity.","Fixed income and commodities sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $1.9 billion, up significantly versus the fourth quarter. Commodities results were up meaningfully versus the fourth quarter, benefiting from structured transactions, improved client flow and extreme weather.","Fixed Income revenues increased quarter over quarter driven by increased contribution across regions, with particular strength in macro products and EMEA. Average trading VaR for the first quarter was $47 million, flat to the fourth quarter.","Turning to wealth management. Revenues were $3.8 billion in the first quarter, up 1% sequentially. Asset management revenues of $2.1 billion were relatively flat with the last quarter.","Transaction revenues were down 3% compared to last quarter consisting primarily of commissions of $526 million, down 8% to the prior quarter driven in part by fewer trading days as well as activity levels.","Investment banking related fees of $192 million, up 11% versus last quarter primarily reflecting a revenue-sharing arrangement with Institutional Securities related to municipal securities. And trading revenues of $232 million, a slight uptick versus the fourth quarter. Net interest revenue increased 10% to $689 million, driven primarily by investment portfolio returns as well as continued growth in lending products.","Non-interest expense was $3 billion, down 3% versus last quarter. Non-compensation expense was $754 million, down 3% from last quarter. Compensation expense was $2.2 billion, down 3% versus the fourth quarter, in part due to the change in compensation structure last quarter as well as a revenue mix change, with growth in non-compensable revenues this quarter.","The compensation ratio was 58%, down versus the fourth quarter. The TBT margin was 22%, profit before tax was $855 million. Total client assets were $2 trillion. Global fee-based asset inflows were $13.3 billion, fee-based assets under management increased to $803 billion at quarter end, representing 39% of client assets.","Global representatives were 15,915, down 1% to the fourth quarter. Deposits in our bank deposit program were $135 billion, down $3 billion versus the fourth quarter. Approximately $130 billion were held in Morgan Stanley banks. Wealth management lending balances continued to grow, reflecting the ongoing execution of our bank strategy.","Investment management revenues of $669 million were up 14% sequentially. In traditional asset management, revenues of $439 million were up 2% versus the fourth quarter. In Merchant Banking and real estate investing, revenues of $230 million were up compared with the fourth quarter driven by higher investment gain.","Non-interest expenses were $482 million, down 19% from the fourth quarter due to the change in compensation structure discussed last quarter.","Compensation expense was $273 million in the quarter reflecting a compensation ratio of 41%. Non-compensation expense was $209 million, down 2% from the fourth quarter. Profit before tax was $187 million in the first quarter. NCI was $17 million versus $12 million last quarter. Total assets under management increased to $406 billion driven by market appreciation.","Turning now to our outlook. In the first quarter the firm benefited from growing investor and corporate interest in global opportunities, with higher activity levels in the US complemented by a meaningful pickup in activity in Europe and Asia.","In investment banking, the M&A backlog is higher than a year ago, supported by the trends we have discussed previously; robust cross-border activity, activism and larger transactions across industries.","The underwriting pipeline similarly remains healthy, increasingly driven by acquisition activity. In sales and trading, we continue to benefit from the breadth of our strong, global franchise with renewed client interest in European and Asian markets, reflecting the varying stages of global recovery and the impact of central bank actions across product. The obvious factors that affect these results going forward are global events and the nature of volatility.","Our Wealth Management clients remain well engaged with their financial advisors. The key catalyst for higher activity is the level of US new issue activity, with the pipeline up versus Q1. Q1 levels also reflected client caution in anticipation of Federal Reserve rate moves which should play out throughout the year.","We are pleased to have achieved this starting point of our 22% to 25% margin target in a lower transaction environment, underscoring the great operating leverage in this business.","The outlook for our bank remains strong given the lending pipeline in our wealth management and institutional securities businesses. This enables us to continue to benefit from earnings upside, even without the benefit of rising rates.","Our goal with the roadmap we introduced several years ago was to address your many questions and be transparent through metrics and goalposts, so that our progress could be measured.","We had early confidence that the transformation of Morgan Stanley's business and balance sheet would deliver returns to all of our stakeholders, and I am proud that the levers we articulated are increasingly evident.","Beyond the business outlook we expect to benefit from lower funding costs and the impact of capital returns to shareholders. Although the path to a sustainable acceptable ROE is not a straight line from here, I am confident that the road is a clear one.","I will miss working with you and I'm grateful for the strong support and for the analysts on the call for your very constructive guidance and analysis. Thank you. It was a privilege to be in this role at this moment in Morgan Stanley's history. I thank my partner and boss, James Gorman, for the opportunity, but far more important for what our great team has accomplished.","We will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski","Good morning, Ruth and James.","Ruth Porat","Good morning.","James Gorman","Morning.","Guy Moszkowski","First question I guess, is if you could give us a little bit more color on fixed income and commodities. Given that it seems like you've had a pretty high hurdle to deal with commodities not only having done well in the first quarter of last year, but also you having sold TransMontaigne.","Can you give us a little bit more color on how you managed to see revenue there actually up year-on-year?","Ruth Porat","Certainly. We had strong contribution from around the globe. Strength in EMEA across products with meaningfully higher client volumes. The bigger driver was strength in macro rates and FX were up nicely year over year; and, importantly, that's not withstanding a meaningfully lower balance sheet, and RWAs and fixed income were also lower; they were actually at $174 billion.","So through our target, we're keeping our target at $108 billion; but this really goes to what we've talked about over many quarters. Our focus is on centralized resource management, so nice performance there.","Credit was up from a weak fourth quarter, although not at last year's levels. And then as you noted in commodities, Q1 is seasonally strong. And even with the sale of TMG, TransMontaigne, in last year's results we were up. And the performance was across the board. It was physical client flows, structured transactions for clients. So we saw strength across the board there.","Guy Moszkowski","Are you still looking to sell those storage and other physical businesses?","Ruth Porat","Well, as you've heard us say many times, we're committed to selling oil merchanting; and we'll let you know when we have something to say.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. Great. And maybe a little bit of color on the reduction in the RWA in thick in the quarter. Can you give us a sense for how much of that was from runoff of some of the legacy positions that you've talked about in the past that don't generate revenue?","Ruth Porat","So included both active and passive mitigation. There was some benefit from market move as well. It was really all three.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. That's helpful. And then final question on moves in the capital account. There's a lot of moving parts it seems like this quarter. We know that overall capital was kind of flat. But we can see in the average allocations that you provide that you moved or retained more capital in the institutional securities business.","And I was wondering if you could give us a little sense for, given the RWA movement, what's going on there?","Ruth Porat","So, you actually answered in your question. There were some ins and outs. But obviously given it is an average calculation, there are timing implications that flow through. And you can see, therefore, more capital moved up to ISG.","Guy Moszkowski","So we shouldn't necessarily expect that to remain in ISG as we move through the quarters of the year or is there something to do with continued regulatory changes that would drive those capital levels a little bit higher?","Ruth Porat","Well, over time it will. I mean, the required capital calculation is based on the capital regime in place today at any point time. So that does continue to be on a transitional basis. Over time, you'll see a reduction in some of the phased introductions.","So it will change over time, and more of that parent capital would be allocated across the businesses, but more of it going to ISG over time. But of course, that's a couple year period on the phase in.","Guy Moszkowski","Got it. Okay. Thanks very much for taking the questions and obviously for your service and your tremendous clarity of vision and explanation of everything over the last several years. We've appreciated working with you.","Ruth Porat","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Hi. First question for James. You have a 10% ROE target. You certainly achieved that in the first quarter. What is your target time frame to achieve the 10% ROE for the year?","James Gorman","Well, Mike, first of all, appreciate you noting the first quarter. We have, as you know, resisted giving you a formal time frame because obviously, the ROE is an output and it's a function of returns, both revenue and expenses, as well as it is of capital accretive over time and what our capital plans are. So we have resisted trying to put a formal date on it.","I can assure you everybody in this building would want it sooner rather than later. And the fact that we achieved it in a good environment but not an extraordinary environment in the first quarter and before many of the tailwinds that we have behind us are fully baked in, was very comforting.","We're not going to give you a formal date on this. We are intent on achieving a 10% ROE year over year and beyond that in the outgoing years. So we're off to a good start here in 2015, and let's hope we keep it up.","Mike Mayo","What is the 10.1% on a tangible basis?","James Gorman","It's 11.9, is that right Ruth?","Ruth Porat","Yes it is. Various numbers are we reported 14.2% translates to 16.6% on tangible. And so adjusting up for DVA and discrete tax benefits, equivalent ROTE rate of 11.9%.","Mike Mayo","And then a separate question. Your VaR stayed flatten from the fourth quarter when your VaR peers actually went up. What's your thought process there, did you leave money on the table, is that a lower risk profile? What's going on?","Ruth Porat","So, VaR is heavily weighted to changes in current market volatility. And as you know our VaR was flat, but what we're focused on is our VaR was flat on performance. We were very active with clients. We were able to achieve VaR efficiency. We reduced balance sheet in certain areas that were less constructive. We reallocated by client activity.","We have capacity to take VaR up. But you can see in the results, we had strong performance with flat VaR.","James Gorman","I think the key to this is we did not dial up risk to generate these earnings. Whether we left money on the table if things had turned out differently, some people might have said we left losses on the table. In this situation, we didn't dial up the risk. We delivered the earnings.","But obviously we have a very successful trading business in parts of this firm. And they will react to the market volatility as I said.","Mike Mayo","And then lastly, Ruth, you're yet one more banking executive to lead the industry. Any last comment about the regulation in the banking industry?","Ruth Porat","Well, I think that fundamental regulatory change was needed with the backdrop of 2008, and it was implemented. And I think there's been meaningful improvement in the stability and resiliency of the industry as a result with all that's been done. The higher capital levels, liquidity stress testing, recovery plans, resolution plans, governance -- all the changes in business activity.","I think if I look back over the last five years, some made those changes kicking and screaming. I think we were of the view that it was clear where it was going and it was needed and are proud of the changes we've made.","I think at this point given how much has been accomplished, it is time to pause, digest and assess. It will be good to have a timeout and see the impact on markets and see where there was an undershoot and an overshoot. And hopefully that's what we see going forward.","I think the main point is the industry is substantially more resilient, and that's a big accomplishment. It's a lot of work to get here for all of us. It may mean lower returns but it means a more resilient industry; and that's a positive place to be.","Mike Mayo","Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks. Ruth, you mentioned in your commentary on SIC about structure transactions being a contributor. I'm curious if that is only in commodities or if that was in other parts of the business and how big of a driver. And more importantly is that a sustainable appetite by clients, because we've all been waiting for that for a while.","Ruth Porat","I'm glad you asked that. It was a comment specific to commodities. In commodities, it was a combination of structured activity, the physical and trading activity. The majority of client facing flow in structured business, it was in the backdrop of what's gone on in the oil markets, it was good to see the volume of structured transactions. But as I said, I'm not going to do a forecast on.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. And does that mean \u2013 I don't want to put words in your mouth, but was the commodities contribution of the quarter larger than normal times just because of some of the things you mentioned plus the weather?","Ruth Porat","Well, commodities as you know well, is stronger in the first quarter. And so it was up some versus last quarter. But the bigger driver was the strength in macro with rates and foreign exchange up nicely year over year.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, cool. And then RWA down 4% for the firm sequentially, I think you said 6% in SIC. It's good; it's welcome. Is that not a number that we want to straightline, right?","Ruth Porat","I'm sorry, the number\u2026","Glenn Schorr","Can it fall at that pace on an annualized basis?","Ruth Porat","So, two parts to that question. At 6% sync [ph] I noted that it's down to $174 billion; and we're retaining the target at $180 billion. We're very focused on RWA efficiency, and we've indicated there's another $25 billion that runs off post 2015.","And we're going to be very clinical and flexible in the way we allocate that capital across the franchise in a way that optimizes returns. But to your question, would we want you to straight line from there, I think I've answered that.","Glenn Schorr","Cool. Last one, easy one, share count was flat year on year, but you got a higher authorization. That's just math, right? We can count on maybe 2% shrinkage this year in the share count?","Ruth Porat","Yes, the main thing is we got a higher authorization and that we start executing on the share repurchase as we come out of the second quarter. And we expect to execute that radically over the time period.","Glenn Schorr","Thanks for everything, Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Couple of quick ones here. Cap Markets, the equity strength. How much of that, I know you highlighted across regions, and you gave some great color, Ruth, on some of the various components.","How much of a tailwind was Europe this quarter, just given some of the strength and on the back of QE there?","Ruth Porat","Well as we've talked about on many quarters, we run the business with a nine box strategy product across the top cash derivatives in PB and then regions, Americas, EMEA and Asia. In the first quarter, every box was strong. The big theme, as I said, was increased investor interest outside of the US, and particularly US investors in the rest of the world.","We clearly saw a pick up in client engagement in the EU on the back of the CB actions, but we also saw cash share gains in Asia with a pickup in client activity on the Asia growth opportunity and relative value there. We had nice frets to the business.","The key question is the ongoing macro backdrop, as I said, and the nature of volatility. This quarter was characterized by LV trending volatility and a lot worked well. It was the best quarter in a long time. Looking forward, we'd anchor the outlook to what we've see over the last few years. But there were a lot of good things going on around the globe.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks for that color. And then thinking about Wealth Management here, can you give maybe a little color? It's early, but on any potential impact from the Department of Labor proposal?","Ruth Porat","So, respect to the DOL proposal, it's still in the comment period' there are a number of open items to address. Based on our best interpretation of the proposal at this point, we don't expect a meaningful impact on our business. We do expect some changes in activity, and we do expect more compliance-related costs.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. And then I know the loan growth environment is sort of tough. But sequential loan growth slowed somewhat, and it looked like PLA slowed more than mortgage. Was there anything driving that, and should we ratchet down expectations for loan growth? Or was that more sort of like a single quarter type of a slowdown there?","Ruth Porat","Yes. Loan growth is still very much on plan, consistent with what James went through on the fourth quarter. We talked a lot about prudent loan grow. There is some seasonality with PLA in mortgages in the first quarter.","But we have a healthy and diversified pipeline and expect it to continue to deliver steady prudent loan growth. The main point to talk about is two sizable franchises with diversified assets. We have ample opportunities for loan growth.","Brennan Hawken","Terrific. Last one from me. Any chance to quantify the legal charge in both overall firm and in the securities business?","Ruth Porat","No, we commented that non-comp expense was up a bit here due in part to legal; but we're not breaking it out.","Brennan Hawken","Okay.","James Gorman","The main takeaway on that is that the big legal stuff relating to the crisis we feel is behind us. We are dealing with some of the one-off smaller events as we move forward here.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for that, James. Congrats to you, Ruth. Best of luck on your switch over to the left coast there.","Ruth Porat","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Ruth, one more on equities. And not really focused on the quarter but if I look over the last four or six quarters, it seems like the traction of the progress has just been continuous. And it's been pretty consistent across products, across geographies.","I just want to get a sense, when you look at what's going on in the equity business and when you look at some of the pressures on the business and on the regulatory environment with clients, are you seeing more market share in areas where you guys are differentiating versus the customers or versus competitors?","And is there any nuance between the high touch, the low touch or anything else? It just seems like the consistency in the traction has been very consistent across the past two years.","Ruth Porat","So we are of the view, and I've talked about this on prior calls, of the view that we're benefiting from a lot of investments in the business over many years. So it's back to early technology investments in the business that enable us to execute on behalf of clients in all market environments and do so on a cost efficient basis, where we're driving returns for stakeholders as well.","It goes to the quality and content of the team, so that it very much is high tech, high touch and the breadth of the franchise. Talk about the nine box strategy because it's so core to way the team runs it, and with this maniacal focus within each box.","But then as we talked about over many years now, a focus on what are the adjacencies, so that has we go deeper with clients in certain areas they go deeper with us. It is a very tightly run business, but its delivering results.","James Gorman","I'd just add to that, Mike, that remember coming out of the financial crisis our prime brokerage business clearly took a hit. And that is being rebuilt. I think over time, essentially gained share. The strength of that business has been a real additive.","And secondly, these businesses do well in a large part because of the quality of the leadership team running them. And we've had a very stable and strong, deep leadership team running now [ph] these business for several years, and I think that makes a difference.","Michael Carrier","Okay. That's helpful. You have set out the ROE target, and you hit around that area this quarter. And, James, it sounds like when you talked about dialing up the risk, it wasn't one of those quarters where everything worked. There was obviously good progress, but it could've been better.","I just want to get a sense of when you guys look at some of the things that can improve in terms of the Wealth Management pretax margin, things that you have control of, it still seems a little surprising when I think about a 10% ROE and then I look at your business. 20% is fixed income, and then 80% is equities, banking and wealth management and investment management. Things that we generally think of a higher ROE.","When I think about going over the next couple quarters, years, besides the things that you have control of, are there other things on the capital side or the balance sheet side that will continue to boost that ROE?","I know the ROTE is higher; it's around 12% versus the 10%. I just wanted to get your sense on what will be the drivers to improve that, besides the margin in the wealth management business.","James Gorman","Well, let me take a cut at that, and I'm sure Ruth will add on. Firstly, I think a lot of folks really haven't given much attention to the E part of this equation. When we started as a team five years ago, our E was around $40 billion; it's now around $68 billion, I think. So if we were still operating with the same equity we had five years ago, our ROE would actually be in the order of magnitude of 15%, our ROET well above that.","So we've been through a major repositioning of this firm in the regulatory environment. The key has been to put ourselves in a position where we had enough capital, where we wouldn't be going, needing to go out and raise capital, accrete excess capital and so on. And ultimately, the test of that would be successful CCAR capital distributions.","We've now had three years where we've lifted our dividend from $0.20 to $0.40, now $0.60 a year. Lifted our buyback from 500 to 1 billion to now 2.5 billion, and we expect to increase capital actions in the years ahead. The E part of this equation, I think, deserves a little bit of attention.","On the R side, two things are going on. One, we have a very, very focused non-comp expense program we've had in process for a few years, which has a huge team here, led by Charlie Chasen here. They are very focused on that. We're not going to let go or let hold of the non-comp side.","And on the comps side, it's pretty clear. We said the ISG comp to revenue ratio would be below 40%, and indeed it was. And we're bringing down the comp to revenue ratio for the other businesses as we build scale.","Then you look at where the opportunities are, and they are many, frankly. We're not yet in a global economy which is by any means robust. The Wealth Management full transition to the managed product hasn't yet occurred. The bank loan products, we've still got tremendous capacity there. We haven't seen the interest rate hike, which we're going to get at some point in the future.","The M&A and ECM businesses clearly will pick up as the global economies pickup, and I could go on with a long list. I'm giving a long answer because it's a complicated, multifaceted thing.","But I would look at all of those, starting with the move to non-comp, the comp to revenue commitments, capital plans and then follow with the particular revenue drivers in each of the businesses that exist today and are likely to exist in the changing, high rate environment going forward.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Makes sense. Thanks a lot.","James Gorman","Sure.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.","Christian Bolu","Good morning, James. Good morning, Ruth.","James Gorman","Morning.","Christian Bolu","James, on the regulatory environment, the SEC seems to be focused on the potential abuse of fee-based accounts, so-called reverse churning. Given Morgan Stanley's fee-based accounts have more than doubled since 2009, I'd be curious as to what kind of controls or checks you have in place to ensure the proper use of fee-based accounts at Morgan Stanley","James Gorman","Well, this is one of those questions which, depending on the environment, you could ask it one way or the other. A lot of people spend their time complaining about the churning on transaction type accounts, which is why the fee-based industry has really evolved. Where clients, certain clients, have wanted the certainty of knowing they pay one fee, and with that they either do none or as much transaction activity as they want to do. So it seems to me it would be a very natural market segmentation.","There will be some clients for example, people with large restricted stock positions, which that would probably not be something they want to do. But from many others who want a more advice driven relationship, it obviously is. Whether its transaction activity or fee-based activity, we have an enormous compliance operation in our wealth management division, driven down to the branch level.","Both at the personal touch level and also at the model-driven level, where we look for exceptions, which looks at suitability, concentration risk and all the other things that you would expect to make sure that the clients are properly served at the pricing that they're getting.","Christian Bolu","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. A question on the tax strategy. I think tax benefit seems to be recurrent theme quarter after quarter. At a very high level, could you explain the firm's tax strategy and how we should conceptually think about any tax benefits going forward.","Ruth Porat","Well, this quarter was the result of a legal entity simplification consistent with resolution. We would still guide you to around 30% as the effective tax rate on a go-forward basis.","Christian Bolu","Okay, there's no wide tax strategy or anything in that nature we should think about?","Ruth Porat","No. As I said, this was legal entity simplification; and I guide you at 30%.","Christian Bolu","Okay. A couple of cleanup questions. On the M&A backlog, I believe you said it was up year over year. How does a look on a link quarter basis?","Ruth Porat","It is up year-over-year and that is the way we've been looking at it.","Christian Bolu","Okay. And then on the funding cost benefits, how should we think about the allocation between FIC and equities?","Ruth Porat","So, as we've talked about a number of calls, we allocate funding, balance sheet, liquidity based down to the product level. And it's really based on the asset mix, and so that's the real driver of it.","We haven't broken that out, but it's going to benefit across sales and trading. And it's a nice tailwind that is increasingly building through 2016 year.","Christian Bolu","Okay. Thank you. And just lastly, like the sentiments of my peers, it's been a pleasure working with you, Ruth. You're definitely going to be missed.","Ruth Porat","Thank you very much.","Christian Bolu","Thank you.","James Gorman","I feel like all of you are going to start selling tick stocks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.","Steven Chubak","Certainly pleased to see the ISG comp leverage really show through in the quarter in light of the revenue strength. I was just wondering how we should think about the comp leverage versus the full-year target of 39%, assuming you can actually deliver revenue growth for the full year?","Ruth Porat","So when we set the comp ratio, it's with a full-year outlook. So the 38% is the full-year outlook. Again, that's all things equal. That's the way it's set.","We remain very committed to rewarding those who drive returns. And we think with the steps we've taken on comp structure and the operating leverage in the business, this is a full-year outlook -- again, all things equal.","Steven Chubak","Okay. And then maybe switching over to the capital side for a moment. We're certainly pleased to see the significant build in the leverage ratio in the quarter. When parsing the individual components of that ratio, it looks like the improvement was really driven by a reduction in SLR add-ons more so than anything else.","And I was just wondering if you could speak to what the current level is of those SLR add-ons, and maybe how we should be thinking about sources of future mitigation potential.","Ruth Porat","Well from the benefit this quarter was really both numerator and denominator. You're absolutely right; in the denominator, we have work streams against all the various gross ups, and we had reductions in net long CDS sold.","And we're benefiting from compression activity, which I would say industry wide has become more business as usual, which we think is a real positive.","We were early on that, and it's good to see it has been broadly embraced. The numerator clearly benefited from earnings in our preferred issuance early in the quarter. So we remain focused on all of the items that are possible and logical for mitigation.","Compression, as I said, but across the board, remain focused on ensuring that if we're using balance sheet, where we're using balance sheet. It continues to provide the kind of returns commensurate with the capital that's being required here. And so it's, again, a deep focus; but it's both a numerator and a denominator benefit.","Steven Chubak","Okay. Thanks, Ruth. And then just lastly on the Wealth Management side and specifically the new long-term deposit target of $200 billion, which Greg spoke to at a recent investor conference. In the past you've highlighted some metrics where maybe your under penetrated relative to peers to help drive future growth.","And was hoping, in the context of this specific target, whether you could highlight any specific metrics which would support that additional growth towards that $200 billion.","Ruth Porat","Well, we've talked about, I say it so often, I'm sure you're tired of hearing it, but we're focused on prudent loan growth across both wealth management and institutional securities. We do believe we have meaningful upside from here, given the scale of the client base and the relative penetration, in particular in wealth management. We've talked about that. The $200 billion deposit target is really married to our expected loan demand over the next several years.","And so the execution plan on deposit growth, as we looked at what is the loan potential given these two large franchises, the expectation for deposit growth was two phases. The contractual on boarding from city, and as I think you know, that ends this quarter, the second quarter of 2015, but we are in an excess deposit position.","Our loan to deposit ratio is at 51%. And even if we load in standby liquidity to support loans, the ratio is at 74%. So we do have a nice runway before we need additional deposits to support loan growth.","And then as we've talked about on the fourth-quarter call and as Greg commented on, we have substantial organic deposit growth opportunity given our client base. We still have a large portion of cash held away.","But it's really calculated with a lens to what is the loan growth opportunity across Wealth Management and institutional securities. And we see quite of bit of opportunity from here against which we will execute over time, prudently, leading with credit risk management.","Steven Chubak","Okay. Thanks, Ruth. That's really helpful. And congrats on the new role and best of luck at future opportunity.","Ruth Porat","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Ruth Porat","Good morning.","Matthew O'Connor","You had mentioned earlier about long-term debt cost coming down and I think implied you're still early on in that process. Maybe if you could just size how much benefit you've had so far from that and try and shape how much opportunity is still in front of us.","Ruth Porat","Well, as we indicated from peak financing costs to end of 2016, it's down about 25%. And the benefit comes in as we refinance debt that was issued post crisis, given our credit spreads are meaningfully tighter. And so as we see more of that we refinance, the greater the benefits. That's why it lags in over time.","Matthew O'Connor","And do you have what the blended rate of your long-term debt is, the $155 billion?","Ruth Porat","I don't have that with me.","Matthew O'Connor","Okay.","Ruth Porat","It's in the filings, I don't have it with me.","Matthew O'Connor","Okay. But just I mean, conceptually, are we halfway through - your spreads have been coming in quite a bit, market rates have been coming down, even just the past year here so. I think there's still additional opportunity to bring those rates down.","Ruth Porat","There is a decent opportunity. Some of the debt that we refinanced was put on pre-crisis, and so we've only recently begun to tap into that portion of it that was put on post crisis. At a certain point, it was actually more of a headwind.","It's been turning recently to become a tailwind, and that's why we called it out when we did. We delayed to call it out and at the point at which we were starting, not to refinance the early 2000 debt, but what was put on post crisis. That's why it's a delayed benefit here. Delayed posts are the contraction we've seen in our credit spreads.","Matthew O'Connor","Okay. That makes sense. All right, thank you.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell","Hey, good morning. Just maybe a follow-up on the capital question. You are substantially above on your common equity tier 1 ratio; but on the SLR, you're just slightly above the minimum. How do you think about the interplay of the leverage versus the common equity, to a point where you can start to return even more of the common equity to maximize returns?","Is there a lot more to go on the denominator in the leverage ratio, or does it mean potentially more preferred to maximize shareholder returns? How do you think about that dynamic over time, and what kind of a cushion do you think you need on the SLR?","Ruth Porat","So, I've already answered part of it in response to an earlier question which is, we've talked frequently about the way to maximize return and capital over the longer term is to have steady increases. No discontinuous moves in the request for return of capital.","And we're very pleased to have the ability this year, at the $3.1 billion share repurchase over the five quarter period and the dividends up 50%. So when we look at the requirement, there are clearly a number of them. Interest rate capital, it's SLR, it's the CCAR process itself, it's how you think about the stress losses.","SLR obviously was not in CCAR in the last round. But we have a forward-looking lens as we think about the business, where we consider all of those factors. And as we looked to optimize the opportunity across the franchise, both from a returns perspective and the ability to return capital, we look through each one of those lenses.","At this point though, as I said, SLR hasn't been included in the CCAR that would govern how much we can return. But that obviously hasn't stopped us implementing strong work streams to mitigate the gross up in the denominator, as we've already talked about on this call.","We look at all. You have to look at all; you can't just tip to one versus the other. Again, it's with a lens that we want to ensure we're providing balance sheet capital behind client activity and doing it in the most constructive way. But it's complicated. There's no question with the multiplicity of requirements. But that's what we've been managing against.","James Mitchell","So hear but on the CCAR, your constraining factors were more of the tier 1 ratio's, right, the leverage the total capital? So I'm just trying to get a sense. Do you think there's a lot more to do on the denominator side or do you think it would make more sense to issue more preferred to deal with that? Or do you think you have enough time to make more efficiencies on the balance sheet side? That's what I'm just trying to get at","Ruth Porat","Okay, sorry. On that, part of it is the CCAR process itself. We were pleased this year that on one input to the overall calculation, PP&R, the estimate by the Federal Reserve increased. We believe that reflects the greater consistency we have in earnings. We put a lot of effort behind trying to clarify that, and we're pleased that it picked up.","And when you look at what were some of the things that took the total capital calculation lower, the leverage lower, there was a difference between estimates firm and Federal Reserve on balance sheet growth or RWAs over the period. And our view is that the test is a learning process, even though there's not that much transparency in it and that it's really about addressing some of those elements of it.","So that's one component, trying to narrow the gap between the Federal Reserve's estimate and the firm's estimate on things like balance sheet growth. You know, is the fair value firm and we don't see that kind of balance sheet growth.","And then on the second part of it, of course ensuring we are being very clinical and direct on balance sheet use in other elements of it. We look at all preferred and sub debt as ways to optimize capital over time, and we'll continue to do so. We've been doing that for the last couple of years.","James Gorman","Just think about where we've come from. The SLR, we're at about 4.2%; a year ago, we were at 5.1%. With some of the actions we took, we intentionally depleted our capital in the last several months, including the charge relating to the Attorney General action, Department of Justice, and the charge related to our deferrals.","The good news is we're above 5% now. We have several years to stave up 5%. We have several years to work the balance sheet and, as necessary, use preferred securities. So we have a long runway to keep this in motion, and we're pretty confident we can stay above 5% and do the things that Ruth talked about.","James Mitchell","Absolutely. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","Just a couple quick follow ups here. So on the bank and strong loan demand, is it reasonable to think that you could skew more towards loans than you presented? I think you've given roughly 60% loans as a percent of assets by 2016 end. Is that the optimal mix; or, if the demand is there, could we see that mix look more lending heavy?","Ruth Porat","Just 13 weeks ago, James refreshed our outlook on the six-point plan and provided we added another year on the bank outlook to give you a sense of the asset mix. And the real point of doing that was so that you could model, when you expect a rate increase. We're giving you our outlook on asset mix, and there's no updates there on what was reviewed last quarter.","Devin Ryan","Okay. All right, great. And then just coming back to the strength in EMEA in the quarter. It sounds like that was more trading heavy in the trading businesses. Were there any specific areas that really experienced improvement? Does that tone of activity still feel good, and do you see that spilling into other businesses?","Ruth Porat","I've indicated it was in both equities and in fixed income in macro products. But as I noted, it was not just Europe. We saw a focus on the opportunity in Asia as well. It's an early start to the quarter here. As we typically say at this point, a couple of weeks is not a quarter.","Devin Ryan","Okay. Thanks very much.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Ruth, I wanted to focus one more question on the debt opportunity and specifically on the legacy trust to preferreds that you have outstanding.","I think your plan previously was to potentially redeem most, if not all, of those this year. I'm wondering what the timing is on that based on your CCAR results this past go around?","Ruth Porat","We did include the redemption of trust in CCAR because it's expensive relative to where it stands today. The rules are complicated, but we do remain focused on eliminating the drag. That was the piece we withdrew. We did not change our requested return of capital. The $3.1 billion share repurchase and the dividend increase of 50% weren't altered. And we're pleased to attest qualitatively.","Matt Burnell","Okay. And then just in terms of investment banking trends, obviously very strong quarter across the franchise in trading. To James's earlier point, you're not hitting on all cylinders, and banking within ISG was a little bit less strong.","Can you give us some color as to your outlook as to the potential opportunities or strengths within EMEA and Asia, specifically within the banking business?","James Gorman","I think firstly, just looking at the banking franchise, it's a terrific franchise. We actually had a strong quarter; some others had very strong quarters, all power to them. We have a good pipeline. Obviously, it's a lumpier business in any 13-week period than some of the other businesses, so you're going to expect a little more bouncing around. No concerns there.","We are seeing a pickup in Europe. Asia has been slow. Japan was a little slow earlier in the year, but we're starting to see some cross-border activity there. Well-positioned strong franchises in Japan and China. So I think the outlook remains very firm.","Matt Burnell","Okay. Thanks very much.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","James Gorman","I think that brings this call to an end. I just wanted to take a moment to thank our dear friend Ruth, wish her well. I'm also sorry to see the analysts are now moving to the West Coast, following her. We'll have to pick up some others over here.","But on a more serious note, she's been a great partner. Has sat in the office next to me for five years, and done a terrific job in helping get this firm back from the depths of the financial crisis. And it takes a great team. Ruth had a great team working with her. She followed also a terrific CFO, who helped us navigate the crisis during extraordinarily stressful period, Tom Kelleher. And she now precedes another new CFO, as I said John Pruzan, who I think will also be terrific.","And throughout it all, we've had a deputy CFO that many of you have not heard on these calls, but has been in many of the meetings. Paul Wirth has been an extraordinary able and steady hand now through the last three CFOs we've had at this firm, so great team. Thank you Ruth. We wish you well. And don't forget us.","We're going to leave Ruth with something to remind her of Morgan Stanley, not that she would ever forget us. But we wish her the best. Thanks, everybody, for a good call.","Ruth Porat","Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation."],"14795":["Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Q3 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call October 19, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Kathleen McCabe - Head, IR","James Gorman - Chairman and CEO","Jonathan Pruzan - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Michael Carrier - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Fiona Swaffield - RBC","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Operator","Kathleen McCabe","Good morning.

This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James Gorman","Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, and apologies for my winter cold. I wanted to start off just by saying, obviously after a relatively strong first half the third quarter was obviously disappointing. It reflected a difficult market environment throughout the quarter.","Before we discuss some of the things that are behind these numbers and that drove this result, let me touch on a few of the positive aspects of the last three months.","Our M&A franchise remained strong this quarter, benefiting from a robust deal environment. While much of the underwriting calendar was deferred from the third quarter, we expect the business to take place in the fourth quarter and early 2016.","Equities once again finished number one in the US this quarter, and we expect to be number one once all global peers have reported over the coming weeks. After a strong first half, the business held together in a challenging environment across regions and products, including cash, derivatives and prime brokerage. We expect this trend to continue.","Our wealth management franchise was impacted by a lack of new issue product and a general retail investor step back from markets, given volatility. While we do not expect this to be a long-term trend, we remain focused on expenses in the meantime.","Our year-over-year earnings improved, in spite of lower revenues and we generated a 23% margin, which is consistent with our stated goals.","Turning now to the challenges, of which there are three to note, and of which Jon will take you through in more detail in a moment. First, and obviously fixed income underperformed in the quarter, largely due to a very challenging market environment, in which we were significantly impacted given our business mix, particularly our focus on credit and rates.","Second, most of the investment management business performed solidly, but the aggregate results significantly underperformed. This was driven largely by a reversal of carry in our Asia private equity business, a business which historically has been a strong contributor for over a decade.","And third, we also had $320 million in legal expenses in the quarter, an increase of $250 million from last year, driven largely by the settlement of the CDS litigation.","We remain focused on resolving outstanding legal issues and have made significant progress to date. Notwithstanding the challenges of the quarter, our core long-term strategy remains in place, namely, a balanced business model in which the consistency of wealth management offsets potential volatility in institutional securities.","The team is highly focused on those levers within our control that enable us to manage the business in a way that reflects the environment we are in, and whatever the environment we may face in the future. This includes a continued focus on expenses.","We recently made significant management changes in two businesses to better leverage our business model. Ted Pick, who has managed equities to the number one position on the Street has become Global Head of Sales and Trading.","Having institutional equities, fixed incomes and research under Ted will allow us to leverage our infrastructure while continuing to make sensible investments in the ongoing electronification of both our equities and fixed income franchises.","Dan Simkowitz has become Head of Investment Management, which includes Merchant Banking, real estate investing, and traditional asset management. Dan will report to me and work to broaden our platform and products, while leveraging distribution channels that we have in place. Investment management is an important business for Morgan Stanley for the future and deserves our intense focus. Finally, our capital funding and liquidity positions remain robust.","With that, Jon will take you through the quarter in more detail, then we will open up for questions to both of us. Thank you very much.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone. I will review our quarterly financial performance and business results, and then James and I will be happy to take your questions.","Before I discuss the individual businesses, I will first make a few comments on our overall performance. The quarter was very challenging. In contrast to the first half, the third quarter backdrop was less constructive.","Besides the normal summer seasonality, the quarter was characterized by global equity markets trending lower, volatility metrics increasing, spreads widening, policy uncertainty and periodic bouts of risk aversion.","Against this backdrop, revenues were $7.8 billion in the third quarter or $7.3 billion excluding DVA, down 20% versus second quarter '15, or 23% excluding DVA. Our expenses for the quarter were $6.3 billion, down 10% versus $7 billion in 2Q '15. Compensation expense was $3.4 billion, down 22% versus $4.4 billion last quarter, driven by lower revenues.","Non-compensation expenses were $2.9 billion, up 9% versus $2.6 billion in 2Q '15, driven by an increase in litigation reserves, which included an increase related to the settlement of the credit default swap antitrust litigation matter.","Our effective tax rate of approximately 29% was lower than last quarter, driven by our geographic mix of earnings. ROE for the third quarter was 5.6% or 3.9% ex-DVA.","Now to the businesses. Our institutional securities franchise had a difficult third quarter, with revenues of $3.9 billion or $3.5 billion excluding DVA, down 25% and 30% respectively versus second quarter of 2015.","We saw underperformance in fixed income, driven by relative mix of our business, primarily by lower revenue in credit and securitized products in a challenging credit market, in addition to lower activity and rates given investor uncertainty on said action.","More broadly in our sales and trading and capital market businesses, we were impacted by seasonality and lower than typical levels of activity in September. However, we continued to demonstrate strength in several key franchises.","Equity sales and trading revenues were strong, as clients remained engaged across regions and products, and in advisory, we had our best quarter in several years, as M&A volumes remain strong.","Non-interest expense was down 9% versus the second quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $1.9 billion for the quarter, up 15%, driven primarily by increased litigation reserve, I mentioned previously.","Compensation expenses were $1.3 billion, down 31% quarter-over-quarter. Excluding DVA, the ISG compensation ratio was held flat at the first half rate of 38%.","In investment banking, we saw strong performance in our M&A business offset by weakness in the debt and equity underwriting markets, resulting in investment banking revenues of $1.2 billion, down 18% sequentially.","As of September 30, Morgan Stanley ranked number one in global IPOs, number two in global announced M&A and number three in global equity. In advisory, we benefited from a continuation of a robust M&A market.","We saw strength in cross border M&A and large cap transactions and acted as M&A advisor on several of the quarter's most significant transactions. We acted as sole financial advisor to Cigna on their merger with Anthem in the transaction valued at $54 billion in cash and stock. The combined company will be the leading health insurer in the US.","Morgan Stanley also acted as sole financial advisor to ACE on their acquisition of Chubb for $28 billion in cash and stock. Advisory revenues for the quarter were $557 million, 32% higher than the second quarter.","The M&A pipeline remains strong, up both year-over-year and sequentially. We have seen a strong start to deal activity in the fourth quarter, and board room engagement and dialogue remains high.","Turning to underwriting. Our underwriting business slowed significantly, as the typical pick up in September deal activity was delayed due to uncertain markets. We had a significant number of deals delayed in September.","For the market, equity underwriting volume was down 55%, IPO underwriting volume was down 72%, and debt underwriting volume was down 23% versus last quarter.","Underwriting revenues were $624 million this quarter, down 39% versus last quarter. Equity underwriting revenues were $250 million, down 49% versus second quarter, primarily reflecting declines across all products, particularly for IPOs and follow-ons.","Fixed income underwriting revenues were down 29% versus the second quarter driven by decreases in both investment grade and non-investment grade loan and bond underwriting.","Notable underwriting transactions in the quarter includes in equity, Morgan Stanley acted as joint underwriter and joint lead manager on a $3.6 billion rights offering for Commonwealth Bank of Australia. We also acted as a joint global coordinator, lead left book writer and stabilization agent for Citizens Financial Group in their $2.6 billion follow-on offering.","In capital markets, we see a strong pipeline building for future quarters, as clients await a more stable market. As volatility abates, we would expect to see a pickup in activity.","In the first 12 days of the quarter, we have begun to see many of the delayed deals from September's price. However, the sustainability of this activity will be predicated on the market backdrop.","Coming off of two strong quarters, equity sales and trading again was solid, against a backdrop of significantly more volatility. The business remained number one in the US, and we believe we continue to be number one globally, driven by our focus on clients and execution, which has led us to our leadership position.","Ex-DVA, revenues of $1.8 billion in the quarter were down 22% sequentially, but essentially flat year-over-year, as clients remained active and engaged.","Cash equity revenues were down versus the second quarter and year-over-year, driven by a more challenging environment, including a lighter primary calendar and periods of risk aversion.","Prime brokerage revenues remained solid, although down from a very strong second quarter, which is seasonally high related to European dividend activities. Revenues were up year-over-year due to increased client engagement.","Derivative revenues were down quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower corporate derivative activity, but remained strong and were up year-over-year. Year-to-date, we have delivered strong performance in equities, with revenues, excluding DVA, up 19% year over year. Despite very different market backdrops, we have been able to serve our clients' needs while prudently managing risk.","In fixed income and commodities, we saw a very challenging market environment. We were particularly impacted by spread widening in credit and mortgages and lower levels of client activity and rates throughout the quarter.","For the quarter, fixed income and commodity sales and trading revenue were $583 million, excluding DVA, down 54% versus the second quarter.","Revenues and credit and securitized products were hardest hit and were down significantly quarter-over-quarter due to difficult market conditions.","Rates revenues in the quarter were down sequentially, driven by significant policy uncertainty, that led to sporadic client activity and engagement.","FX results were up modestly versus second quarter as increased volatility led to continued client engagement. Over time, FX has been a much smaller relative business for us.","Commodities results were up modestly quarter-over-quarter, and our risk-weighted assets, X lending, ended the quarter at $158 billion, essentially flat to second quarter.","The fourth quarter end sales and trading is typically seasonally weakest. So far in the quarter some of the key drivers that will likely drive client activity are mixed. Drivers of near-term uncertainty, including the Fed, China, commodities and global growth, have not diminished.","However, we have seen a modest rebound in global markets and reduction in some volatility indices, including the VIX.","Investment revenues were up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, driven by gains on business-related investments. Other revenues were down versus last quarter, driven primarily by markdowns on our relationship and event books. Lastly, average trading VAR for the second quarter was $53 million, stable versus last quarter. Although we saw increases in volatility, it was offset by a reduction in risk.","Turning to wealth management, our wealth management business provided stability in the quarter, even in a turbulent and declining global market. While revenues were down 6% for the quarter, largely driven by lower marks in our deferred compensation plans, we maintained a 23% margin. Our bank strategy continued to play out, as we had previously discussed.","Over the past few years, our daily revenues are a good indication of the stability and consistency of our wealth management business and they have consistently been between $50 million and $70 million, with no day year-to-date below this range.","Asset management revenues were flat from last quarter with higher revenues from fee-based accounts, partially offset by lower mutual fund activity.","Global fee-based asset inflows were $7.7 billion in the quarter, continuing the trend we see toward client demand for managed accounts. Total fee-based client assets were $770 billion at quarter end, representing 40% of client assets. The assets are down quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the market decline of the third quarter.","We saw continued softness in transactional revenues, which were down 25% compared to the last quarter. This was primarily driven by lower marks in our deferred compensation plans, as well as lower new issue activity, consistent with a slower equity underwriting calendar, which impacted ISG.","Transactional revenues were also impacted by subdued levels of retail investor activity, driven by ongoing uncertainty and global volatility.","Our deposit deployment strategy continues to yield results. Net interest income revenue increased 2% quarter-over-quarter, driven by steady, prudent growth in lending, consistent with the continued execution of our US bank strategy.","Funded lending balances in wealth management grew approximately $3 billion during the quarter and $12 billion year-over-year. In the mortgage business, average FICO scores continue to be greater than 750, with weighted average LTVs of less than 65%. And securities-based lending remains highly over collateralized and continued to perform well despite the quarter's volatility.","Non-interest expenses were $2.8 billion, down 6% quarter-over-quarter, showing continued expense discipline in this business. Compensation expenses was $2 billion, down 8% quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower marks on deferred compensation plans, and lower FA compensation, as a result of lower compensable revenues. Non-compensation expense was flat sequentially.","Deposits in our bank deposit program were $139 billion, up $7 billion versus the second quarter, as clients moved into cash and a volatile market. This is another indicator of subdued retail activity. But we would expect clients to redeploy this cash over time.","Wealth management representatives were up slightly versus the second quarter on lower attrition. This business not only provides stability and consistency, but also growth. PBT for the first nine months of 2015 is up 14% over the same period in 2014.","In investment management, the quarter was difficult, for Asia valuations in particular in China and monetization events, which resulted in revenues of $274 million, down 64% sequentially.","The vast majority of the sequential declines in revenue could be attributed to the reversal of previously-accrued carried interest in our Asia private equity business and no material gains in our other funds versus last quarter.","We have a strong history in Asia private equity and in particular, China. This quarter however, we had to reverse more than two-thirds of the carry that our Asia private equity funds had accrued.","This reversal accounted for virtually all of the loss reported on the investments line in the investment management segment. The ultimate realization of carry in these funds will be based on investment performance over the next several years.","In traditional asset management, revenues for the quarter were $389 million, down 10% quarter-over-quarter. The focus in this business continues to be on product innovation, distribution and growth.","For example, this quarter, we transferred certain portfolio managers and their portfolios from wealth management to investment management to better align our capabilities with client demand.","This move allows the portfolio management teams to distribute their strategies in multiple vehicles across a broader and fully integrated distribution channel, while also enhancing the product mix available to our investment management clients.","Non-interest expenses were $312 million, down 41%, driven primarily by a reduction in compensation expense versus last quarter, due to a decrease in deferred compensation associated with carried interest. Total assets under management ended the quarter at approximately $404 billion.","Turning to the balance sheet and capital, total assets were $834 billion at September 30, up from $826 billion at the end of the second quarter. However, average balance sheet for the quarter was $828 billion, down from $848 billion in the second quarter.","Our global liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $191 billion compared with $188 billion at the end of the second quarter.","Now onto capital, reflecting our best estimate of the final Federal Reserve rules, our pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratio base, using the Basel III fully phased-in advanced approach was 12.4% at September 30.","Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $434 billion, up from $427 billion in the second quarter. We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the US final rule to be approximately 5.5% at September 30, up from 5.3% at the end of the second quarter. All of these estimates are preliminary, and subject to revisions.","During the third quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock, or approximately 17 million shares, and our Board declared a $0.15 dividend per share.","With that, we will open up the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Guy Moszkowski","Good morning. First a question on equities. It is, as you pointed out, flat year-over-year, and industry leading. But your peers were all up mostly double-digits or very high single digits year-over-year.","I guess the question is, we know that some of the strength year-to-date, especially for firms with a strong prime brokerage franchise, has been from repricing of some of the more scarce resources down feed driven activities.","I guess the question is, for you, has some of that pricing benefit lapsed or anniversaried, or are what we actually seeing is that underlying all of that, maybe you had more significant weakness in cash equities, like because of blocks or something?","Jonathan Pruzan","So Guy, I guess there were a couple different questions in there. I think in terms of our equities performance, as we said, we continued to maintain our leadership position and we are number one. Quarter-over-quarter all of the products were down. We obviously had a very strong first half.","PB was down due to some lack of the dividend seasonality that we see third quarter versus second quarter, but as you said, up year-over-year, derivatives were lower quarter over quarter, on less corporate derivative activity, but was up year-over-year.","So the weakness year-over-year was really in the cash products, where we saw, obviously, a much more challenging market environment, sporadic bouts of risk aversion, as well as slower \u2013 excuse me, primary calendar.","The other point I would make is that the third quarter of '14 for us in equities was a very strong quarter, driven really by a very strong primary calendar. So it was a tough comp from that perspective, but again, essentially flat year-over-year.","And then lastly, I think on the repricing question, I would answer by saying that we've been focused on the returns to the prime brokerage business, and we've done that in partnership with our clients and looking at the relationship holistically across the nine boxes that we've discussed before.","We've done this through a combination of better business mix, optimization and wider pricing, and we've seen the revenue per balance sheet usage increase over the last year. So the prime brokerage business has been and will continue to be a strong business for us, and it's been really a business that the client engagement has led to good results.","Guy Moszkowski","I guess just to hone in on that last part a little bit, were a lot of the pricing changes that you were able to put through in the third quarter a year ago and therefore are we beginning to see kind of an anniversary effect of the benefit that you get from that pricing?","Jonathan Pruzan","I wouldn't necessarily describe it like that. We've been continually trying to optimize the return we get on our assets. And I would say it's been an evolutionary process, and we will continue to work with our clients to deliver good products and a good relationship.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. Thanks. And then moving on to asset management, the decline in the additional [ph] revenues away from the merchant banking and real estate issues that we were talking about, the decline in revenue there is about I think 17% year-over-year, and yet your assets under management our flat. Do we attribute that decline to a lack of performance fees relative to a year ago?","Jonathan Pruzan","I'm sorry, in the traditional asset management business?","Guy Moszkowski","If you look at the traditional line that you break out, the revenue in the third quarter is down 17% year-over-year. but the assets under management look like they are unchanged.","And so I'm just wondering, what's driving that decline in the revenue. Is it performance fees that were not present in the current quarter or is there something else?","Jonathan Pruzan","No, I mean, I think it's more driven by mix. As you know, in that business we have a narrow product set in our equity businesses. We also are only in active products, so - and we've seen, as you can see from that chart, an increase in our liquidity product, where we've also seen decreases in certain of our equity products. As you see from the disclosure, we have an emerging market fund that saw significant outflows this quarter.","The other point that I would make is that it's related somewhat to the markdowns on the deferred compensation plans that we've talked about in the past, and that was also a driver to that decline.","Guy Moszkowski","Got it. And just a broad question on fixed. Given the results that you saw in the quarter, and I'm conscious of the mix difference that you talk about between yourselves and many of your peers.","But does the sharp decline and the magnitude of the revenue at this point spark any incremental thinking as to size and structure that's appropriate for the unit or the risk management that's appropriate for the unit?","Jonathan Pruzan","Listen, as we discussed in both James' and my comments, this was a very different market that we saw in the first quarter. I think the volatility, the lack of conviction, the policy uncertainty, coupled with really no macro themes or events that investors embrace.","So it was a very difficult market. It was not particularly conducive for our relative business mix, as you mentioned. But keep in mind that we've reshaped and resized this business based on the market opportunity that we think exists.","We brought down our RWAs in this business by over $200 billion. We've brought down our balance sheet. We've brought down our non-comp expenses. We've brought down our headcount. We've sold several commodities businesses and we closed another one and we've also revamped our distribution strategy.","We've resized this business, while maintaining a presence across products and geographies. And we continue to optimize this business in the face of challenges, both for the industry and the business.","We've seen cyclical, secular, structural, and regulatory changes in this business and many of these have led to announcements, particularly out of Europe, of people rethinking their overall strategies, and we do think that this market dislocation can create opportunity for us.","But we're focused on what we can control to drive improved performance. We've done a lot of work in this business, and we will continue to try to drive performance.","James Gorman","I'll just add a couple of things to what Jon said, Guy. Firstly, if you look at the performance of fixed this year, you've seen three very different quarters. First quarter being $4 billion revenues, second quarter being $1 billion, obviously this quarter a little under $600 million, very different macro environments, very different performance. This one, the least favorable environment to the particular business, we have obviously.","As Jon said, this has been a multi-year journey. We have dramatically reduced RWAs in this business and restructured it. I think combining the fixed income business with equities under the leadership of Mr. Pick here will prevent opportunities for further synergies with those businesses, which I would expect. And we continue to watch this space very carefully.","We're by no means complacent about this, and but at the same time, there are elements of our fixed income business which are essential to everything else that we do in investment banking with our wealth management and so on.","So it's a continuing focus of us, but I'm not taking everything from one single quarter. On the other hand, we want to make sure that if this isn't a long-term trend, than clearly we'll take whatever steps we need to take.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. That's all very helpful. Thank you so much.","James Gorman","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks. Just one follow-up on the FICC conversation. Because I agree with you Jon, that all the stuff that you've done have been an improvement in terms of reshaping and resizing.","But the results are the results, and I don't want to focus on any one given quarter. Let's look year-to-date, let's look at the last five years, it doesn't matter.","FICC is still having a hard time becoming, I guess, a fully functioning business, such that, in any given quarter if credit is bad, you're overweight credit.","So I guess, back to the same question, you moved it under Ted's supervision for a reason. What are you hoping that he can bring. Because he obviously did a great job in equities, but what are the things that transfer, what are the synergies that can come out of there, because I'm assuming the moves happened for a reason?","James Gorman","Well, Glenn, let me deal with that. Firstly, I think let's give Ted a little time in the saddle here, to come back to you, and I'm not going to speak for him right now. We'll give him a little time to get his arms around the business with the management team there, which they will do, and I'm sure in the New Year, we'll be saying a lot more about it.","But you have to see our fixed income business in the context of everything else we have at Morgan Stanley. It is obviously a significantly smaller business for us than equities or wealth management.","And frankly, has been smaller than investment banking over the last couple of years. So that's sort of the size of it, relative to what we are doing as an institution is an important factor here.","The idiosyncratic aspect of credit for this quarter is obviously important. Clearly, if foreign exchange was a weak quarter, then that would affect the Universal Banks differently from the way it would affect us. So I'm not going to get too caught up in one quarter's performance.","We understand the issues with fixed income. We are not alone in understanding those. I don't think there is a day that you don't read in the newspaper about one of the large banks thinking through the new fixed income market.","What it means in this very low rate environment, and what the outlook is and given the regulatory changes, how much balance sheet and what sort of risk weighted assets you can hold in the business.","As Jon said, we've made frankly very aggressive moves over three years, bringing the RWAs down from $390 billion-plus to $150 billion-plus today. We think bringing it together with equities and having one sales and trading business is the most efficient and effective way to serve our clients and we'll come back over time with whatever changes that might imply.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. We'll move on. Just one other, in Asia private equity, I wondered, it was helpful, you said over two-thirds of the accrued performance fees were reversed out. I don't know if you want to share what's the dollar amount that's left, just so people could see the downside. But the reality is I just want to make sure, the Asian markets are up already in October.","So does it swing as quickly on the other way if markets hold the year? Would we see a turnaround in the investment line, and maybe you could size the amount of funds in the Asian private equity business?","Jonathan Pruzan","So I think you picked up on one important point. I did say it's about two-thirds of the carry from Asia private equity. I also mentioned that virtually all of the investment line in the IM segment would be driven by that reversal. So hopefully that can give you a rough size.","I'm not going to comment on where that carry will go, going forward. It's obviously going to be based on the investment performance and the valuations in the market. As James said, we have a long history in Asia. We have a strong team. That's been a good business for us.","We're on Asia PE Fund Four, so we've had four separate funds in that market. The first two are effectively finished and delivered strong returns to investors. Fund three, even after the reversal of carry and the performance this quarter is above, its preferred return hurdle, and fund four is really in the investment period, but that is also above book value.","So this has been a strong business for us historically, just had a tough quarter. And again, carry going forward is going to be a function of investments and valuation.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi. I just want to try on that last question again. So what was your write-down on Asia private equity this quarter, since it's so large compared to other quarters? It would be helpful to have that number?","Jonathan Pruzan","What I would say, Mike, is if you look at that line in our supplement there in terms of the investment, it was negative $235 million this quarter versus a positive $232 million in the second quarter.","The two drivers of that is one, virtually all of that negative number can be attributed to the reversal of carry from our Asia PE business, and two, in the second quarter, we saw significant monetization events across the entire fund complex and we didn't see any material monetization events in this quarter. So that's how I would try to size that for you.","Mike Mayo","As it relates to FICC, your RWAs are close to $150 billion. They are down a lot over the last few years. But I thought you said that might start to increase. And there was also a late June Wall Street Journal article that said that Morgan Stanley would weigh more of a comeback in fixed income. So the bigger picture question is, what does Morgan Stanley want to be in FICC?","On the one hand, you have the strategy of UBS, which really has retreated and built the franchise around their wealth management business, and that's really paying off. And I know a lot of investor\u2019s kind of wanted Morgan Stanley to go the route of UBS. On the other hand, you have some large US banks that still want to be the dominant fixed income players.","So which is it, because we're seeing some press reports, some RWA forecasts that imply that you're getting big. And at the same time we see these articles we have, I think it's the worst core FICC quarter since the financial crisis. So if you could provide some more color, that would be helpful?","James Gorman","Well, you're right about the last thing, I think it probably is the worst core FICC since the financial crisis, Mike. And secondly, I think what we said was, if we saw opportunity as some of the non-core assets rolled off, I think there was about $20 billion if memory serves me, that we would be open to utilizing those.","But we certainly weren't expanding from where we are now. So it's more replacement cost or replacement opportunity, if you will, and we're obviously not seeing that opportunity right now. So don't fret too much about that.","On the newspaper article, again if memory serves me, that was something which I found a little bizarre. Actually related to the expansion of the mortgage business that we are doing in wealth management, which has been a phenomenal business, as we take relatively affluent people who have money with us and we re-lend them the money back, because they don't want to create a liquidity event in their portfolio.","And that has been a business with FICO scores I think about 750. Loan to values less than 65%, thereabouts and almost zero, I think we've had one credit loss out of over 20,000 individual loans.","So a pretty spectacular business. For some reason the journalists wrote that headline, that expanding retail mortgage is somehow implied we're expanding mortgage trading in fixed income, and it did not.","We corrected it and they said they understood, but the press had written a story. So don't worry about that. That was completely separate from what we're trying to do.","So the story remains as is. Listen, we have radically restructured our fixed income business from what it was. Clearly, this quarter it did not perform anywhere near where we want and expect and need it to.","The first quarter was very different. The second quarter was about halfway between the two. And watch this space, we're not complacent, but on the other hand, we don't have a knee-jerk reaction based upon a 13 week period, and a very unusual 13 week period at that.","But on the other hand, we're focused on driving up returns to Morgan Stanley. We've been focused on that for many years. We are seeing the results of it on the Wealth Management side.","We had clearly an unusual hiccup in the merchant bank this quarter, which is highly unlikely to repeat itself. And the core banking and equities businesses continued doing what they were doing. So not sure I can add a whole lot more to it.","Mike Mayo","How much do you have in the non-core assets left in FICC?","James Gorman","I don't think we've broken down the total amount. Jon?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. I think, listen. As we said, I think in the beginning of the year, that we had through passive mitigation some level, about $25 billion of assets that would run off over time. As James said, we never committed one way or another what we would do with that passive roll off.","We look at our balance sheet and our businesses holistically. If there are return opportunities across the platform, whether that be equities, fixed income, wealth, we will put those assets to work. But those are basically the sizing of that number, Mike.","James Gorman","And I can promise you one thing. If we do not see opportunity, we will not keep those assets in-house. We will not keep the balance sheet in the position it is.","Mike Mayo","And last question, James, or just a comment. You said a goal for Morgan Stanley is to show better consistency and this quarter did not show that consistency. So how should investors think about this quarter in the context of your goal?","James Gorman","I hope that they would think it in the context of 23 quarters that this management team has presided over. It was a very unusual macro environment. The volatility in China was almost historic.","July was, we're still dealing with will Greece, won't Greece. September was will she, won't she, which was Yellen, and in the middle was China, which went up and down in a six month period at an extraordinary rate, with artificial intervention by the CSRC and other things that really threw the markets sideways.","So I'd like to think that investors would see those things for what they were, and focus on the core business strategy for what it is. We delivered 23% margin on lower revenues in wealth management, which is exactly what we said we would do in strategy.","We had over $500 million in fees in M&A, which is exactly in our wheelhouse of strategy. And we will have, I think when all fully report, the number one equities franchise on the globe, which is exactly what we said we would do in our strategy.","So I'm not making excuses from it. We said right at the outset this was a difficult environment, but a disappointing quarter and it was. And we hold ourselves accountable for that, and we will drive performance as a result of that.","Mike Mayo","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Hi, thanks a lot. Jonathan, just on the wealth management business, if we look at the transaction revenues not just for the quarter, but even year-to-date, looks like they've been weaker. And I don't know if that's a transition of certain accounts into sort of the fee side or if it's just environmental","But I also just wanted to understand, like how significant - you mentioned the deferred comp component, how significant is that for that line item?","Jonathan Pruzan","For that line item specifically, if you look quarter-over-quarter, I think the revenues were down 6%. If you back at the deferred comp impact in both quarters, it would be low single digits. So stable, pretty stable revenues.","The mix as we've talked about in the past is continuation of growth in the NII line, continued year-over-year growth in the managed account line and then some softness in the transactional revenues.","We've seen the volatility in markets and one of the description of the third quarter James left out in August, we saw a 1,000 point drop in the Dow one day. That was not really constructive for our retail engagement numbers.","So there's been a lot of volatility. It's been a softer calendar, and as you said, there's been a shift into some of these managed accounts as well. So all of those are factors.","Michael Carrier","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up on the merchant banking business, I mean, not really on the Asia fund. But when we look at that business and maybe the overall portfolio, I just want to get a sense on the mix of the assets that are in there.","And then it sounds like on the Asia fund, you didn't go under the high watermark or the hurdle. So it was just a negative environment. And so you take the hit and you get the negative carry.","But going forward, if the investments are positive, there's nothing that we should be thinking about differently, meaning, if it's positive, we'll see the positive carry return.","But really want to understand the mix of that business, because when we're in more volatile environments, we can see some quarters where some weird things happen. So any color you could provide there?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. So a couple of things. In terms of - I think in the supplement, we break out where the assets under management are. We have a broad private equity and merchant banking real estate investment business. So you can see the different strategies and the different dollars of assets under management.","In terms of your comment about reversal of carry or then I guess, the restatement of carry going forward, there is - these funds are structured like traditional private equity funds, and there is a phase where you accrue and carry, where there is a catch-up phase that accelerates the accrual of carry, when you go above the preferred return hurdle.","You then - when the carry reverses itself, you have the inverse of that. We saw that in a second half of 2013, where we had the just sort of breaking through that preferred return hurdle, where we had the acceleration, and this was the inverse of that.","And specifically to your last question, we are, on fund three, we are still above our preferred return. So there is still some carry that has been accrued in that fund.","Michael Carrier","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks. Good morning. Jon, quick follow-up on that question on wealth management from Mike with the deferred comp. Can you give us what your margin would be if we backed out the deferred comp noise in the wealth management business?","Jonathan Pruzan","I don't have that number.","Brennan Hawken","But it would probably be a little bit lower than what you reported, right, because it's going to lower your comp by a similar amount as your revenue?","Jonathan Pruzan","Well, it's clearly neutral to the bottom line, and this is a line item that sort of has been running through quarter-to-quarter. So I don't know what the margin would be without it. But it's definitely neutral to the bottom line.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. But it is right just in thinking about it, that it's going to move expenses by the same amount, its right?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. Yes, neutral to the bottom line.","Brennan Hawken","Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then tax rates have been kind of volatile this year. I know it's tricky, but is there any way we should think about the full year here this year on taxes?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. The tax rate has been volatile. We've said in the past it's a function of the geographic mix of earnings. I think we steered you towards 32% last quarter. For the full year, right, there is an adjustment period as the geographic mix, there is the actual mix of earnings based on legal entity versus a managed business, as well as sort of a look forward of what we think that mix is going to look like.","So it is a volatile number, but I would say 32% effective tax rate for the entire year is still what we would say, plus or minus.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thank you. And then lastly on wealth management, you guys saw deposits grow this quarter, was there anything specific driving that?","And then when we think about the loan to deposit ratio, as you guys continue to show nice growth in the loan book. How should we frame loan growth, and where the loan book can get to, based on that?","Jonathan Pruzan","So two questions, I think on the bank deposit program. I did highlight that we saw an increase in $7 billion and that was really based on the volatility in the markets and we saw that investors either stayed or moved into cash, relative to those volatile markets. And as I said, we would expect over time as that volatility abates and their confidence returns, that will be reinvested in the market.","In terms of the loan growth, we have seen good progress against our deposit deployment plan. We still have excess liquidity to deploy. We see a healthy and diversified pipeline. And we continue to expect to grow the loans in the bank. It's primarily going to be driven by wealth management.","It's going to be primarily driven by the mortgage product and the SBL product. And as I said, quarter-over-quarter, we were up $3 billion and year-over-year up $12 billion.","So we still see a healthy pipeline. I would say the penetration rates in terms of FAs engaging with their clients on these products are still high, and we would expect the growth to continue.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. And then, thinking about wealth management and the potential new rule on the Department of Labor's fiduciary proposal. How much of your wealth management client assets are in retirement accounts, and what percentage of those are advisory?","Jonathan Pruzan","So we don't break that out, and obviously the fiduciary duty standard has gotten a lot of attention, and there's been a lot of industry dialogue around it. I think the comment period was extended, and we saw that there were over 300,000 comment letters on this proposal.","We like to provide our clients with choice. We're hoping that the final rules allow us to do that, and we'll wait for those final rules to come out.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. But not anything that you can size for us?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, we will wait for the final rules to come out, and then we'll come back to you.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Last one, just on FICC, sorry to sort of beat this a little bit here. But as \u2013 sort of has been alluded to, equities and wealth management has seemed to have gone well and this is the one business that has continued to draw attention.","And James, I think there's a quote in the press release for you about addressing areas of underperformance. That seems clearly tied to FICC. Is that the right inference? And then does the timing of Ted getting in charge of the FICC business now to tie into this weak quarter and does it also circle back to previous comments that you all have made as being 2015 a really important year for FICC to prove that they can generate good enough results?","James Gorman","A lot of questions in there, Brennan. I think we've probably said all we want to say about FICC. It was one quarter, it was a disappointing quarter. The timing of the organization announcement was not related to this quarter.","The timing of the organization announcement is related to our desire to bring ourselves and trading businesses together, make them as efficient and effective as we can.","We're all working very hard on that. Ted, Collum, myself, Michael Heaney and Rob Rooney in fixed income and all of their team. Listen, I think we've said what we've wanted to say about this quarter. It is what it is and we move forward. We're not here asleep at the wheel.","Brennan Hawken","Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Devin Ryan","Hey, thanks. Good morning. We talked quite a bit about margin targets in GWM. But looking at ISG, it seems to be some pretty big margin tailwinds just from the bank growth and optimization there and then lower funding costs.","Just taking a step back from the challenges of this quarter, how should we think about incremental margin potential in ISG, particularly as you benefit from some of these revenue tailwinds.","I'm trying to think through how much of that benefit will flow to the bottom line versus being reinvested back into other parts of ISG?","Jonathan Pruzan","So on the ISG side, we are clearly focused on expenses and trying to be disciplined there. As I mentioned, the comp ratio at 38% is below our stated target from the beginning of the year.","On the non-comp side, we obviously have the increase in the litigation reserve this quarter. We've also highlighted for you last quarter, called out some professional fees related to the regulatory agenda.","Our hope is that today, when we look back, that we're sort of - we have accomplished more of the regulatory agenda behind us than we have in front of us. But we still have a large regulatory agenda and trying to figure out went those costs abate, is really challenging.","We are very focused on expenses. We're trying to control those expenses that we can control, and we will continue to do that going forward.","Devin Ryan","Okay. And then just within ISG additionally, lending exposure to energy. Can you quantify that, and then any other counterparty exposures related to energy would be helpful?","Jonathan Pruzan","In terms of energy exposure, we do have an institutional lending business, which includes exposure to energy. I would say that our energy exposure quarter-to-quarter hasn't changed materially. Most of the energy lending is to large, multinational corporations and about two thirds of that lending exposure is to investment grade counterparties.","E&P, which is been a big focus of the market, that exposure for us is a much smaller portion of our overall exposure. And approximately half of that - of our E&P exposure is secured, excuse me, by reserves.","Like others, we have seen some deterioration in credit in that portfolio, but we haven't taken any significant losses there. As with all our exposures, we are managing them very tightly. And when appropriate, we are also hedging those exposures.","I would say, given that environment, we would expect continued pressure in this area. But we are focused on it, and we are managing it tightly.","Devin Ryan","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.","Fiona Swaffield","Hi. Good morning. I have two questions. One was on the wealth management net interest income, where in the previous couple of quarters, certainly Q2 you mentioned the realization of the forward curve and your investment securities proposal has been a factor.","I don't know if you could talk us through Q3, Q2 in that respect, within the wealth management net interest income.","And the second area was on the supplementary leverage exposure, the SLR, and the total exposure number. It seems to have gone down. I mean, is there some - have you been successful on reducing add-ons or I think in the past, you talked about securities financing. I just wonder if you could talk a bit about that strategy? Thank you.","Jonathan Pruzan","I'll take the second one first. In terms of the SLR, that's an average calculation and as I said, we saw average assets decline over the quarter. And we continue to make progress on the balance sheet add-ons. So I would say it's a combination of a reduction in average assets, as well as some good work around compression and other things on the add-ons.","The first question around the forward curve, I think what we've said historically is that the growth in NII is primarily driven off of our deposit deployment strategy and taking our excess liquidity out of available for sale securities and putting them into the loan products.","That will be primary driver going forward. Clearly, the forward curve is helpful, as we reinvest our available for sale securities portfolio. I think since we talked last time, I think we probably in an environment of lower, longer - and lower and longer.","So that will have an impact. But again, our NII growth has been primarily driven by the loan growth.","Fiona Swaffield","Can I just follow-up, so if I look to Q3, Q2, there wouldn't have been a negative from AFS or anything like that, it just may have been less positive than in the past couple of quarters?","Jonathan Pruzan","That's probably a reasonable characterization.","Fiona Swaffield","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christian Bolu","Good morning, Jon. Good morning, James.","Jonathan Pruzan","Morning.","James Gorman","Morning.","Christian Bolu","On the relationship lending losses, can you give some more color on what drove that? Was it mostly energy related or more broad-based?","And then just any comments you have, how you feel in terms of your credit metrics of the book would be helpful also?","Jonathan Pruzan","As I did highlight, we did have markdowns on our held for sale relationship and event loans, as a result of the market environment. I wouldn't call out any individual or specific sector or event.","However, I would also highlight that the bottom line impact was minimal, as we hedge many of our fair value loans as appropriate.","Christian Bolu","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then just on wealth management, quick question. FA count ticked up this quarter. Curious if that's just trainees or are you start to see a better environment for advisor recruitment?","Jonathan Pruzan","I would say it's a little bit of lower attrition and a little bit on the trainee side.","Christian Bolu","Okay. Thank you.","Kathleen McCabe","Okay. And with that, I'll bring the call to a close. I thank you all for dialing in. And we look forward to speaking to you again in 13 weeks."],"15060":["Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call April 18, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Sharon Yeshaya - Investor Relations","James Gorman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Analysts","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Glenn Schorr - Evercore","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Mike Mayo - Wells Fargo Securities","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Michael Carrier - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Christian Bolu - Bernstein","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan","Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW","Sharon Yeshaya","Good morning.

During today\u2019s presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com.","Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James Gorman","Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2018 began on a very strong footing. In the first quarter, firm revenues and net income were a record, $11.1 billion and $2.7 billion respectively. The ROE of 14.9% comfortable exceeded our targets, albeit in what is typically a seasonally strong quarter. Importantly, the quarter\u2019s performance demonstrated our inherent operating leverage in an attractive market environment. Results across all businesses were consistently strong.","Our sales and trading businesses performed exceptionally well against the backdrop of heightened volatility and client activity. Equity Sales & Trading benefited from strong volumes across all regions. Return volatility in rates and FX markets provided clients with an opportunity and a catalyst to rebalance their portfolios. This activity combined with the rise in U.S. interest rates and changes in inflation expectations contributed to strong fixed income results. We remain appropriately sized to take advantage of active markets when they present themselves. Investment banking demonstrated sustained strength despite new issue markets being punctuated by periods of elevated volatility.","Wealth management remains solid. For the quarter, the combination of continued advisory growth supported by secular trends and the businesses scale driven operating leverage produced record pretax profit of $1.2 billion. This represents an almost 20% year-on-year increase in PBT with the margin and the range we set to achieve out of the 2 years. At the same time, we continue to actively invest in the business building out our digital offerings, banking products and technology capabilities more broadly.","Investment management again witnessed net long-term inflows over the quarter as the team continues to produce strong investment returns across both alternatives and public markets. We expect attractive returns from investment management in the years ahead particularly as we take advantage of our global platform. In the quarter, we closed the Mesa West acquisition and made several key highs. We have often said that wealth and investment management give us balance and our other businesses make up the engine that drives this going forward in more active markets. That is exactly what we witnessed in the first quarter. For the past several years, a lot of focus has been put on the importance of the stability that wealth management has brought to our firm. This focus has been appropriate. Margins of 26.5% on revenues of $4.4 billion would have been unthinkable just 3 years ago.","However, what is not being discussed as often is our continued commitment to strengthen the institutional securities businesses. In institutional securities alone, the dominance of equities, the strength of fixed income and the breadth of investment banking generated over $6 billion in revenue. Along with the rest of the industry, we recently submitted our 2018 CCAR plan. As is being widely reported, this year\u2019s scenario is more severe than previous years. Of course we don\u2019t have full transparency into the Fed models, but over the years we have seen a reasonable degree of variability. Therefore we are prepared for a range of outcomes this year.","More importantly, beyond this year the Fed Reserve has recently requested comments on several proposed rulemakings. We expect that we and the U.S. financial sector more broadly will benefit from more sensible and less complex regulation. We believe we have sufficiently capitalized and expect to maintain our attractive capital return profiles over the coming years. As we look forward our objectives remain the same to execute on our strategy and deliver on the medium-term goals laid out at the beginning of this year. I am confident that given our business model makes and the competitive strength of our global franchise we are very well-positioned.","I will now turn it over to Jon to discuss the quarter in detail.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you and good morning. The first quarter\u2019s results were strong across businesses and regions. Global markets were active, our institutional securities businesses benefited from increased trading volumes and a return of healthy volatility across many asset classes, while wealth and investment management businesses delivered solid results weathering softer asset prices. Revenues were up 17% sequentially to $11.1 billion, a firm record after excluding the impact of DVA in prior periods. PBT was $3.4 billion, EPS was $1.45, ROE was 14.9% and return on tangible common equity was 17.2%. Total non-interest expense was $7.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year. The increase was driven by a combination of higher compensation expenses and execution related costs associated with higher revenues and business volumes respectively. Continued investment into technology also contributed to the increase. Over that same period revenue growth was 14%. In the quarter the firm efficiency ratio was 69% with all segments contributing to strong operating leverage. The gross-up impact of the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition was not material at the firm level. The details are more fully described in the quarterly supplement.","Now, I will turn to businesses. Institutional securities generated revenues of $6.1 billion. This represents a 35% sequential increase and the best performance for the segment as a whole since 2007. Investment banking, equities and fixed income all contributed to the results. Non-compensation expenses were $1.8 billion for the quarter, a 6% increase driven by higher execution expenses. Compensation expenses were $2.2 billion, representing compensation to net revenue ratio of 35.4%. In investment banking, we have generated revenues of $1.5 billion, a 5% increase over a strong fourth quarter. The results reflect the combination of increased advisory revenues and stability in underwriting, all regions demonstrated strength. Advisory revenues for the quarter were $574 million, up 10% sequentially. Announced M&A volumes have had a strong start to the year. Notably there has been a pickup in both larger and cross-border transactions. Clients remained engaged and pipelines are healthy.","Turning to underwriting, new issue market conditions were more challenged during periods in the quarter, despite doubts of heightened equity volatility, rising interest rates and wider credit spreads, results remain solid. Equity underwriting revenues of $421 million were up 1% sequentially. The market backdrop impacted our ability to convert some of our IPO backlog, but follow-on activity remained robust. Regionally, we witnessed strength in Asia and the Americas. We also saw issuers take advantage of higher volatility through increased convertible issuance. Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 4% sequentially to $518 million. A decrease in high yield financing was offset by increased investment grade issuance. This was supported in part by event driven activity including one large financing we provided together with our partner MUFG. Overall, investment banking pipelines remain healthy and diversified across products, regions and sectors. However, as demonstrated by recent market dynamics future activity may be impacted by regulatory, macro economic and geopolitical factors.","Our sales and trading businesses produced revenues of $4.4 billion, up 64% quarter-over-quarter, increased market activity, strong client engagement and more favorable bid offer spreads particularly during the first half of the quarter drove the improvement in results. In equities, we retained our leadership position and expect to be number one globally. Revenues were $2.6 billion, up 33% sequentially on strength across all products and all regions. Derivatives had a very strong quarter as episodes of volatility created significant trading activity and strong client demand for hedging solutions. A combination of higher client balances and increased engagement generated a sequential rise in prime brokerage revenues. And cash revenues also saw quarter-over-quarter increase benefiting from strong volumes globally particularly in Europe and Asia.","Fixed income was also strong. Revenues in the first quarter were $1.9 billion more than doubling fourth quarter results. While seasonal patterns were a contributing factor, the sharp rise in interest rates in the early part of the quarter heightened volatility levels and the rise in inflation expectations aided activity and our performance. Our macro business performance was solid driven by improved sequential performance across rates in FX. The credit businesses performed well.","Our securitized product group had one of its best quarters in close to 4 years driven by strength in Europe and a more active trading backdrop. Deepening our institutional lending footprint has aided this revenue stream. Commodity revenues were also strong. The results benefited from both an increase in flow activity and more structured transactions, which can be episodic. Fixed income results demonstrate the operational flex in the business and the segment\u2019s ability to service clients in a range of market environments. Average trading VAR for the period was $46 million, up from $38 million in the fourth quarter 2017. The increase was driven by higher market volatility and facilitation of increased client activity.","Turning to wealth management, revenues of $4.4 billion were down 1% quarter-over-quarter as continued growth in asset management was offset by the impact of mark-to-market un-deferred compensation planned investments. Despite lower sequential revenues, the segment produced record pre-tax profit of $1.2 billion resulting in a PBT margin of 26.5%. The 40 basis points of sequential margin increase and 250 basis point uplift compared to last year\u2019s first quarter demonstrates the operating leverage in this scale business. On a year-over-year basis, non-compensation expenses are flat despite an 8% growth in revenues.","Total client assets, was essentially unchanged at $2.4 trillion reflecting softness in domestic and international equity indices. Fee-based assets continue to be a source of long-term organic growth for the business supported by both conversions from brokerage and net new asset flows into the firm. Net fee-based asset flows of $18 billion were strong. As a result, fee-based assets reached a new high of $1.1 trillion or 45% of total client assets. Asset management revenues were $2.5 billion. Positive flows in last quarter\u2019s higher asset levels were partially offset by the effect of fewer calendar days in the quarter.","Net interest income was $1.1 billion. Higher average balances and yields were offset by an increase in funding costs driven primarily by higher rates on our deposits. Lower suite deposit balances also impacted NII as retail clients have continued to deploy cash into the market. Cash in our clients accounts remains at historical lows and equity allocations remain at historic highs hovering around 54% of client assets. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income is up 8%. This has been driven primarily by an increase in wealth management lending in the U.S. banks. Loan balances were up $6.7 billion or 11% with growth across both SBL and mortgage.","In the quarter, loans grew by 1% to $68.3 billion. The more modest space of sequential loan growth was driven by rising rates, deepening pay-downs and a lower level of mortgage production as we transitioned to our in-house origination platform. Retail engagement was strong in the quarter as investors actively repositioned portfolios and responded to market volatility. However, total transaction revenues of $747 million, was down 5% driven principally by the impact of mark-to-market on deferred compensation plans. This quarter\u2019s results underscore the stability of the segment despite gyrations in equity markets and our pace of investment, pre-tax profit reached new highs. We continue to pursue enhancements to our digital capabilities and we are continuously introducing new applications to the organization. Over time, we believe that these advancements will enable our advisors to provide better advice in service and broaden their client relationships.","In investment management, revenues were $718 million, up 13% sequentially driven by higher asset management fees and the assets of last quarter\u2019s impairment charge. Total AUM of $469 billion was down 2% quarter-over-quarter with long-term AUM of $312 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Although we saw outflows in our liquidity business as clients manage their cash balance needs around the turn of the year, our long-term strategy saw continued positive flows. In the quarter, we also closed the Mesa West acquisition, adding private real estate credit capabilities for our platform. Asset management fees of $626 million were up 9% sequentially on the back of higher average AUM for the quarter. We continue to see stability in fee rates earned on our long-term assets. Invested revenues were $77 million, down by 31% relative to last quarter, impacted by lower market performance in certain private equity related funds. Total expenses increased by 2% quarter-over-quarter, largely driven by the revenue recognition gross-up related to this segment.","Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis, total spot assets of $860 billion was essentially flat. As a result of higher lending commitments supporting relationship and event activity in the quarter, our standardized RWAs grew by approximately $12 billion to $389 billion. Basel III standardized common equity Tier 1 ratio is expected to decrease to 15.6%. Our supplementary leverage ratio is expected to remain relatively unchanged at 6.3%. During the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately $1.25 billion of common stock or approximately 22 million shares and our Board declared a $0.25 dividend per share. This morning, we announced the share repurchase plan with MUFG. As part of our regular repurchase program, we will make pro rata purchases directly from MUFG. This will help ensure compliance with their passivity commitments of the Federal Reserve by maintaining their ownership below 24.9%. This will not impact our strategic alliance.","Our tax rate in the first quarter was 20.9% reflecting the reduced U.S. corporate tax rate and benefits associated with share-based payments. Our guidance for the full year remains at 22% to 25%. Since the vast majority of share based award conversions are placed in the first quarter, we expected the tax rate for the remaining quarters to be at the upper end of this range. This quarter demonstrates the strength of our franchise and the benefit of our global business model. As we look forward, we remain confident that we are well-positioned to execute the medium-term strategic objectives that we laid out earlier this year. In the year \u2013 in the near-term we are aware of the fragility of market sentiment. We have emphasized the importance of open and functioning markets as it relates to our performance. This quarter results demonstrate that increased levels of activity and client engagement are broadly beneficial to our business.","With that we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Nomura. Your line is now open.","Steven Chubak","Thanks. Good morning all.","James Gorman","Good morning.","Steven Chubak","So I was hoping to just unpack James some of your comments surrounding the recent proposed changes to capital regime, as we think about the capital constraints that you are looking to manage to longer term, historically you have been a bit more leverage constrained, we now have this enhanced SLR and SEB proposals that are out there and there are some expectation that risk based ratios could once again become a bit more binding. And just based on the new proposals as outlined in your initial read, which constraints are you now more focused on in terms of what informs not just future payout capacity, but also how you are thinking about your balance sheet strategy longer term?","James Gorman","There is \u2013 well, there is a bunch in that, obviously. I think the first point just to reiterate his acknowledgment that this year\u2019s CCAR test or at least the economic scenarios which are driven by the 10% unemployment requirement under Dodd-Frank and when your unemployment is currently run 4%, 4.1% in this country, you need some very severe shocks to hit 10%, so it\u2019s sort of \u2013 it\u2019s an academic approach if you will to achieve an outcome which then generates models which are very severe. So, this year will be kind of interesting to see how it all plays out. We obviously believe we are well capitalized, but we kind of anticipate how all these \u2013 the tests this year will play out. So, what we are really focused on is 2019 ongoing and you are right the SEB buffer comes into play. Historically, you are right, our constraint has been our leverage ratio it\u2019s been \u2013 I think are constrained on every tests going back and maybe not the first one, I can\u2019t remember exactly, but I am pretty sure. And it will remain the constrained under the traditional CCAR model. Under the SEB proposal, I think you are right that the likelihood is that the CET1 ratio would be the constraint rather than the leverage ratio. For Morgan Stanley, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unfriendly news, where it comes out and we are on a common period at the moment, but the Fed Reserve has asked for its sponsors to the multiple road changes and Jon may have something to add to these comments by the way, but the Fed has asked for a comment on that and where that comes out remains to be seen, but I have always found it slightly surreal that the binding constraint would be the balance sheet, debt balance sheet irrespective of the content of assets that comprised that balance sheet. Having a capital as the leverage ratio of cash or treasuries or other forms of government securities versus highly illiquid high-risk securities seems to me the kind of thing one would want to differentiate against.","So, I have always in my mind leverage ratio should have played a \u2013 should have been a secondary ratio to the core capital ratio. So, it\u2019s been just my personal view, because it leads to a very bizarre outcome, but in order to if your constrained as leverage ratio, it might cause you to be very aggressive on the risk-based assets, because frankly, they don\u2019t matter if leverage ratio is your constraint, that\u2019s clearly not an outcome that regulators here or anywhere in the world would want. So, I am kind of welcoming the shift to the SEB model, I think if it translates to Morgan Stanley, which I think it all, the constraint being poor capital, I think that\u2019s more sensible from a regulatory perspective. And I don\u2019t think we are going to be, let me just say, I don\u2019t think we are going to be worse off under that scenario than we are today. Whether and how much better off, but I don\u2019t want to prejudge that.","Steven Chubak","Alright. Thanks, James. As a very comprehensive response, I will switch over to the business side specifically wealth management, it\u2019s certainly encouraging to see continued robust fee-based flows, improvement in pre-tax profitability probably the one area that maybe fell a bit short of our expectation was NII driven in part by slower loan growth. I know you had spoken if some of the factors, including the migration of mortgage originations in-house, but how should we think about the outlook for loan growth in the coming year and maybe against the backdrop of rising funding cost, how does it inform your outlook for the NIM trajectory from here?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. So, I would say that the NII results and lending results were actually in line with our own expectations. I think what we have talked about coming into the \u2013 throughout last year as well as coming into this year was a couple of factors that we suggested would slowdown NII growth in this segment and that\u2019s what we obviously saw this year or this quarter excuse me. We still do believe that we will have good loan growth and that will be a driver of the NII growth going forward. Last year, we grew loans by about $7 billion or $8 billion. Our portfolio is now about $70 billion. So, we will grow probably at a slower pace for the reasons you highlighted the transition and sort of rising rates, but we still think that\u2019s healthy growth on a $70 billion portfolio. We still feel like there is opportunity within our client set if you look at penetration numbers and whatnot that will continue to grow that line, but at a slower pace. We also told you last year that we saw that the deposit deployment strategy that we had in place was going to play out and we were planning on diversifying our deposit and liability structure, which we obviously have done. What we have seen and we talked about this last quarter and again this quarter or excuse me last year, our clients are deploying more cash into the markets and then putting it into different types of investments. The good news is that we still capture those assets when they go into advisory accounts and other transaction-related accounts, but it has brought down our sweep accounts and we have replaced those with higher cost deposits and you are seeing that on the net interest expense line item. The other point I would make just quickly or briefly is that we had seen very receptive network if you will to our new products, particularly around some of the CDs and savings promotions that we have been running. So, we have been able to raise $10 billion odd deposits since last summer albeit at a higher price. So, I think this is actually playing out as we expected and it is going to be growth, but it will be slower.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is now open.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, just wanted to ask another question here on the lending and such, Jon, you highlighted that the institutional lending supported \u2013 or lent some support to big trading results here this quarter. We certainly saw strong growth in the institutional balances here. Is some of this funding that you are doing for CDs being used to fund some of the institutional loan growth, what\u2019s the plan for how long that would stay on the balance sheet and does this provide a pipeline for some DCM activity here in the coming quarters?","Jonathan Pruzan","So a lot of questions in there and I would basically say yes to all of them. But let\u2019s just quickly kick-off. So if you look in our disclosures I think on one of the pages in the supplementary deck has the U.S. banks. You will see that as you mentioned that the institutional lending has increased, a lot of that has been in our Fed secured business or our warehousing businesses which have been very active. There is good velocity in those facilities. We have seen really good strength actually in Europe as we help finance some of our clients to buy some of these portfolios that the banks have been selling. So that has been a good business for us, good velocity, good yield and that is actually financed in the bank. You don\u2019t see that in the net interest income that we talked about in wealth management, because it shows up in the ISG lines. So there is good asset sensitivity and good growth in that line item, it\u2019s just embedded in some of the fixed income and sales and trading line items, so good growth in that area. We continue to see or have the ability to invest in that area and grow that business and it\u2019s been a good source of revenues for us, stable revenues.","Brennan Hawken","Terrific. So, the follow-up would be then I would expect that at least what was certainly volatility supported some of the trading strength here this quarter, there is also some annuitized component to some of the revenue strength here in trading that sits on the balance sheet and another component which you might not have touched upon, so I want to try and get out it different way, is the CD or is the CD is being used to fund this and are those deposit costs being born in the NII line in wealth, but not necessarily getting the benefit of the NII and so it\u2019s just a geography issue, so we are all going to \u2013 my focus on the wealth NII, but you really are generating economics this is not pulling through that line? Thanks.","Jonathan Pruzan","So yes, I mean again within fixed income there are lots of businesses macro and micro corporate trading commodities are within our FPG business, a larger percentage of that that line item over time will be coming from these lending activities. And we have seen good growth in that area. Again, the bank \u2013 the primary funding sources for the bank are deposits and they are being used whether that\u2019s the suite deposit that savings of the time as well as some of the other external sources that we have to fund the institutional part of the lending program. So again, you are right that it is a growing part of that segment, but it\u2019s still relatively small to the overall pie. It does give us some stability and we like the credit characteristics and the yield characteristics of that business and we will continue to try to grow it going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks very much. Just a question historically the whole industry, but Morgan Stanley specifically had big seasonality in the first quarter, I thought a chunk of that had to do with the physical commodities business which is no longer there, but putting aside that this was a more active first quarter in general, you talked about securitized products, you also talked about some structure transactions and commodities, I know it\u2019s an impossible question, but should we be expecting seasonality of the past given that the higher activity levels and those specific components this quarter?","James Gorman","I am glad your processed that by saying it\u2019s an impossible question, which means that actually I am going to go back to Brennan\u2019s question because I realized that and that\u2019s the second part and then Glenn I will get back to you, but\u2026","Jonathan Pruzan","On the NII comment, obviously we transfer price across segments. So, some of the benefit of those deposits is being born in the NII of the banks clearly and how it falls within the segment is ultimately a function of usage in activity level. And now to Glenn, in terms of seasonality, we did exit many of our physical commodities businesses that I would say added to the seasonality because we were generally owners of commodities in oil during the winter with the weather you saw different seasonality components to that business. It\u2019s obviously now a smaller component of it. And generally speaking though, if you look back over 5, 10 years of first quarter has generally been seasonally strong, particularly in ISG sales and trading and whether that\u2019s just because people have new money to invest or they are repositioning for the year or the start of the measurement period in terms of their performance, but there generally has been real seasonality in sales and trading. We clearly saw that in the first quarter this year. If you look at the wallets at least based on some of the early data, it suggests that the equity wallet is up, fixed income wallet is also up, but I think also if you look certainly quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, equity wallet would be up and it looks like fixed income is actually quite balanced.","James Gorman","I just make an observation that yes, historically the first quarter has been the seasonally stronger quarter across Wall Street, but you have got to also take into account what the business mix is. 10 years ago or 12 years ago when I started here, I was running wealth management, I think our revenues in wealth management be in the quarter-to-quarter and our pre-tax at that point was around 3% or something in that order. Obviously, we are in a very different planet now. So, that $4.4 billion plus or minus a quarter and pre-tax over $1 billion, you add wealth, the way I think about this, I had wealth and asset management together and say we start off every quarter at $5 billion in the bank. And then if you think about equities and investment banking have historically, it\u2019s been a long time I think since we have had an equities quarter below $1.5 billion and quite a long time since we have had a banking quarter much below $1 billion, I mean, they have been I think some in the high 900s. So, I think at $2.5 billion pretty much in the bank from those. So, every quarter kind of begins with roughly $7.5 billion. The flex is obviously how strong the markets are reflecting in the new issue calendar which pumps up the banking reflecting in equity activity, depending \u2013 the season, what time of the year it is and then obviously fixed income. And as you correctly point out, the tail that wagged the dog for a while in fixed income was the big physical commodities in some of the very large multiple structured trades we did. A lot of that has gone away. So, fixed income won\u2019t have the huge ups that we had in 2006 and \u201807 most of which we gave back by the way, but it won\u2019t have \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to have the kinds of downs that we had before we got rid of the physical stuff and restructured the business. So, I think the range of this firm is kind of a worst case scenario without the market completely imploding around $7.5 billion a quarter. That was not the case 10 years ago and it was not the case 5 years ago. So, that\u2019s what we are playing for is the sort of balanced and then the speed obviously in a good market, the seasonally strong market, an active market, which we had in the first quarter slightly lower tax rate, slightly lower preferred that we have every other quarter, then you are going to be at the highest end of \u2013 or towards the higher end of your ranges.","Glenn Schorr","I appreciate that much more than I thought. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski of Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Guy Moszkowski","Good morning. James, I think I got the gist of what you were trying to say at the outset when you talked about this year\u2019s CCAR and being prepared for a range, but I think you were trying to send some messages there and I was just hoping that you could elaborate a little bit on what you mean by that versus how you might view future CCARs?","James Gorman","Well, very simply, Guy and I appreciate that follow-up question there. Very simply put, we have increased the dividend I think 4 years in a row and increased the buyback 4 years in a go. We have gone from $0.05 and $0.5 billion to $1 and $5 billion. And this test is, I mean, this is a hard test. If you have to generate a 10% unemployment number and the unemployment is currently 4.1%, you have to provide some pretty extraordinary shocks to hit us. That\u2019s just mathematical, that doesn\u2019t \u2013 I am not saying people actually believe that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. In a scenario it\u2019s certainly much for us than what happened in the financial crisis of \u201808, but that\u2019s the reality of the Dodd Frank legislation and the outcome that has to be generated. We obviously \u2013 the firm has not materially grown in anyway that would suggest we need more capital. The firm is more profitable than it was, so it\u2019s creating more earnings. The firm is operating of the tax rate nearly 10 points below what it was a year ago. The firm has more earnings coming out of wealth management which are more stable. So on any objective assessment, you would say that there is \u2013 we are approaching 100% payout last year, I think we are in the high-90s if memory serves me. You would expect us to be paying out certainly anything that we accrete and some that would be any objective assessment would say that. I am just saying against the backdrop of the way the particular models of this test is splitting out for 2018. And I don\u2019t think this will be the case for 2019. So I want to really separate those discussions. I am saying it\u2019s less clear. I mean we are pretty confident and we will ask for what we think we should be getting and what I think our business throws off, obviously that\u2019s between us and the Federal Reserve until the results are outlined. But I have seen over the years I have seen that PPNR numbers come out at $6.4 billion, that\u2019s a $5.5 billion swing. So I have seen some pretty unusual result over the years and I just can\u2019t predict exactly how it\u2019s going to play out, so I am prepared and I said it very deliberately which you picked up, I am prepared for the range of outcomes for 2018.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay, that\u2019s helpful clarity. Thank you. The other question I just wanted to pick up on that was something that Jonathan mentioned in his remarks was the concept of the bid offer which was up very strongly in the early part of the quarter, I guess across a wide range of products and I would just be interested in a little bit more color on what you saw, where you saw it and in terms of products and areas and to what extent should we think that this has probably normalized already?","James Gorman","Just before he does say, I just want to be clear. We are highly confident in this firm\u2019s capital position. If it was strong last year, it\u2019s stronger now and that\u2019s where we stand as a firm. So there is nothing that I am trying to suggest or indicate that would imply that we don\u2019t feel very strongly about our capital. We have capital sufficient last year by definition every dollar you accrete from then on you would either give back to shareholders and put to good use. So we are highly confident about that position. What I am anticipating is I have been around this track [ph] long enough and made sure enough of these tests and seen enough variability that when you dial the scenario up to the level it got out up it can lead to unintended consequences. Jonathan?","Jonathan Pruzan","I would add you heard, Guy that we repurchased $1 billion in the quarter. This quarter we have a $5 billion authorization that James referenced and it\u2019s our intent to use that authorization in the second quarter. In terms of the bid offer spread, it really anytime you see heightened volatility in the equity markets around some of our market making activities, you would generally see that spread widen out and it\u2019s really just a function of volatility. So as the volatility changes you will see changes in that bid offer spread I think it\u2019s just simple as that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Mike Mayo","Hi, this question might do on the category of no good deed goes unpunished, but you have the biggest gap between your return on equity and your targeted return on equity, so the fact that you are not raising estimates or targets yet, I guess it could be because it\u2019s seasonal or you don\u2019t extrapolate some results because of something you see or because you compete away the tax benefits or you just want to be super-safe especially after your first couple of years and CEO, James, you got started, but you missed a couple of targets and now you are exceeding them and you are exceeding them by wide margin, so why not increased target?","James Gorman","Well, Mike, glad you asked the question, not to correct you, but I will \u2013 actually we had a bigger gap between our return targets and our performance and that was when we generated 2% ROEs and we had a 10% target which if memory serves me you reminded us pretty frequently on these calls. So, it\u2019s a happy gap in the other direction. But seriously, this is an all science, there is \u2013 there are these things called the markets that operate here and we build our business models to function well in bad markets. If Morgan Stanley\u2019s strategy could be defined simply, it would be that we will do fine when the markets are tough and we would do well when the markets are good. There are others who might do better when the markets are good that\u2019s fine. What I care about is how we do when the markets are tough. So, when we put in a target range, we don\u2019t anticipate firstly we would never change it after one quarter and you wouldn\u2019t expect us do it, so it\u2019s I think we called it a medium-term range, so I think about those for a couple of years. So, it would be kind of silly to bounce around after one quarter, but putting that aside, just philosophically, the target range is supposed to represent a normal set of outcomes under kind of tough market environment and a good market environment. This was a very good market environment as we sit right at the outset, not perfect, we can definitely do better. The underwriting calendar was not phenomenal. Wealth management transaction activity is extremely light. We had very few gains in the investment portfolio where we are managing expenses strongly, but not ruthlessly. So, there is things we could do clearly to drive returns higher up putting aside revenue growth. But what we are focused on is how we are going to do in a difficult microenvironment. So, seasonally just add in the extra preferred agreement tax rate up to the sort of 23%, 25% range that Jon talked about and the return to this quarter probably dropped from 14.9% to rough math about 14%. So, think of it as starting basis is 14%, yes, the high end of our target was 13%, but as I said, a very good environment. If we go to the end of this year and we were consistently above 13%, then I will come back to and I am prepared to renegotiate our goals at that point.","Mike Mayo","Fair enough. And one follow-up in terms of environment now that you have $70 billion of loans, up almost 20% year-over-year, how do you reassure investors that these loans will stay of good quality?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, I think from the overall credit quality, there is a couple of components, one is obviously mix, a good portion of that or it\u2019s the vast majority of the wealth management loans, virtually all are secured in one way, shape or form whether that be via house or our bigger portfolios around the security-based lending where we have good LTVs and good data protections. On the mortgages, I think you know our portfolio has been very, very clean and then on the institutional side, again all of that lending is secured. The warehouse business has good structural protections and good haircuts. Our commercial real estate portfolio also has performed nicely in terms of its LTVs and whatnot, but again, we are in a pretty good credit environment. I would suspect at some point we will get into a credit cycle and you will see more losses from that portfolio. But at this point, it\u2019s been very clean. It\u2019s been a good risk return profile with healthy yields and very strong credit characteristics.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Your line is now open.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning. Jon, can you share with us your thoughts on you talked about the mortgage production and moving it in-house may have contributed to some of the slower growth, but I know it\u2019s early, but your clients tend to be obviously higher net worth type of clients. Have you seen any evidence ye that the salt issue when it comes to the state and local taxes and that restriction is impacting people\u2019s borrowing habits on mortgages yet?","Jonathan Pruzan","To be honest, the answer is no. And I know there was a lot of discussion about people moving and particularly at places like California, New York, but we haven\u2019t really seen any activity based on that dynamic. We did obviously \u2013 our provider was PHH, they have changed their business models, so we had to bring change ours. So, we brought it in-house and we have purposely slowed down that production to make sure that we have the right infrastructure and level of client service required for our clients. We still think there is opportunity to grow. As rates rise, we will also see presumably less runoff, but again we feel good about where we are in terms of the lending growth slower first quarter, but as expected.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good and then just pivoting to the trading area in equities, obviously you have made a meaningful commitment to technology in low touch trading versus the traditional high touch trading, can you share with us how those trends are moving, is the high touch trading falling fast and it\u2019s really coming more of a low touch trading environment and which you guys of course are one of the leaders in?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. I think there has been a multiyear trend of more electronic trading versus voice trading. And we have seen that quarter-over-quarter. We benefited obviously this quarter as we have seen that transition. The volumes are going up dramatically and although there is different pricing dynamics around price versus actually the voice versus electronic. We have been making up a lot of it in volume, but there is clearly pressure on the voice trading part of the business.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. Jon, you guys generated good operating leverage in the quarter, comp ratio lower, just on the non-comp side, we expected somewhat with just the activity, but maybe just some color on what\u2019s being driven by activity versus what you guys mentioned on the investments in wealth management like what we should be expecting is more ongoing?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, I think based on sort of our expectations in budgets, we actually were right in line with sort of what our expectations were on sort of the non-revenue related items and then we feel a clearly increase in BC&E which shows up in the BC&E line, an increase in transaction taxes, increases in UK bank levy and some of the other things that would show up in the other expense line. So where we expected the increase is we had a little bit of increase in occupancy as we knew we were renegotiating some leases. We have got some expenses related to some of the planning we are doing in Brexit. So again all of the expected slight increases that we felt we would have, we saw and then the real increase in expenses was virtually all related to the sales and trading and revenue related activities.","Michael Carrier","Okay, got it. And then just as a follow-up on the capital ratios in the stress capital buffer, I just wanted to give or take given that it will be more variable or volatile going forward, do you expect some more transparency in the calculation of the test and if you get that then can you better manage like the current kind of portfolio in the business to maybe navigate that better over the next few years and I know it\u2019s early, but\u2026?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, I would say it\u2019s very early, I would say there have been a couple of announcements and Vice Chairman, Carla has testified yesterday or day before and made some comments. I think there is clearly a trend towards simplification. There is a trend towards more transparency. There is a trend towards more bespoke regulation based on your own individual firm risk profile. And there is an element of recalibration 10 years after the fact. And I think transparency for us that might lead to better stability would really be transparency around the actual scenarios. We have seen this test get harder year-after-year as James mentioned at 10% unemployment rate, but also every year when we get there scenarios and upfront market shock in the past, there is always a couple of things in there that surprised us and to be fair are not necessarily are 100% consistent with how we see the world and what would happen in a scenario like that. So anything around transparency, around the scenarios and that\u2019s one of things that we are going to comment on. And I think Vice Chairman, Carla has mentioned something about putting out the scenarios for comment. I mean any of that would be helpful for us to plan our business, because we look at things for the longer term and to get a surprise year-after-year based on sort of the scenario does obviously inhibit that \u2013 some of that long-term strategy planning.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Jim Mitchell","Good morning, just a follow-up on that, you guys, James as you said you have built more stable you think stable kind of revenue producing business model you had when we look at the stress test, you get hit the hardest in terms of starting point to stress minimum in terms of loss rates that seems, it doesn\u2019t seem to jive with what you have built and just therefore you get hit hardest in this SEB even though you have plenty of capital. How do you \u2013 is there anything we can view think about or going forward that you can sort of help the Fed or help yourself kind of reduce the higher losses that they attribute to your firm, how do we think about offsets going forward or how do you think about it?","Jonathan Pruzan","This is \u2013 I will try to take a chance. Again, the transparency in their models and one of the uncertainty this year is they are continuing this sort of 2-year phase-in transition on some of their PPNR models. As James mentioned, we think we have created a much more stable revenue base yet in the stress cases that they have prepared, our PPNR has been a wildly unpredictable and wildly low. Some of that this year is going to be a function as you know are of significant portion of our revenues in wealth comes from our fee-based flows and if your markets are down 65% and they don\u2019t ever recover, that obviously has an impact on our business. The other thing you should know is all these tests were not allowed to do make any sort of management actions. So, we just watch all of this go on and have no ability to react to it. So, we do have a high reduction. Also, some of that has to do with just our RWA density is lower than everyone else\u2019s and that while it intuitively means that we have less risk doesn\u2019t seem to benefit from the tests, which is also one of the reasons why I think \u2013 and I think Vice Chairman, Carla has mentioned this yesterday, we do think that a recalibration of the GCIP methodology, particularly MiFID II would be helpful. Our de-risking strategy has led to a higher GCIP buffer, which intuitively doesn\u2019t make sense and we have got a pretty big gap between the MiFID I and MiFID II and so those are some of the types of things that we would like to comment on going forward in this process.","James Gorman","And just specifically on us historically as we said, the constraint was leverage ratio. And if \u2013 as the models in the Fed have done, you grow your balance sheet, then that\u2019s highly punitive. I think it\u2019s been growing 4.3%, 4.5% a year. So, I have said this publicly and I have said it privately, I don\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t anticipate a scenario, where your balance sheet grows during the time of financial distress and deflation of financial assets unless you are requiring other institutions, that just is illogical and I have seen no empirical evidence to support balance sheet growth during that time period. And I think that view has started to resonate. And I think Vice Chair, Carla has talked about some of that in one of his speeches recently as they are considering moving to the stress buffer model. But I think in fact our experience was I think our balance sheet strength of memory, certainly 29% post-crisis. So, under that we would be wildly overcapitalized from a leverage ratio perspective. Now, I am not suggesting that, that\u2019s appropriate to model it in that regard, because obviously we took very draconian steps because we had to and a stronger institution might take less return draconian steps and we believe we are a stronger institution now. But the bottom line is we have always had the constraint to leverage ratio if you took away the balance sheet growth and just kept it flat, we wouldn\u2019t even be having this discussion.","Jim Mitchell","Right, absolutely. Thanks for that. And then maybe a follow-up on just as awful chatter about the Volcker rule, I don\u2019t know when you talked to your traders, has the uncertainty and complexity of that rule kind of hurt them in anyway, do they feel like some greater simplicity would help a lot or just a little, I mean, is it more of an expense issue? Just trying to think through if there is any kind of material impact where the revenue and expense is from some simplicity in the Volcker rule?","James Gorman","Yes, it\u2019s probably going to take too long to pull apart all the aspects of the Volcker rule for this call. So, just given the time, I won\u2019t go into it, but clearly what Paul Volcker was trying to do was restrict deposit-taking institutions from putting their own capital at risk in proprietary trading or investing and it walked into something, which is far more complex requires a lot of attestations and many people\u2019s view has impinged on lack of liquidity and move from focused on proprietary activity to principal trading activity. I think the regulators are obviously very aware of the industry response on this and this is an opportunity where they are taking a hard look at it. I do not expect the Volcker rule to be removed. I am not sure it should be removed, because I am not sure banks should point large parts of their capital at risk in proprietary trading or proprietary investment position. So the essence of what Volcker was trying to do I would personally agree with, the way in which it was executed left some revision would be appropriate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Christian Bolu","Good morning James. Good morning Jonathan. Thanks for squeezing me in here. On the wealth management side, just want to follow-up on the NII questions, I guess just to wrap it all up, how should we think about sequential quarter progress going forward, should we be thinking about growth for Q1 base and also if you have the deposit, the brokering deposit number for the quarter that would be helpful also?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure and again the way I would describe this first of all I think you have heard James talk a lot about this business being balanced, so it\u2019s not going to move quarter-over-quarter sequentially very much, that\u2019s why we like it a lot, it sort of grinds it out. If you look over the year-over-year comparison, NII is up 8% driven by very nice loan growth. And I would say going forward, we have \u2013 I have tried to highlight in this call that the loan growth to be at a slower rate than last year. We are also up of a bigger base and we are also not going to get the benefit of sort of the lower betas or the betas \u2013 actual betas sort of below sort of the predicted model beta is 50%, I think we are going to start seeing the betas and we already have creep up towards that 50% type of level. So again, we do expect NII growth, it will be slower than we have had over the last 5 years. I mean we have tripled our loan portfolio in 5 years. We clearly can\u2019t continue with that clip as we started with a lot of new products and a lot of new strategies. But we will continue to see growth just at a slower pace.","Christian Bolu","Okay. Just sorry the growth is sequential or year-over-year growth, I guess that\u2019s what I am trying to\u2026?","James Gorman","I am sorry, when we talk about NII growth, we are talking year-over-year, so if you look at historically we have been growing NII year-over-year on average $500 million, we are clearly telling you that we are going to grow NII in \u201818 versus \u201817, but it\u2019s going to be at a slower pace.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Kian Abouhossein","Yes. It\u2019s Kian Abouhossein, securitized products you mentioned it\u2019s one of the best performances you have seen over the last 4 years and I was just wondering why that is because I wouldn\u2019t expect that looking at industry data and you particularly highlighted Europe in that context as well which historically is a very small part at least if you look at that logic data in terms of revenues, issuance revenues, I am just wondering what is driving that for you, it looks like you are gaining market share, so I want to understand what you are doing in globally, but also in Europe in particular in this area?","James Gorman","Again, I would say broadly fixed income was strong. There weren\u2019t a lot of elephant type transactions in the quarter, so it\u2019s really just sort of small out-performance in a lot of places across the globe, number one. In terms of FPG and one of the things that we highlighted, Europe is again in this \u2013 in our warehouse business we have been very active supporting clients as some of the larger banks have been getting out of real estate portfolios as they continue to de-leverage and we been providing financing for European clients, that\u2019s been a very good business for us. We obviously some combination of both syndicating out that exposure, but also securitization activity on the back of it has been very good for us. So again, I called out FPG just because if you look at percentages it did sort of outshine if you will the other areas with both fixed \u2013 excuse me, FX and commodities, but it wasn\u2019t \u2013 it was just a little bit better in a lot of different places all overall the world across products and that geographies.","Operator","Thank you. And the last question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Your line is now open.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yes. Thanks. Just had a quick question on the wealth management space, we saw that the reps were down 1% year-on-year, I mean going forward is that just the right way to think about your advisors in that business, there is going to be a declining based from here or will there be a some point we can actually see growth in advisors?","Jonathan Pruzan","I mean I think generally the attrition has been pretty low 1% is a relatively small number given the size of the franchise with the ages and retirements and some people still leaving. What we have seen to-date this year is actually a significant slowdown in the number of people who have had left. Generally, the size of the production of the people who have been leaving has been quite low. We have deemphasized recruiting. We have only recruited a handful of people over the first quarter, but I think generally speaking flattish and plus or minus 1%, I sort of bucket into the flattest categories sort of how we see this certainly in the near term as we continue to invest in our current franchise, our current FAs and our current infrastructure.","James Gorman","Yes. I would focus on total assets and assets per adviser more than the number of advisers, but you won\u2019t see radical shifts in numbers. We are at the last question I know there are other people on the line, I am sorry about that, we went a little longer on some of these questions early, because they were a little more dense. So, if you need to cause your own, then please do. We will answer everybody\u2019s questions offline. Thank you so much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. That concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"15058":["Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Q4 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call January 17, 2018  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Sharon Yeshaya - IR","James Gorman - Chairman and CEO","Jonathan Pruzan - CFO and EVP","Conference Call Participants","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Mike Mayo - Wells Fargo","Steven Chubak - Wolfe Research","Christian Bolu - Bernstein","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Alevizos Alevizakos - HSBC","Sharon Yeshaya","Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During today's presentation, we'll be referring to our earnings release, financial supplement, and strategic update. Copies of which are available at www.morganstanley.com.","Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and strategic update. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James Gorman","Thank you, Sharon. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2018 was a great year that finished on a disappointing note. For the first nine months, Morgan Stanley performed strongly. That translated into full year results that included record revenues, record pretax profit and record net earnings. Some of those results are listed on slide three and are worth noting.","That said, the last six weeks of the year in particular were obviously difficult. That combined with some idiosyncratic items that we'll go through produced a below target ROE of 7.7% for the fourth quarter. In a moment, Jon will take you through the details of the quarter. Importantly, we do not believe the fourth quarter is a new normal. In fact, while it's early days, the first quarter has started on a similar path to the start of the first quarter of 2018.","Now, let me transition and take you through our strategic update presentation so you can get a clearer sense of our direction, performance objectives, and specific action steps. To start, let's review 2018 against our 2018-2019 objectives. So, please turn to slide four. As you can see on the right hand side, our results are generally in line with our target ranges. Regarding Investment Management, it's fair to say we are positioning the business for growth, but it's still early days.","On capital return, we increased our dividend to $0.30 per share and had a buyback of $4.9 billion. The results of 2018 CCAR translated into a flat total capital distribution to 2017 CCAR, a position we believe we can improve upon going forward.","Moving to slide five, stability is critical when markets are volatile. When we look to reshape Morgan Stanley, our objective was to shift the firm towards more relatively stable sources of revenue.","In our view, relatively stable sources of revenue represent those associated with fee-based pricing arrangements, financing, and lending. These are streams that have generally less susceptible to significant variation when faced with market volatility. The results of these efforts are apparent. By design, the increased contribution to firm-wide revenues from these sources should help support a base level of profitability during periods of extended market disruption.","As shown on slide six, capital actions have allowed us to improve our dividend and reduced our share count. Our returns are now exceeding our cost of capital and we continue to have a sufficient capital base. In the future, subject to regulatory approval, we expect to increase our capital return while simultaneously investing in our business for growth.","Slide seven outlines some of our growth objectives. Our dual mission is to drive growth and further enhance the stability of our business.","If you turn to slide eight, please. From an institutional perspective, we are happy with our footprint and we'll continue to invest in product and geographic offerings that support our client base.","Our competitive position is strong and we're confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities. We believe that the stability of our team and business model compared to an industry, much of which is still going through change, should enable us to continue to take market share.","Moving to slide nine, while the strength of the U.S. economy has been the primary driver of global growth over the last several years, we expect Asia to play a greater role in the next decade. Our existing strong footprint in Institutional Securities, coupled with our growth initiatives, will position us to capitalize on this expected regional growth and wealth creation, particularly as capital markets become a more important source of financing.","Over time, we expect to move to a majority ownership position of our securities joint venture in China. A global corporation of our size should be able to control its own destiny.","On slide 10, as we think about growth in Asia, we shouldn't lose focus of Japan, the world's third-largest economy. We've had a unique partnership with MUFG for almost nine years. As a result, our joint venture has the second largest share in that market.","Further, our partnership has enabled us to provide material financing for clients globally, bringing each of our firm's balance sheet to bear. We work together in over 600 transactions.","Now, shifting the wealth management on slide 11. We have long discussed the relative stability of this revenue base. Scale advantages don't improve the story, resulting in a material increase in average sale in revenues over time.","Looking to the left hand of the slide, on an average basis, 91% of trading days in 2018 saw revenues above $60 million compared to 81% of trading days being below that same threshold in just 2013.","Higher average daily revenues, supported by scale and the added benefit of U.S. tax reform, have improved the segment's contribution to the firm's net income. The ROE of that business almost doubled to 20% over the last six years.","On slide 12, the industry has experienced a secular shift away from transactional towards advisory accounts with serve as fee-based assets. We've witnessed a meaningful increase in the allocation of assets towards advisory and expect this trend to continue in the medium term, albeit, of course, at a slower pace. This shift has reduced our reliance on transactional revenue.","Over time, we believe over half of total client assets will be in advisory. As shown on the right-hand side of the slide, the pool of advisory assets is well diversified. While we're not immune to market downturns, portfolio diversification should help smooth performance over time as all asset classes generally do not move in tandem.","Slide 13 outlines the evolution of our investments into Wealth Management. While we recognize that many of our clients split their wealth amongst several different firms, the technology we have developed creates a compelling rationale for clients to consolidate assets with us.","We believe this -- we consider this consolidation to be a meaningful growth opportunity going forward. Notably, we've been able to invest in these capabilities while continuing to grow our pretax margin, our pretax income, and expand our margin.","The trade-off between revenue growth and margin expansion is important. This year, we would be more interested in driving higher revenue growth within this margin range that we've been public on to necessarily exceed the [audio gap]. Many of you have seen our new technology capabilities, which we believe will elevate our offering.","We plan to further enhance our digital tools as we expand and leverage our Stock Plan channel to convert more leads into new clients. We expect this channel to provide us with another opportunity for growth over the medium term.","Additionally, we're open to acquisitions. These types of additions could enable us to pursue new client segments through alternative channels or accelerate our growth efforts in our core channel.","Now moving to slide 14. The U.S. Bank has afforded us the ability to further provide services to our client base, both in Wealth Management and Institutional Securities. As illustrated on this page, we continue to increase our high-quality lending book.","In Wealth, we moved our mortgage origination platform in-house this year and while we intentionally slowed production temporarily to ensure a successful transition, we now have full control of the product's quality and customer experience. We expect to increase our mortgage penetration and have a strong footing in securities-based lending products with our clients.","Within the Institutional business, while we're cognizant of the risk in the market, including commercial real estate, we have a diversified portfolio that is well-structured and secured. As always, we aim to maintain a high-quality book of secured loans and maintain strong velocity of balance sheet.","Shifting the page to Investment Management, as we noted last year, Investment Management is a business positioned for growth and we're executing on that opportunity as evidenced by strong growth in our asset management fees since we refocused our efforts on Investment Management in late 2015.","Across our business lines, we're seeing strong investment performance while managing client partnerships and distribution and continued product innovation. The focus remains on these drivers to continue our organic growth. A key part of the strategy also includes inorganic growth, driven by new talent, team lift-outs, and acquisitions in areas we believe we can deliver differentiated value to our clients.","Taken as a whole, slide 16 illustrates the operating leverage of this institution. Expense management is absolutely necessary in this industry given the volatility of revenues. We will continue to focus on driving further operating leverage and increase expense management.","Please turn to slide 17. Last year, we established clear strategic objectives for 2018 and 2019, all of which we met, or were in the range of, during the full year 2018. Within the year, we saw patches of over-performance as well as underperformance, obviously, in the fourth quarter. The net result of an 11.5% ROE, excluding intermittent discrete tax items, demonstrates that we're on the right track.","Notwithstanding 2018 finishing as it did, we maintain our ROE and ROTCE target ranges for 2019 and continue to believe the business is well positioned to meet those goals.","Regarding our Wealth Management objective, in constructive markets, the Wealth Management pretax margin of 28% is not a limit. Our margin will be a function of the market and the choices we make on when and how to invest for growth.","That said, as I said earlier, it doesn't serve us well to only focus on margin. We are very focused on absolute PBT growth. Additionally, we will utilize our capital base to support organic and inorganic business initiatives.","For the first time since the financial crisis and the acquisition of Smith Barney, we bought a business in 2018, Mesa West, a small business but a test to find the right way to complement what we're doing in Investment Management. The transaction was successful and the ease of integration exceeded our expectations. We will be looking for similar bolt-on acquisitions within both our Wealth and Investment Management businesses.","Lastly, while not a point of growth, we reiterate that given our business mix and model and our capital base, we will look to achieve 100% payout ratio going forward, subject obviously, to regulatory approval and any acquisition opportunities that may come our way.","Our management team remains committed to executing on our long-term strategy and fulfilling our strategic objectives. We are confident in this institution's ability to deliver both future profitability and performance at the levels that we've outlined.","I'm going to now turn the call over to Jon, who will talk about the fourth quarter in detail, the annual results, and then, of course, we'll take your questions.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you and good morning. The fourth quarter was difficult. While the quarter started off well, during the second half, we saw a pickup in volatility and sharp corrections across asset classes.","Intraday and intraweek volatility impacted the underwriting calendar and challenged our market-making businesses. Against this backdrop, we reported revenues of $8.5 billion and PBT of $1.9 billion. EPS was $0.80, ROE was 7.7%, and ROTCE was 8.8%.","In addition to the challenging market dynamics, factors specific to Morgan Stanley further impacted quarterly results. Namely, sharp losses to the investments associated with employee deferred compensation plans had a considerable impact on transactional revenues in Wealth Management.","Additionally, we made slight modifications to the firm's incentive compensation, subject to deferral schedules in order to bring them more in line with peers. Although these factors are not material to the annual results, adjustments can be amplified in any given quarter and impact the segments in slightly different ways.","Now, to the businesses. Our Institutional Securities business reported revenues of $3.8 billion in the quarter, a 22% sequential decline. Sales and trading and underwriting results were both impacted by violent market swings at the end of the year. We saw clients de-risk and delever in the second half of the quarter.","Advisory, however, remained strong and we had our best quarterly results in over 10 years. For the full year, ISG revenues increased 9% to $20.6 billion. This represents the seventh consecutive year of growth ex DVA, underscoring the power of this franchise. Non-compensation expenses of $1.9 billion increased 8% versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by execution-related costs and seasonality.","While the difficult backdrop weighed on market-making, client activity remained robust. These flows had commensurate transaction-related expenses. The compensation ratio for the quarter and full year was approximately 31% and 34% respectively.","Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion declined modestly from the prior quarter, consistent with lower industry volumes. Strength in advisory was offset by declines in underwriting, particularly in the weeks following Thanksgiving.","Full year Investment Banking revenues of $6.1 billion increased 10% and are the highest on record. Advisory revenues increased 44% versus the third quarter. Full year advisory revenues of $2.4 billion are the second highest ever.","Sequentially, equity and debt underwriting revenue saw declines, consistent with lower new issue volumes in both products. On a full year basis, we had our best year of underwriting revenues at $3.7 billion as the equity product had its best year in a decade.","Overall, the Investment Banking pipelines and backlogs remain healthy and comparable to the same time last year. That said, persistent volatility and changes to sentiment could impact our ability to bring transactions to market.","In equities, the business performed well. Revenues declined 4% on a sequential basis to $1.9 billion. Volatile market conditions, including the severity of intraday and intraweek movements, impacted performance in cash and derivatives in the fourth quarter.","In prime brokerage, results remained strong. While balances declined, revenues were supported by strong transactional activity in the first half of the quarter. For the full year, equities revenues were the strongest in over a decade, increasing 12% to $9 billion. We expect to retain our leadership position and finish number one globally for the fifth consecutive year.","Fixed income results for the quarter were weak against a challenging market backdrop. Fourth quarter revenues were $564 million. The weakness was driven by both credit and macro.","Both seasonal factors and increased economic uncertainty related to growth and rate outlooks for 2019 and beyond influenced markets, resulting in rapid movements in spreads and asset prices. Credit was impacted by significant widening of spreads towards the end of the year.","Macro results were also disappointing, as a breakdown in historical relationships weighed on revenues. In both cases, unfavorable market conditions resulted in losses as we supported our clients.","While commodities represents a smaller part of our fixed income footprint, the segment performed well on the back of strong client activity. We restructured fixed income over three years ago, and since 2016, the wallet has shrunk by over 10%.","Despite this market dynamic, we have produced approximately $5 billion of revenue each year and gained market share. We are critically and credibly sized for the opportunity and are well-positioned to continue to support our clients.","Wealth Management finished a strong year on a weak note, impacted by the decline in asset prices and the impact of market volatility on investment banking revenues. Overall segment revenues were $4.1 billion for the quarter.","Over the last several years, the impacts from our employee deferred compensation plans have had limited impact on both revenues and pretax margin, but this quarter, losses on deferred compensation plan investments had an outsized impact of over 5% to the revenue line. Fourth quarter revenues, including revenue impacts of DCP for all periods, were in line with both third quarter 2018 and fourth quarter 2017.","Full year results highlight the business' operating leverage. Year-over-year revenues, excluding the DCP revenue impacts, grew approximately 5%. By comparison, total non-compensation expenses grew only 1%. The growth in annual revenues and the limited increase to non-comp expenses while still investing in the platform highlight the business' extraordinary benefit of scale.","The PBT margin was 24.4% for the quarter. The margin was impacted by the difficult environment, increased seasonal expenses, the adjustments to the deferral schedule of discretionary incentive compensation, and the impacts of DCP.","Absent these impacts, the margin would have been more in line with our annual results. For the full year, Wealth Management produced a PBT margin of 26.2%. Transactional revenues were $422 million, down $276 million sequentially. The DCP impacts accounted for more than the sequential decline.","Asset Management revenues were unchanged versus the prior quarter. Higher asset levels at the end of the third quarter helped insulate these revenues against the market decline in the fourth quarter.","However, not all assets are priced in the beginning of the quarter. And on a full year basis, Asset Management revenues increased 9%, a function of higher fee-based client assets driven by markets and flows.","Total client assets of $2.3 trillion in the fourth quarter decreased 8% sequentially, reflective of broader market movements. We continue to see positive fee-based asset flows, with fee-based assets now representing 45% of total client assets.","Total U.S. Bank deposits of $187 billion increased 7% versus the third quarter, driven by higher deposit sweep balances. In particular, our bank deposit program benefited from seasonality and clients holding more cash in the face of volatile markets.","Net interest income of $1.1 billion increased 2% versus the prior quarter and 4% over the full year. We expect 2019 annual NII growth to be in line with the loan growth.","Given the number of factors that can distort any individual quarter, we continue to manage this business with a long-term lens. Key indicators of the business' strength remain intact. Increased lending penetration, the adoption of digital tools, fee-based asset flows, and minimal attrition indicate an engaged financial adviser population and a business positioned to grow. We would expect the margin to rebound in the first quarter, and we are confident in our ability to deliver our 26% to 28% margin objective in 2019.","Investment Management reported revenues of $684 million, a 5% increase sequentially. For the full year, revenues of $2.7 billion were up 6%.","Asset management fees of $628 million grew 4% versus the third quarter, driven by a significant amount of the year's performance fees being recognized in the fourth quarter. This increase was a result of the revenue recognition accounting rule change implemented early this year. The increase was partially offset by declines in management fees, which were impacted by lower average AUM. On a full year basis, asset management fees increased a very healthy 12%, reaching $2.5 billion.","Investment revenues increased on a sequential basis, primarily driven by our private investments within our funds. As we have previously said, this line has the potential to be lumpy, though we continue to see broad-based gains in our private alternative strategies. Other revenues were impacted by an impairment of a legacy, non-controlling interest in a third-party asset manager.","In 2018, we integrated our first acquisition, had positive annual long term flows and a very strong fundraising year, underscoring the health of our franchise. We continue to look for organic and inorganic opportunities to grow this business.","Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis, total spot assets of $854 billion were down from $866 billion on the back of lower client balances and inventory. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 26 million shares or $1.2 billion of common stock and our Board declared a $0.30 dividend per share.","Our tax rates for the quarter and full year were 22.1% and 22.7% respectively, excluding $111 million and $203 million of intermittent tax discrete benefits in the relevant periods. We expect a similar tax rate in 2019.","Turning to the outlook, we recognize that the environment has become more uncertain than last year. Despite the potential for varying backdrops, we're confident in our ability to execute on our stated strategic objectives.","While we cannot predict how these dynamics will unfold in 2019, we're focused on growing and supporting our clients and are prepared to respond to market environments with appropriate actions.","Although the asset pricing witnessed at the end of the year will have an impact on first quarter results, markets have settled into tighter ranges and historical relationships that broke down in the fourth quarter have realigned. The market backdrop we saw in November and December has been replaced by a clearly more constructive tone.","With that, we will now open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Your line is open.","Guy Moszkowski","Good morning.","James Gorman","Good morning.","Guy Moszkowski","The first question I wanted to ask was just -- I recognize that, in Wealth Management, there were some moving parts that had to do with two different deferred comp programs, one being the one that affects both the expense and the revenue lines equally, and we've seen that before. But it appears that there was another one that had a onetime impact on costs. And I was hoping that you could tease out for us more the numerical impacts of both of those and maybe a more fulsome explanation of the one-time element with respect to deferred comp just so we can understand it better.","James Gorman","Maybe I'll talk about the -- what was behind the philosophy and then Jon can tell you whatever he can tell you about the numerical aspects of it. We've had, I would say, a very aggressive deferral program for a number of years. Back several years ago, we just thought it was a little over the top and we were pushing too much -- frankly, too much revenue into future years, which is mortgaging your future and not healthy. And we adjusted that one time.","In the last couple of years, with particularly our more junior employees at the sort of associate VP level, if you looked at where they were deferred relative to The Street, they were clearly an outlier. And these are young folks and that just didn't feel appropriate.","We made those changes, it affected obviously -- just given the mix of our business and the compensation mix; it affects the institutional business in aggregate more than it does the other businesses just because it's a much bigger with the bonus pool. But it also affects anybody who's at those more junior levels across the Board.","And the -- so we made that adjustment. It obviously brings up your comp expense and affects the -- and given that's an adjustment for the full year, the fact is hits in one quarter affects that quarter disproportionately.","So, the sort of business rationale for employees and being appropriately placed in the market for the younger folks makes a lot of sense. It helps with attrition. Clearly, it has an impact, not life-changing, but that has an impact on a business where one point of margin is $40 million, $45 million. It has an impact on a business of that kind.","On the other side of it, it's bringing compensation this year, not next year and the year after. So, it has the other side of the equation, too. So, that was the rationale behind it, Guy.","Guy Moszkowski","Thanks. And just in terms of the numerical impact?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, I'll try -- there were two separate impacts. One was the DCP. So, the deferred cash that our employees invest while they wait until it vests. That had the significant impact on the revenues that I mentioned, over 5% in the quarter. That had a more limited impact on the PBT. And again, over a long period of time -- excuse me, over the annual basis, the deferred comp plans have generally been pretty -- have not really impacted the PBT, but we did obviously see a 14% decrease in the S&P in the quarter.","And within Wealth, based on the mix of how those employees invest their assets and the deferral schedules, you saw a bigger revenue impact there. On the one-time change and the adjustment, as James said, it's magnified because of the quarter. In any one quarter -- and I would -- as I mentioned in my script, if you take those as well as the seasonality as well as some of the volatility we saw in the Investment Banking or I guess, in the calendar revenue, which you can see in the supplement, the margin would have been closer to the full year margin, had those impacts not occurred.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks very much. Just looking for a little color on the inorganic potential in Investment Management. I think we all know the tough world and backdrop on the traditional side of the business. We know that Morgan Stanley sold the retail component of its business and the alternative world is growing.","So, you gave us a look on check mark in each asset class. But can we sharpen that a little -- focus a little bit more and say why now? What particular focus? And then maybe how you think about investing in that business versus say buying back stock at book value?","James Gorman","Yes. I mean, if the stock stays at -- if the stock's at $42 or whatever it is going to open up this morning, that's a -- I kind of like buying that all day long, to be blunt. So, yes, I do but I'm trying to think a little longer than what's going on today and tomorrow.","Listen, the Investment Management platform is very interesting. We are -- I think as the slide shows, we have a very good long-only business. Dennis Lynch has been number one Morningstar. So, I think two of the last four years has had great flows and we've had -- we've got a great deep value team led by William Lock in London and a bunch of other teams. So, we have a very strong performance in that business. We had very good flows into managed equities, which is -- and obviously, The Street did not experience that, so that's a positive.","Our fixed income business has typically been a small -- not typically, it is smaller than we would like. It's more of a scale-driven business, as you know. So, I see opportunities where if we could build out and acquire teams and\/or small add-on firms to build out the equity or the fixed income side that would be very interesting. Put liquidity aside for a minute.","In the Alternatives space, and that's where we did the commercial real estate transaction with Mesa West, the California firm. We give them global reach. I think that integration has gone really well. That was sort of our little test tube, getting our foot back in the water. I think it was a couple of hundred million dollars, just to get a sense of it. And I think that's going great.","And those -- so whether it's across that real estate platform, our private equity platform, our Asia PE platform, our mezzanine platform, the infrastructure funds, we've now got two $4 billion infrastructure funds, the real estate business has bounced back, there are a lot of spaces, Glenn, where we can add on.","Now, we're not suggesting we're about to do a megadeal in Asset Management and you and I and everybody else knows those are complicated and not all of those have been successful over time. But what we are focused on is -- we're fortunate to have a platform that plays in pretty much every space, including, by the way, fund of funds, which I didn't mention. We have real estate and private equity fund of funds, hedge fund fund of funds.","So, we plan all of those, and if we can drop in a series of -- sort of string-of-pearl type acquisitions across the platform while we're driving organic growth in the actively managed, which is the higher margin business, get better scale in the fixed income platform and do this over a period of years and not look for a single answer but a series of answers, I think there's a lot of space in there. And I think Dan and his team -- I was over there a couple of days ago with the team and I think they're -- they've got the program working well.","Glenn Schorr","Appreciate that. A quickie on trading. I heard all your comments on equities, but -- I know we won't get numbers, but in general, could we -- could you comment on like how much client deleveraging and lower volumes impacts things versus trying to stand up and facilitate for clients and just taking some hits along the way when the market is falling like a rock?","Jonathan Pruzan","I think that was a good characterization. First of all, that business performed extraordinarily well we'll be number one. Again, for the fifth consecutive year, we maintained our leading share in a market that grew probably about 10%. So, it was a good overall year.","Clearly, cash and derivatives were impacted by that volatility. PB hung in there. We did see deleveraging. It came down pretty dramatically in the fourth quarter. We've seen a little bit, probably a couple of points of gross balances coming back, but certainly not back to the levels of October. And again, the tone is more constructive here in the first couple of weeks, but the impacts around the equities was really around the cash and the derivatives.","James Gorman","Although I think he's also asking about, in the fixed income side, when we stood by our clients on the--","Jonathan Pruzan","Absolutely, sorry. Yes, so in FID, we clearly saw a much more difficult market. It was a one-way market. We stood to support our clients. It was tough client flow, and we really saw that both across -- really, in the macro space, the credit clearly impacted by the widening spreads. But we had good client activity and we supported our clients.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. You guys referred to this a couple of times, and James, I believe you referenced how you all made a change to the deferral schedule for comp a few years ago, which was also to bring in line with peers.","So, my question is what -- you made reference to the fact that it was the junior level, but what processes allowed the drift away from the competitive set over these past few years? And what steps are you putting in place so that we can all rest assured we're not going to see a three-peat of this event?","James Gorman","Yes. I think, Brennan, that's a fair question, but to be totally clear, I mean, the change we made several years ago was a big deal. I mean, that was a multibillion-dollar event. And that was -- I went to the Board and just said, we are pushing way too much compensation into future years. And we are mortgaging the future and I just don't think that's a good way to run a railroad.","You've -- yes, we want to defer comp because we want people to live with their actions when they're at this firm. And at the most senior levels, obviously myself, we defer most of it and we do that willingly. And -- but we didn't actually get the bottom end of the tables right if you looked at it. And we were at the outer ends for sort of the associate, VP, and junior ED levels and these are regarded sort of good housekeeping.","I have zero intention of a three-peat. There will not be a three-peat. We've done zero house -- we've done some housekeeping here. I think it was smart to do. And I wouldn't make a meal out of this. It's just something that given obviously the disappointing sort of sticker at a price numbers of some of this stuff; it affects things like the margin in Wealth Management because, as I said, $40 million, $45 million is a point of margin. If you change some of the comp and put it in this year and you do it all in one quarter, it affects that margin for that quarter. But I'm not -- I'm just not that -- I'm not that wound up about it, honestly. And certainly, there is -- to your core question, we are not going to be doing a three-peat on this. This was just a cleanup.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thank you. And then you guys commented on how we are -- the first quarter is off to a better start. Probably, we're going to see a lot more elasticity in revenues bouncing back in the Securities business. Curious if you can provide us some insights and share some perspectives on what you saw in Wealth. When you see several months of sequential declines in the markets that are particularly pronounced, there could be some shaking of confidence, which tends not to rebound as fast as markets might. Is that what we should also expect in Wealth? Might there be a little bit of a slower lift in that business? Or are you seeing some meaningful amount of the Wealth clients reengage or many of them that did not pull back in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","James Gorman","Yes, Brennan, good question. There are three or four things that can affect the Wealth business in difficult times of stress. One is advisers. Do they stay or leave? Attrition is extremely low, so that's not an issue. And I think, frankly, our adviser force, they like working at Morgan Stanley. The platform, the support, the brand, the stability of the firm, these are very positive. So, that's number one.","Number two, did clients pull assets out during the financial crisis? I think we lost 2.5% of our client assets during the financial crisis. So -- and that was, obviously, a very, very, very different world from what we've been in with a little market turmoil here. So, no, there's no issue there.","The third is, did clients move more money into cash? The answer to that is absolutely. You saw our deposit numbers go up. Our cash levels are -- I don't want to say at historic highs, but they're -- because I frankly don't have the full history, but as long as I've been doing this business, which is almost 30 years, these cash levels are high. And people that's sitting on the sidelines, they've had a lot of anxiety served up to them in the last year, not just consensus about the economy but political anxiety and all of the other stuff going on around the world. So, yes, high cash levels.","Do I expect clients to reengage if things stabilized? Absolutely. Part of reengaging is having products to buy, so new issue coming to market, the banking calendar being a positive. Clients see something that's attractive out there to participate in and they start getting moving, and the advisers are calling them.","So, I don't see -- again, I've been doing this a very long time and this is not a period where I would say you're seeing any fundamental shift in client attitude or confidence. You definitely have a very low level of transaction, which we've had for two years, and it's got increasingly lower and even pushed into more money being cash through the fourth quarter. That could stay as is. It can't go much lower just given where transaction revenues are, frankly.","I probably have a bias in 2019 that you'd see some rebound on that. I don't think you're going to -- we're not talking bull market rebound obviously, but I think you'd see some modest rebound in transaction activity. And as the calendar picks up, you also have the new issue starting to kick in.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Mike Mayo","Hi, can you hear me?","James Gorman","Yes, good morning Mike.","Jonathan Pruzan","Hey Mike.","Mike Mayo","I'm struggling with the quarter understanding exactly what happens, so I'm just going to kind of ask point blank. On the one hand, you can say, this is Morgan Stanley acting conservatively, scrubbing the balance sheet, housekeeping, new comp program.","On the other hand, it could be Morgan Stanley of old, where you had hiccups in Fixed Income like the second half of 2015 or 2013 or during the financial crisis. So, my question is, how much of this quarter, the fourth quarter -- I get you got your targets for the year, but I'm really talking about the fourth quarter. How much of this quarter is due to scrubbing the balance sheet and housekeeping and how much is due to execution falling short of what you wanted?","And what would be helpful there is -- so for the macro, fixed income the $500 million, that's half your target per quarter. How much of that was due to markdowns versus sales? And when it came to housekeeping, I guess were estimating $150 million impact due to the change in compensation. If you could give a specific number that was in response to Guy's question, too. Thanks.","James Gorman","Yes. Well, listen, I'll have a go at it, and I'm sure Jon will add in. And it's a good question, Mike. I don't really see it. I certainly don't see it as the B, which is the Morgan Stanley of old, if you will, the sort of episodic volatile shifts, overdependence on propositions, big marks, misplaced trades, major integrations going on at the same time, selling businesses, writing stuff off. It's not that. I mean that's -- we're not remotely close to that.","As to sort of housekeeping, cleaning up, balance sheet management, comp plan management, I wouldn't put all of it down to that either. I don't think that -- I think that flatters the numbers. That was a factor, as we went through, in a whole bunch of areas.","But on the business side, fixed income, $500 million is hardly a good quarter. That's not a satisfactory result from my perspective. We've talked about $1 billion a quarter, on average, and we've repeated on average because you can't guarantee it every time. We had I think $1.7 billion in the first quarter and $500 million and change in the last quarter, so that's $1.1 billion just on those two quarters. The year averaged at about $1 billion in a quarter, but yes -- no, that was not a good result. And we know that, the folks -- the team knows that and we don't -- we do not expect that to be standard operating procedure. So, on a pure operating basis, that was probably the biggest gap against our expectations.","And the third issue is obviously the market. I mean, clients move money into cash in times of distress, new issue gets pushed back, calendar gets pushed back. There's -- there are positions you have where you're supporting clients where you're taking small hits along the way. Some of your hedges don't work when all of the assets correlate and move together. I mean there was a lot of market activity.","So, I would put -- if you were to put probabilities against each of those three categories, I would put 0% against sort of the Morgan Stanley of old category. I would put 30%-plus, 30%, 40% on the sort of the various one-off things we did, cleanups and so on, and 60% of the results reflected what was going on in the market. And if you washed all of that out against the competitive set, I think you'd find our results probably look much more like the competitive set when you normalize that.","But again, I'm not -- we're not being defensive about it. It wasn't the quarter we wanted. And we move on to 2019 and we expect, as we said, a rebound in important areas. Jon, I don't know if you want to add to it.","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. I would just say on the -- to echo James on the point of the Morgan Stanley of old reference. If you think about -- and I was looking at this the other day. A quarter where we put up this type of result in fixed income was third quarter of 2015, and in that quarter, we were sub 4% ROE, sub $1 billion in PBT in Wealth.","So, the business is on much stronger footing, where that business is smaller today than it was and the relative contribution is not as important. It's an important business for us. We have confidence in it. As we said, we put up $5 billion of revenue in each of the last three years in a shrinking market, so it's not the business of old.","James Gorman","And I mean, we still -- I mean, just to say it. I think the net for the quarter is $1 billion, $1.5 billion, a little under that, I think, roughly. In the bad old days, Mike, even absent markets and stuff, we were happy to hit $1 billion net in our best quarters. And the bad old days were like four years ago, three. It wasn't -- this is a -- I have similar hair as I have back -- have now back then. So, it was -- we're not talking the real old days. So, yes -- no, I'm not. This is not that.","Mike Mayo","Just one follow-up. How much of the FICC underperformance was due to write-downs? And I asked because maybe you get write-ups if spreads are tightening here.","Jonathan Pruzan","No, I mean, there was no -- there wasn't any major individual event. As I said, we had good client activity, part of facilitating our market-making businesses standing in between flow. And that flow was tough this quarter.","So, there wasn't any individual event, Mike. Obviously, we do have inventories and inventories move up and down as markets move up and down. So, you'll see some of that in the first quarter.","James Gorman","We did have a write-down of a piece we own in the asset management business. We're not going to name it, obviously. But we've had some investments that were done pre-crisis, long, long time ago. And unfortunately, we continue to live with those. And they're not frankly that significant, but we -- that was something that went on this quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steven Chubak","Hey good morning. So wanted to kick things off with a question on the Wealth Management margin guidance. Certainly encouraging to hear the reaffirmation of the 26% to 28% target. I'm just wondering, given the benefit from the roll-off of the legacy Smith Barney contracts, I believe you guided to 125 to 150 basis points from that alone, whether that benefit -- should we expect it to fall to the bottom-line or will those proceeds be reinvested in the business?","James Gorman","Just -- again, I think it's important to note, and I'm sure your models do this. There's seasonality in that business. So, again, that's a full year number. I've no idea what the first quarter is going to look like, but we typically have FICO, the social security payments in the first quarter, some of that stuff. So, it's the full year number.","I think we're -- you're pointing it out right. I think we just had -- a couple of days ago, somebody sent me a note it was the 10th anniversary of the announcement of the deal, which was pretty exciting. It was January like 9th or 12th or something. And I think those deals, yes, they run off towards the end of this month, something like that.","So, we'll see some of that has been reinvested and will be reinvested in the business, but yes, you'll get some -- you clearly get some margin improvement from that -- against that. We -- just to say, at least for this quarter, obviously, where assets were priced on the equity side for the quarter was lower than they were in the previous couple of quarters. And the equity markets are recovering a bit then, so we'll be doing repricing at the end of this quarter.","So, they'll -- I would say there will continue to be some pluses and minuses through the first quarter and then things probably stabilize out a little bit more.","Steven Chubak","And the full year number is--?","Jonathan Pruzan","And the full year number is -- yes, we're solid on the full year number.","Steven Chubak","Got it. And just one follow-up on some of the comments relating to how clients are managing some of their cash given the sell-off in 4Q. You alluded to the elevated client cash levels. I could certainly see that in the data, James. You're clearly a good student of this business. But just given the market pullback at year end and the 7% uptick in deposits, I'm just trying to gauge how sticky is that cash, in your mind. Especially as equity markets grind higher, do you expect to see some immediate engagement? And how does that inform your NII guidance for the full year?","Jonathan Pruzan","So, you're right, we did see a nice uplift in the deposits. Some of that is seasonal, but clearly, some of that was activity driven by asset allocation, as we've talked about before. That's sort of the primary driver of what people do with their money in our system and we did see people change their behavior a bit here, either we saw redemptions in mutual funds going into cash and cash-like products as well as some of the dividends that they received not going back into the market. So, we did see a little bit more of the deposits than we had expected.","To the degree that those deposits stay in the system for longer, you're right; they'll have a positive impact on NII. Either way, I think we're very comfortable with our guidance that the NII will grow in line with our loan growth guidance, which is mid-single-digits. And I think it's a little too early to say how people are going to spend that money. We do typically see -- start to see some of that money flow out for taxes and other purposes. But again, it's a little early in the year to predict whether that stays -- that extra deposit stay on, but it would have a positive impact.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Christian Bolu","Good morning. Wanted to spend a bit of time on your Wealth Management technology investments. I agree that you got to do some pretty interesting stuff, especially around the Aladdin integration, et cetera. But help me understand how it translates into improved financial performance. Is it that you think it will be hard for peers to replicate so you can build a sustainable advantage over time? Or should I think about it some other way?","Jonathan Pruzan","I think there's a couple of ways to think about it on both revenue and expenses and also time. A couple of things that will be helpful, I think. Again, some of the digital tools go around asset aggregation and risk analytics. So that should -- over time, as adoption accelerates and FAs are using the product with their clients, should help with the external assets held away. So, from a medium to longer term, that should help us acquire more of our clients' assets, and we know they have a significant portion of those assets held away.","That will also help them just with the analytics and our Next Best Action and things that we have in that area should help them with their time. We find that when the adviser has more time, they have more ability to engage with their clients, which is always a positive. And then on the expense side, some of the changes that we're making eliminate some of the paper that goes on in the offices and whatnot and we'll continue to see efficiencies on the expense side because of these investments.","James Gorman","We're getting close to the end of the hour. We'll extend this for a little bit, I think, just to give everybody a chance to ask more questions because, obviously, there's a bunch of stuff people are trying to understand. So, why don't we go up to 9:15?","Christian Bolu","Okay. I've got one quickly. On the Stock Plan business, I believe Naureen Hassan talked about growing the business like 18 months ago. So, maybe help us understand the progress since then, what you've been doing differently or more in 2019 and beyond to drive further growth.","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. So, we've made some really critical hires in that business. We continue to transfer our plans on to another technology provider, and that process is going. It just kicked off this year. And we would expect that with the new focus and the new technology, we should be able to effectively touch more of those clients that we have in that space. And again, we think it's a real nice opportunity over the medium to longer term to bring in more clients and more assets into the business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about, kind of broadly speaking, expense flexibility if macro turns down again. And then, I guess, specifically within the Institutional Securities, you've had really nice market share gain in the investment bank as well as across the trading businesses the past couple of years.","And should we think about that as providing more flexibility to cut costs if you need? Or are you really mindful about protecting those share gains and less flexibility to cut costs than maybe we'd suggest?","James Gorman","Why don't I start on this and let Jon talk about how to think about the Institutional Business and expense management versus growth. Firstly, very important that we've reiterated our efficiency ratio, which was a 2018-2019 target. We say we'd be at or below 73%. I think we've had -- I don't know how many years we've put efficiency ratios in these decks, but certainly every other one, if not more often, and I don't think we've missed one yet. And last year, we're at 72%.","So, again, that's something -- we focus and we care a lot about expense management. Obviously, when you have a quarter with -- the way we had in the last quarter and some things going on, you -- if we thought that was a 12-month event, then we'd have a very different view on the expenses of this organization. But you don't want to panic. You don't want to have -- just because you have a quarter and suddenly you start throwing out a whole bunch of investments that are important for the growth of this firm. I mean, we got to focus on more than just a quarter. We've got a focus on three to five-year growth, and we plant a lot of seeds. We'd like to see them come through.","Now, all of you know a big part of our expense is compensation. I can absolutely promise you, if we have a year of flat to 2018 on revenues, our compensation will be down. We paid people well for a record year this year. We -- they deserve that. They've done a phenomenal job.","But the other side of that is we've got to find continued growth. And if we don't see that, then, obviously, we find that in the expense line. So, comp is a huge part of the expense line. And across this organization, I mean, we're in, I don't know, how many countries in the world. We make thousands of incremental business decisions that drive expenses every day, and yes, that is something we will be hyper focused on as we get through about the first half of this quarter and get a better sense of where we think things are really heading.","But we have an efficiency ratio out there for a reason, and we would do everything reasonably within our power to drive to that. Jon, do you want to talk about the investment within -- I mean, we've attracted talent so--","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. No, again, I think that you mentioned it. We have been gaining market share, but we do have flexibility and levers. We implemented the Streamline program a couple of years ago. That discipline has continued throughout the building. We have monthly meetings with all the business heads and all the units. People have targets and we're going to continue to be very focused on the expenses that we can control. And so there are levers, and if we need to use them, we will.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Devin Ryan","Thanks for that. Good morning. I guess first question here just on Brexit and the uncertainty that's been increasing over there and just how we should think about either risks to Morgan Stanley around potentially personnel movements or maybe indirect, just related to kind of how you guys are thinking about the outlook for the institutional business given that uncertainty is pretty high right now.","James Gorman","In terms of specific uncertainty to Morgan Stanley in personnel, I wouldn't -- if I were you, honestly, I wouldn't think about it. It's just -- that's not in my top 200 issues today. In terms of the potential for Brexit and the ongoing saga in the U.K. Parliament to disrupt the markets, to slow down one of the most important economies in the world, the U.K., potentially contribute to a further slowdown in Europe, that's getting in the top, I don't know, 15 to 20 issues that I deal with.","So, yes, we watch it very carefully, but we're a very global firm with resources all over the planet. So, we will manage this. And I think our team has done a great job setting up for both the expected Brexit outcome, which is a sort of soft departure or smooth landing or whatever the language is. But if it doesn't happen and we end up with a hard or we end up with no Brexit or remain, well, we're ready to deal with that, too.","Devin Ryan","Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up here just on Investment Banking. It was a light quarter for debt capital markets. I know issuance in the market was slow. But are you changing your thinking at all on extending balance sheet just with some of the volatility that we've seen recently?","And then with that volatility, as we're entering 2019, it will be great to get a little bit of perspective around the dialogue with clients, either on the equity issuance side, where I think there's been some enthusiasm around potential for IPOs this year and then also on the M&A advisory side as well.","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. I'll try to take that. In DCM, you're right; it was a tough finish in terms of volumes in the year, subdued activity levels. I think it was the slowest quarter since 2011. And from a high-yield perspective, it was the lowest since, I think, 2009. So, the volatility really shut down that market in the fourth quarter. As spreads widened out a bit, some deals got hung, Europe was really challenged. But we have seen that sort of reverse itself, as I think I mentioned. The high yield spreads have come in 100 basis points. Leveraged loans are back to where they were. There was a handful of deals on the road, mostly LBOs that are going well and that market seems to be reopening. And so we would expect a continuation of issuance there.","On the M&A side, and I've mentioned the pipelines and the backlogs, dialogues are good, confidence is high, people are looking for growth, and we have good dialogues going on now. You saw some of the announcements we made earlier in the year and we continue to be involved in those discussions. And we feel good about the pipeline.","And then lastly, on the equity product, the one caveat here is the IPO product in the U.S. as we need the SEC open to price those deals. We have a very strong pipeline and hopefully, this issue gets resolved. Then we'll bring those to market as soon as they do.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. Jon, maybe just first question for you. Just in terms of the environment, you mentioned getting better in the first quarter. Since some of the volatile like line items -- when I think about the Institutional Business, like the other line that credit flows through, investment line that was negative and then even the deferred comp, was there anything in the fourth quarter that was more like realized losses versus mark to market that if the market continues to stabilize, we would expect some normalization there?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, I mean -- again, as you know, most of that inventory is mark-to-market. And so as markets move up and down, we adjust those valuations. We have hedging that goes on that helps protect us from those volatilities.","But as I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw some things that we haven't seen in the past or we haven't -- some historical relationships broke down. There was one item that we'd call out in the press release and the other line around that investment we had in the public security. We still own that. It's restricted and so things will move around a little bit.","But if you step back even further for the full year, if you put all those lines together, 2017 versus 2018; they were pretty much -- pretty -- I think the Delta was a little under $200 million. So, it wasn't really material, again, through the overall year. It does have sometimes outsized impact to the quarter though.","Michael Carrier","Okay, that's helpful. And then, James, you mentioned just on the strategic review M&A a few times. You hit on it in the investment management business. I think you mentioned even in the Wealth and just wanted to get their sense. So, that you're seeing more, like innovative opportunities out there for acquisitions or is it you also some of the capital has been tied up and you haven't been able to maybe pay out as much as you want to? Just wanted to get a sense on what's sort of driving more of the M&A comments throughout the different businesses?","James Gorman","Yes. No, it's a good pickup and it's less the capital issue, frankly. And it's more a state of mind here. I don't want to suggest that the markets open up or not open up. That's very sort of deal and company-specific, but it's more our attitude. Our attitude is we have some terrific platforms. We are interested in finding ways to penetrate new client groups. And we just want to continue to build-out and obviously, doing deals in wealth and asset management is a completely different ball of wax than doing them in trading businesses or in banking businesses.","So, the bias is obviously, things that are sort of the scale-driven, within our wheel house and extend us into better penetration of existing clients or new clients. And we think we have capacity. Yes -- no, we're -- it's a focus. Obviously, getting deals done, as you all know, that's you know -- you can't guarantee stuff, but -- if you -- I know one thing, if you're not intending to do them, you won't do them.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Jim Mitchell","Hey good morning. May be a quick question on capital return. In November, Randy Quarles talked about maybe eliminating the leverage ratio in this post stress scenario. How do you -- does that change the way to think about capital return at all? Or any update on that front in terms of kind of discussions with the Fed on what the formal approach might be with respect to leverage and the stress tests?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. Unfortunately, there hasn't been a lot of progress. We do know the SCB is going to be delayed and therefore, I think those comments probably tie into the SCB and how he thinks about the capital regime going forward.","Obviously, 2019 stress test, I don't think will be impacted by some of the comments that he made in May. We haven't gotten the instructions at the scenario yet for the year, but we stand by the comment that we believe we have sufficient capital and should be able to return 100% of it going forward -- of the earnings, excuse me, not the capital.","Jim Mitchell","Thanks. And a follow-up to on liquidity reserve, I noticed that it did jump quite a bit. Just by balance sheet coming down. Is that sort of mechanical because of the environment? Or is there something else to read into the liquidity reserve jumping so much?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, I mean, there's two components one of the primary drivers is really deposits we talked about. We saw about an $8 billion increase in those suite deposits in the quarter. And then the second is, as client balances came down, we, obviously, have liquidity to support those businesses, the businesses use less of it.","We still hold that liquidity because our expectation is that the businesses will use it again and we -- as we've talked about a lot, we've dramatically changed the structure of our liabilities and the durability of our liabilities and therefore, we're sized to support our clients, to use less cash in the quarter and we still have it in case they want to use it again next quarter or this quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning gentlemen.","James Gorman","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys give us some color? You touched a little bit on the leverage loan market. Can you give us some color on your exposure to leverage loans and the CLOs? And just what you're seeing in that market may be compared to prior time periods where you guys are involved in that business?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. Two separate questions. On the event, there's some disclosure, I think in the footnotes that gets you to sort of a single -- or excuse me, non-investment-grade exposure. It's been pretty stable over the last period of time. So, I think going into the quarter, we felt very good with the book that we had or the exposures we had. They were well priced, structured.","We weren\u2019t involved in the deals that got pulled in the December timeframe. And we feel very good about sort of that book of business and being able to bring that to market, assuming these conditions continue to hold.","On the CLO front -- as you know we're an active securitizer. We provide warehouse for that business. We like that business. That business is dramatically different and I think, sometimes confused with the business of CDOs and other things years ago.","For us, the warehouse business, we've got good equity protection. Usually, somewhere in the order of 20%. The collateral is well diversified by sector; it's not all real estate, which it was back in the day. And so we like that business. We didn't see any credit -- any credit negative in that business this quarter. We're actually in the market with the CLO currently, hope to price it next week. A couple of deals might price next week so that business or that market is coming back as well. So, we like that business and it was -- it's a good business for us.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And just a quick follow-up, Jon. We've talked about this in the past. Obviously, you've had a good institutional penetration in equities. Can you give us an update on MiFID II? How you're seeing that play out? What benefits you're seeing for your business?","Jonathan Pruzan","A couple of things. I would say it's sort of consistent with the comments we talked about in the past. It probably outperformed our expectations a little bit although again our expectations was it wasn't going to have a material impact on the business.","We've outperformed a little bit. We have seen some consolidation of -- or how people look at their counter parties and consolidating. We've also seen some consolidation in the space as they are less providers. So, not material, but probably outperforming what we originally thought and also still pretty early and we'll have to see longer there on how impacts.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Your line is open.","Alevizos Alevizakos","Hi, thank you for taking my question. It's a question on the strategy update that you gave. Mostly interested about the -- your kind of confidence that you will be able to grow the lending, especially on mortgage business, because you're practically going against your peers, that they are closer to this kind of market segment. So, I was just wondering what makes you that comfortable with the 5% loan growth.","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, we, obviously, have multiple products, mortgage being one, the securities-based lending and tailored lending within the wealth segment and we continue to see good client engagement. The reason we are confident is that the last couple of quarters, as we've integrated -- our excuse me, shifted from the old platform we have that a new platform, we seen that -- those balances grow.","Again, the number of applications we have, obviously, rates came down a little bit. So, refinance activity has been a little bit healthier and we just feel that we're underpenetrated with our client base. Our clients like most products and we would expect to continue to grow them going forward.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today.

","Kathleen McCabe","Good morning. This is Kathleen McCabe, Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.","The presentation may also include certain non-GAAP financial measures.

This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument.","I'll now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Office James Gorman.","James Gorman ","Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Kathleen. As we begin another year, I'd like to share my thoughts on the current state of Morgan Stanley, discuss our progress against last year's priorities and share our plans for 2015. During my comments, I'll be referencing a presentation that you can find on the Investor Relations section of our website.","For the past five years this management team has worked hard to the following. One, to put the trouble for the financial crisis clearly in the rear review mirror. Two, to reposition our firm to benefit from our world class and complimentary franchises in Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management as shown on slide 3. And finally to lay out specific plans with clear signposts for investors to follow as we work towards sustained, higher returns. Each year we like to remind you of the key elements of the plan, mark those elements to market and refresh the plan for the coming year so investors can properly judge our absolute and relative performance. ","Before I make my strategic comments, let me briefly touch on the quarter. Our final result this year reflect a number of idiosyncratic issues including tax benefits, compensation changes, FBA implementation and legal reserves. In addition, the quarter reflects a difficult market in trading environment across the industry especially in October and the last few weeks of December. Our trading businesses in particular fixed income and commodity sales and trading were clearly not immune to the unfavorable market environment. While Q4 had several complicating elements, it was also an important quarter as we continue to put residual issues from the financial crisis behind us. In a few minutes, Ruth will take you through the quarter in much more detail.","Before doing so, let me begin with the mark-to-market for 2014 which you can now see on slide 4. 2014 was a year focused execution against the strategic plan we have previously articulated. In Wealth Management, we continue to improve our profit margin and are well on the way to delivering 22% to 25% margin by the end of 2015. Fixed income and commodities, we continue to resize and reshape the business and doing more to drive ROE. We continue to improve our expense ratios. We made strong progress in Morgan Stanley -specific growth opportunities most notably growth in the banks. We increased our share buyback and for the first time in several years, we increased our dividend. As a result of these collective actions, we've made progress towards returns that meet and exceed our cost of capital. ","With that, let me turn to the six areas of strategic focus for 2015. First, Wealth Management which is on slide 6. For full year 2014, we delivered a 20% margin on wealth management, up 200 basis points versus 2013 and we have a clear path for achieving our goal of 22% to 25% by the end of this year. After taking into account the adjustment to our compensation deferral, the pretax margin improved through the year. Our fourth quarter 2015 target is driven by the revenue and operating leverage from deposit deployment and the ongoing benefits of scale. It is important to note that this target does not take into account the benefit of eventual higher interest rates and stronger equity market levels. The target also does not include the benefit of the positive secular trend towards fee based managed account. This trend plays to the strength of our advisory based model and generally translates into more stable revenues and deeper client relationships, a trend we've discussed with you in the past. ","There are several additional drivers of upside for wealth management as we've outlined on slide 7. We continue to grow our assets under management and ended the year with over $2 trillion of client asset benefiting in particular from our focus on the high net worth and ultra-high net worth client segments. Since 2009, we've grown assets in the $10 million and above household by 82%, and assets in the $1 million to $10 million segment by 35%. Our model based on providing high valued advice, helps position us to meet the broad and complex financial planning and investment needs of these clients. ","We have further upside as we attract more of our clients' deposit that go consistent with our growing bank presence. Given the magnitude of the client base, even a modest increase in our share of client deposits hold significant upside for us. Greg Fleming will share more of this opportunity with you later this year.","Second is our bank strategy. On page 8, we described to you the components of revenue growth in our banks. We continue to benefit from the three tailwinds; one, growth in the deposit base and associated assets. Two, the optimization of those assets namely moving cash into [AFS] [ph] and lending, and three eventual upside from higher rates. We see strong loan demand among our sizable wealth management and institutional securities client base. With no bricks-and-mortar and embedded client base and a required infrastructure investment behind us, the incremental margin on lending product is exceptionally high. As a result of our ongoing progress in the bank, we are providing you with updated targets for 2015 as well as growth to $180 billion in assets by year-end 2016, up from $151 billion as of year-end 2014. ","Based on current market rates and our expected asset mix at the end of 2016, the blended yield would be 2%. If we substitute the yield indicated by the forward curve on the same asset base, the blended yield would be 3.1%. ","Turn now please to Slide 9. In our Institutional Securities business, our leadership in advisory and equity sales and trading continues to provide further stability along with upside. In advisory, we finished second in global completed and announced M&A. We've continued strength in large cap cross border M&A activity, we believe our global footprint and leadership across products and geographies, positions us well to benefit from current trends. In equity sales and trading, we build on the momentum of recent years. With full year revenues of $6.9 billion ex-DVA placing us first among US peers and we expect first globally. Our success in 2014 reflects high quality execution and share gains.","This brings us to our third area of strategic focus, Fixed Income and Commodities as seen on slide 10. Against the challenging backdrop, we made some progress on our plan to drive for return exceeding our cost of equity. Within fixed income, we reduced balance sheet, risk weighted assets and non-compensation expenses. We also maintained normalized ROEs of greater than 10% in our areas of strength namely securitized products and credit corporates. Furthermore, we continued to optimize returns in rates and roll down structured credit RWAs. Within commodities, we reduced our exposure to physical oil, most notably by selling TransMontaigne and we remained committed to selling our oil merchanting business. We are also integrating the balance of our commodities business within sales and trading. ","From a capital perspective, we remain on track to reduce fixed income and commodities RWAs to $180 billion target by yearend 2015, down from $390 billion in 2011. Furthermore, as you can see on slide 11, we will have an additional $25 billion of dead weight risk weighted assets that will roll down by the end of 2018 providing incremental ROE upside.","Assuming we find the right opportunities, we will utilize the associated capital to maximize return across the franchise either within fixed income or in other areas where client demand is consistent with the highest return opportunities.","Number four. Next area where we see upside is the benefit from lower funding costs shown in some detail on slide 12. As the market is recognized improvements our business makes and balance sheet, our spreads have contracted dramatically. More so than those of our peers. This reduces our funding costs, as we finance older more expensive debt. This should result in meaningful reduction in our weighted average cost of unsecured funding on both an absolute and relative basis over the next several years providing us with a further tailwind. ","Last year we issued new debt and an average spread of 100 basis points over three months LIBOR and improvement of 200 basis points since 2012. From peak to trough our average funding cost is expected to decline by approximately 25%. Fifth is our ongoing focus on expenses as shown on slide 13. The changes to the compensation structure announced in the fourth quarter reduced the overhang of prior year deferrals and decrease the portion of current new compensation deferred into future years which was the prudent thing to do. The result is a reduced liability in a muted environment and greater operating leverage in an improved revenue environment. ","With these changes, we've decreased our target compensation net revenue ratio in our institutional securities business to 39% or less in 2015 and beyond. Notably, this guidance assumes a flat revenue environment. In a better revenue environment, the compensation ratio could go even lower. In addition, we reaffirmed that we are working towards the compensation ratio of 55% or lower in wealth management and 40% or lower in investment management. ","We also remain focused on non-compensation expenses and achieved a 29% non-compensation efficiency ratio in 2014 excluding obviously the elevated legal expenses versus 2012 levels. With the changes to our compensation structure and our disciplined on non-compensation expenses, we remained on track to deliver an overall expense ratio excluding elevated legal of 79% or lower in 2015. ","Six is the return of capital to our shareholders. We've repeatedly emphasized our commitment to prudently increase our capital returns over time subject to regulatory approval. Our plan is to increase both our share buyback program and our dividend with greater returns of capital supported by the increased proportion of our revenue and earnings coming from more stable businesses. As you can see on slide 14, since 2012 we've grown our total payout ratio from 13% to 30%. While also investing in our business through the completion of the wealth management JV. Critically, during that same period we've grown our capital base by 12%.","The key drivers of increased return to shareholders over time our consistent earnings, a strong capital ratios and a strategy that is consistent with evolving regulatory requirements. ","Finally, let me address returns. Our focus remains on generating high returns for shareholders by improving our ROE to sustainable level that exceed our cost of equity independent of market conditions. We see a clear path to an ROE of 10% based on the levels we've just described you, all of which are within our control. ","To summarize, this includes achieving our wealth management margin target, executing on our bank strategy, completing our exit from a physical oil business, progress on our optimization and fixed income, continued focus on disciplined expense management and continued CCAR capital approval. We also see higher than 10% returns with an improved rate environment, improved global economic growth which in turn drives our wealth management and institutional securities business performance. And higher payout ratios reflecting higher capital returns. ","Now that we finished the broader, strategic discussion, let me return to Ruth who walk through the details of the fourth quarter performance and way we finished 2014.","Ruth Porat","Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures. Results for the fourth quarter include several significant items which complicate comparisons to prior period. They include a net discrete tax benefit of $1.4 billion or $0.77 per diluted share principally related to the restructuring of a legal entity. Compensation expense adjustments of approximately $1.1 billion or $0.40 per diluted share related to changes in discretionary incentive compensation deferrals. A pretax charge of $468 million reflected as negative revenue or a loss of $0.17 per diluted share related to the initial incorporation of funding valuation adjustments, FVA into the fair value measurements for certain over-the-counter derivatives and legal expenses of $284 million or a loss of $0.12 per diluted share associated with several legacy residential mortgage related matters. In addition, the impact of DVA in the quarter was positive $223 million with $161 million in fixed income sales and trading and $62 million in equity sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, reflecting the impact of $468 million related to FVA, firm-wide revenues were $7.5 billion, down 13% versus the third quarter. And earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders excluding DVA were $783 million. Earnings from continuing operation per diluted share excluding DVA were $0.40 after preferred dividend. Earnings from continuing operation include the impact of the previously mentioned funding valuation adjustment, net discrete tax benefit, and compensation expense deferral adjustment and legacy residential mortgage related matters in the quarter. On a GAAP basis including the impact of DVA firm-wide revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $928 million. Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.47 after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was $34.62 per share and tangible book value was $29.63 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $808 billion at December 31, down from $815 billion at the end of the third quarter. Deposits as of quarter end were $134 billion, up $9 billion versus Q3, reflecting the on boarding of deposits from city and typical seasonal increases in client cash. Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $193 billion compared with $190 billion at the end of the third quarter. ","Turning to capital, although our calculations are not final, we believe that our common equity Tier-1 transitional ratio will be approximately 14.2% and our Tier-1 capital ratio under this regime will be approximately 15.9%.","Basel III transitional risk-weighted assets are expected to be approximately $423 billion at December 31. Reflecting our best estimate of the final set of reserve rules our pro forma common equity Tier-1 ratio using the Basel III fully-phased in advanced approach was 12.4% at December 31, down from 12.7% in the third quarter.","Our pro forma standardized ratio was 11.7%, flat to the third quarter. Pro forma fully-phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $432 billion. We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the U.S. final rule to be approximately 5% at December 31, up from 4.9% at the end of 3Q, 2014. These estimates are preliminary and are subject to revision.","Turning to expenses. Our total expenses this quarter were $7.9 billion, up versus the third quarter reflecting the significant items I noted at the outset. Compensation expense was $5.1 billion in the quarter driven primarily by the change in compensation structure. Specifically the quarter include an expense of $1.1 billion representing $756 million related to the reduction in the average deferral of discretionary incentive compensation award for the 2014 performance year and $381 million for the acceleration of investing for certain outstanding deferred cash based incentive compensation award. This provides us with operating leverage in the upside and reduces liability in the down side as best evidenced by the reduced compensation ratio target for 2015 and beyond the James noted. ","Non-compensation expense was $2.8billion for the quarter, up 13% quarter-over-quarter driven by increase legal expense. Let me now discuss our businesses in detail.","In institutional securities revenues, excluding DVA, were $3.2 billion, down 25% sequentially and include a pretax charge of $468 million related to the initial incorporation of funding valuation adjustment. Revenues excluding the impact of FVA and DVA were $3.7 billion, down 15% sequentially. ","Non-interest expense was $4.3 billion, up versus the third quarter. Compensation expense was $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter, up 37% versus the third quarter driven by the previously mentioned compensation expense deferral adjustment. ","Non-compensation expense for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion, up 23% versus the third quarter driven by increased legal expenses. Including the impact of DVA and FVA, revenues were $3.4 billion.","In investment banking revenues of $1.3 billion were down 3% versus last quarter. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked number 1 in global IPOs and number 2 in global announced and completed M&A and global equity at the end of the fourth quarter. Notable transactions included in advisory, Morgan Stanley continued its leadership position in cross border and large transaction including as lead financial advisor to Cubist Pharmaceutical and its announced $9.5 billion sales to Merck. ","In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley a sole book runner completed a $4.7 billion H - share follow on offering on behalf of China based insurer, Ping An Insurance Group. ","In debt underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as Lead Left book runner on Alibaba's $8 billion inaugural senior notes offering. This was landmark deal, the third largest debt IPO globally and largest bond transaction for an Asian issuer ever. ","Advisory revenues of $488 million increased 24% versus our third quarter results driven by increased revenues in EMEA and the Americas.","Underwriting revenues of $807 million decreased 15% versus our third quarter results driven by equity underwriting revenues of $345 million, down 26% versus the third quarter, reflecting lower volumes in Asia and the Americas.","Fixed income underwriting revenues of $462 million, down 5% versus the third quarter primarily due to decrease in investment grade loans, partly offset by increased issuance in both investment grade and high yield bond. Equity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA were over $1.6 billion, down 9% compared to last quarter. Cash equity and derivative revenues were down sequentially due to more challenging market environment. Revenues in prime brokerage were flat versus the third quarter.","Fixed income and commodity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA were $133 million, down significantly versus the third quarter, primarily reflecting a pretax charge of $466 million related to the initial incorporation of FVA into the fair value measurement of certain over the counter derivative. Revenues excluding DVA and the pretax charge related to FVA were $599 million for the quarter. Commodities revenues were challenged in the quarter due primarily to the decline in oil prices. Credit revenues in the quarter were down versus the third quarter driven by a difficult market environment. Average trading VaR for the fourth quarter was $47million, up from $42 million in the third quarter.","Turning to wealth management. Revenues were $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter, up 1% sequentially. Asset management revenues of $2.1 billion were flat to the last quarter. ","Transaction revenues were up 7% compared to last quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $573 million, up 14% to the prior quarter, driven by a pickup across most products. Investment banking related fees of $173 million, down 23% versus last quarter, primarily reflecting lower activity in closed end funds and trading revenues of $230 million, up 24% versus the third quarter, reflecting higher revenues from deferred compensation plans.","Net interest revenue increased 4% to $625 million, driven primarily by higher revenues from our bank deposit program and continued growth in our lending product. Other revenue of $67 million decreased 40% versus the third quarter primarily due to the absence of the gain on sale of a retail property space we discussed in the third quarter. Non-interest expense was $3.1 billion, up 3% versus last quarter. Non-compensation expense was $777 million, down from last quarter.","Compensation expense was $2.3 billion, up versus the third quarter, primarily due to the compensation expense adjustments related to changes in discretionary incentive compensation deferral previously mentioned. The compensation ratio was 60% up versus the third quarter, reflecting the change in compensation structure. ","The PBT margin was 19% which similarly reflects the impact of the change in compensation structure. ","Profit before tax was $736 million. Total client assets exceeded $2 trillion, global fee based asset inflows were $20.8 billion, fee-based assets under management increased to $785 billion at quarter end, representing 39% of client assets. Global representatives were 16,076, essentially flat to the third quarter. Deposits in our bank deposit program were $137 billion, up $8 billion versus the third quarter. Approximately $128 billion were held in Morgan Stanley Bank.","Wealth Management lending balances continued to grow reflecting the ongoing execution of our bank strategy. Investment Management revenues of $588 million were down 12% sequentially. In traditional asset management revenues of $432 million were down 8% versus the third quarter, driven in part by lower market level.","In real estate investing, revenues of $103 million were down compared with the third quarter. Merchant banking revenues were $53 million down 38% driven by the absence of investment gains versus the third quarter. Non-interest expenses were $594 million, up 25% from the third quarter including compensation expense of $381 million reflecting a compensation deferral adjustment mentioned previously. ","Non-compensation expense was $213 million, down 4% from the third quarter. Profit before tax was loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter. NCI was $12 million versus $18 million last quarter. And total assets under management increased to $403 million driven by higher flows, primarily offset by market depreciation.","Finally, our outlook is consistent with data that suggest ongoing growth in the U.S. and the expectation the key market outside the U.S. will benefit from central bank support. Both should benefit client activity level particularly in the sales and trading businesses. In investment banking, the M&A pipeline is up, driven by continued strength in large and cross border M&A where we are well positioned given our global franchise. The global equity underwriting pipeline remains similarly healthy, benefiting from broad base global activity. The pipeline also includes traditional issuance from transaction that was deferred to the first half of 2015 during the market choppiness of October. ","In Wealth Management, which is overwhelmingly U.S. driven, our outlook is also positive. Our margin target indicates upside in the business and underscores confidence about the state of, and growing contribution from the execution of our bank strategy. As James noted, lower funding cost continue to provide upside in revenues for our sales and trading business. ","Regarding the regulatory environment. Through all the actions we've taken in the last five years, we are well positioned to deal with the requirement we face. With the strong capital and liquidity ratios we've built, we have great flexibility to deliver for clients and stakeholder.","Thank you for listening. James and I will now take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. ","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Quick question on the outlook and the strategic update which is much appreciated. The potential to take FIC RWAs to $155 billion based on the passive roll down, what sort of time line should we use to think about that?","Ruth Porat","So the target is as we indicated is $180 billion by yearend 2015. And that includes the additional $25 billion of run off over time. That additional $25 billion will run off through 2018. So that would take it to the $155 billion unless of course we find opportunities to reinvest within fixed income as James said. So that's over 2018.","Brennan Hawken","Got it. Thank you. If you guys find that FIC returns sort of remain at current levels, we kind of get this current environment proves to be a bit more of the steady state rather than what many of us are hoping is a cyclical weak point, how low can that number go beyond that if you find that you need to allocate more money over to the equities and the wealth management from a capital perspective?","Ruth Porat","Well, we have ample capital and so we are supporting the client demand and activity in the equities business and don't want to leave you with that the final comment you made which is to -- is it a trade off between the two. So again very importantly given the strong capital positions in and given the strength and importance of the equity business two or three of ample capital to support client activity there and are -- as it relates to fixed income, our approach has been as we've said repeatedly to be very clinical about capital balance sheet expenses and that was the main point that we made here this morning. We've reduced each of those in 2014 and we remain very focused on how to drive returns in the business. So being very diligent on that. ","Brennan Hawken","Okay, all right. Thanks for that. On FIC, there was a change leadership in the commodities business. Is that indicative of a new direction for that business? And then also as we think about the commodities business, is it possible that the overall business there has been impacted by the sort of drawn out sale process to the physical business? ","James Gorman ","Brennan, I think we put in place the commodity strategy couple of years ago which was completely independent of the regulatory environment we are in which was essentially we did not want to be a significant player in physical businesses. The largest physical space we had was in oil. And we completed the TransMontaigne deal and we are well underway to complete the rest of the sale when obviously ran into other issues requiring government approval. So we are still on that track. So the management changes were completely independent of that. These are big businesses. We management evolve and company of this size periodically. So I wouldn't read great deal into that. We are well on track with commodities. So with where we wanted to be. Did it affect the performance the business; the fact ran the sale process. I can't really say whether it did or didn't. Certainly, I wouldn't say materially, I think much more material was actually going on in the oil market in the last several months. We didn't have a good fourth quarter in commodities. It happens almost, probably almost volatile business segment. I don't expect that to be a permanent state. ","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Thanks for all that color. And then last on capital markets. You guys highlighted lower revenues in derivatives and cash. Was there anything episodic impacting those businesses? Because we heard some of the competitors highlight some strength in some of those businesses especially cash recently. ","Ruth Porat","No. I would say that overall our client franchise remains strong and so we are continuing to see levels of activity. Cash tends to be seasonal as you wind up the year. So, no, I wouldn't call out anything particular, choppier markets are more challenging for derivative. ","Brennan Hawken","Sure, sure, okay. That's helpful. And then deferred comp, I think you guys weighted out, I know that it can sometimes impact both the revenue and expense line in wealth management, changes in the deferred comp. Did we -- can you quantify that for us and did that impact the pretax margin in wealth management this quarter aside from the noise that was going in the change in deferrals? ","Ruth Porat","No. You just said it, the key point in the margin was really the change in this structure of compensation, usually PBT margin neutral and so, no, it didn't -- the main point was the change in structure. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. ","Glenn Schorr","Thanks. So you noted the legal on the quarter. I am curious if you had handy the all in legal cost for the year? And if it is right for us because I am thinking about lot less next year given that mortgage put to bed, LIBOR setting bank and obviously had limited FX business? ","Ruth Porat","So the full year a legal related expenses for 2014 were around $600 million. ","Glenn Schorr","And you think I am crazy if I am thinking for next year?","Ruth Porat","Well, the point we take consistently is it litigation from the crisis and resolved that remains headwind, I appreciate the question. It is tough to forecast neither timing or announces is fully in our control. So appreciate the question but that's about all I think.","Glenn Schorr","So I like to slide on the lower funding cost and I think lots of are benefiting, you are benefiting maybe little more than most, can you put that in a dollar term for us, in terms of what means for next year, the year after. I understand that it is fallen and it is pretty dynamic conversation. I am just curious if its dollar.","Ruth Porat","Well, we realized the benefit over time given the weighted average maturity of unsecured stack is about six years. So as we refinance out of that, well leg into at over time, at this point we are refinancing some of that we issue both crisis and that's why wanted to give the trajectory and overall the trend line. ","Glenn Schorr","All right. Two other clean up. So one the clean comp ratio for 2014 for ISG is a lot of ex all the FVA, DVA and comp charges? ","Ruth Porat","Right. So full year again excluding all of those is full year about a point. ","Glenn Schorr","Around to -- is it 40, 41?","Ruth Porat","Yes, full year 41 down from 42 after.","Glenn Schorr","Got it. Okay and then last one on deposit front. The fee based flows were huge for any quarter, fourth quarter; I don't remember being usually a big quarter for it. Usually think of that is more as beginning of the year if there was any seasonality to at all. The question is, has anything change on incentive wise or no product wise or is it just the continuation of the process? ","Ruth Porat","No. We had strong flows during the fourth quarter and the full year. There can be some lumpiness as we talked about last quarter but continued strength in it as you appropriately said it is kind of -- you look at a full year and it is very strong and underscores the point that James made which is that there is a strong secular trend here and we benefit from given the scale of the business we have and the breadth of products content and service we are providing. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Please go ahead with your question.","Guy Moszkowski","Good morning. Just trying to read into the ROE chart at the end of the strategic presentation. Last year the base line was 9%, this year the base line number you built of is 10%. Is it really just that the 10% base line now includes higher confidence on capital actions. Is that the main difference or should we be saying that there is material underline increase when all the puts and takes are taken into account? ","Ruth Porat","I am glad you pointed out because we do think it's important. There are number of items that are reflected in that. I would say the change in compensation structure is the contributor as well and so James laid out the various items. And as you know this is without the benefit from a rising rate environment. So it is what we see the upside wealth management and the bank is incorporating revenue benefit from the lower funding costs, we are continuing to make progress in fixed income. Although we are doing on the expense side as I said that compensation structure change is important and did allow us to reduce the comp ratio in ISG to 39% or lower, that's in flat revenue environment. So better revenues, we have even further operating leverage but that's an important point. And all the stuffs we've taken over the last several years. The expectations about continued increases and return to capital. So we've made some tough choices, appreciate a complicated some of the comments this morning but made these tough choices that did have a negative impact on the quarter but sets us up well and that's we put it in here as we are modeling a 10%.","James Gorman ","I would just add, Guy, what we've always try to do is when we have clarity of vision on something is too laid out there for our shareholders. And we have much more clarity of vision around the 10% frankly. As Ruth said because of all the things that we have checked off and some of the things we've put behind is in the change in the comp and where we have capital, much more clarity of vision. So when we see something that we think is clearly achievable that's what we are going to put out for shareholders and we have also identified that there is obviously upside. It is depended on something which are less within our control but not unreasonable to expect at some point in the future. ","Guy Moszkowski","And is that additional upside about the same as it was last year? Obviously all we have is hopefully proportional hunk of a bar chart to compare it against but it appears that's largely unchanged? ","James Gorman ","Yes. I wouldn't draw too much into our graphic skills and ratios of bar sizes. No, I think we are saying, we clearly see an improved rate environment. We are in a business mix that we think does well with the improving global economy and we are over-weighted to the U.S. because of wealth management which is we all know is doing best among the developed countries on risk adjusted return basis. And we clearly see additional capital returns because we are seeing all the capital ratios that we\u2019ve talked about. ","Guy Moszkowski","Got it. And just as a follow up on the capital ratios. Thank you, Ruth, for the fully phased figures on both advanced and standardized, why did the advanced come down a little bit? ","Ruth Porat","So as you know we are governed by standardized, as flat under standardized, and the RWAs under the advanced approaches were up for a couple of reasons, primarily due to volatility but also lending growth and ops risk goes in there. So those are up; it was really RWA is up.","Guy Moszkowski","Got it. On the oil business which as you pointed out ran into a roadblock because of the Russian situation in terms of trying of sell it, what's the outlook there and if it is not sold, would you look to wind that business down and over what timeframe? ","Ruth Porat ","So we do remain focused on selling it as a business and we'll let you know when we have something to say on that. ","James Gorman ","Yes, I mean we are clearly intent on getting out of the physical oil business. We made that very clear. We had a contract for sale. We couldn't complete for reasons outside of our control. And we will get out of the physical oil business. ","Guy Moszkowski","And I guess the question was really around if it's harder to sell in the current environment and you need to wind down elements of it, what kind of timeframe should we be thinking about? ","Ruth Porat","We actually don't see if the question is really with lower oil and that affect the sale of the business. We don't see it negatively affecting the sale. We have excess storage capacity so that actually sets the business up well to benefit from rising oil prices and we think capacity at these levels and benefiting as oil prices rise. So it doesn't affect the sale process. ","Guy Moszkowski","Okay. That's helpful color. On the FIC target just with run off down to the 155 and this is maybe a subtle change in what you are communicating but I want to make sure I understand it. I think you had said previously that as you got down to the 155 \u2013 160 level from the run off you would look to redeploy within FIC to the 180 level. But now it sounds like you are leaving the options open to redeploy more broadly across the business. Is that right? And if so, what drives the thinking? ","Ruth Porat","That is correct. And what we are saying is look there have been structural headwinds in the industry, there have been some cyclical ones as well. We have a clear plan that includes the reduction in balance sheet capital and expenses that we've talked about. And we just wanted -- we are being -- what we are saying is we're being very clinical here which is we are targeting 180, there is another 25 that comes off and the right prudent thing to do as custodians of the business is to ensure we put that incremental capital capacity to support the highest return businesses across highest return products and if that's within fixed income where we've already some products that are generating attractive return such as in corporate credit and securitized product. And there is client demand for incremental capital that's an opportunity but we will look across the franchise. So you are right. I am glad you drew that it out; it is change we just want to make it very clear how we are approaching it. ","Guy Moszkowski","Good, well, I think your shareholders probably appreciate that, that flexibility so that's good to understand. In terms of the reduction in the ISG comp target. Is all of that reduction to 39% or less due to the change in the deferral strategy or is there actually a view that in the current environment you can reduce the comp payout? ","Ruth Porat","It is due to the change in the comp structure. It was an important step for us to take; it gives us as I said reduced liability on the downside importantly operating leverage in the upside but by pulling forward future deferral and changing the deferral rate it enabled us to set that compensation ratio at 39% in a flat rate, flat revenue environment. It was operating leverage, a lower comp ratio and a better revenue environment and we think underscores importance of that change. ","Guy Moszkowski","Cool. And then just one final one for me on the legal cost this quarter. Was that essentially a litigation reserved build because of things for which you had estimable and probable or was it actually a clean-up of current quarter expenses? And, if so, can you give us a little color on what they were? ","Ruth Porat","Yes. Reserves as you just said are based and estimated each quarter based on FAS5 so probable and estimable. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question. ","Mike Mayo","Hi. I was looking for more color on slide 15 with the ROE target. And does this imply that going from 9% to 10% that if you have capital action so could be 11% and on tangible basis it could be 12%? Again I am just comparing this year slide 15 with last year's slide 15. And related to that you talked about having a greater clarity of vision but this also comes in a quarter where you missed consensus expectations. So is this quarter a one-off in your mind or how do you think about all that? ","James Gorman ","Firstly the 9% to 10% reflects all of the things that are implied under the -- or listed on the left hand side of that page, Mike. It also talks about as last of those receiving non objection on our CCAR capital request. And what we pointed out is that obviously in future, yes, we see future upside as we make additional capital returns as we are reshaping the balance sheet and reshaping the businesses. So it's -- when we talk about clarity of vision, we are one year closer. We are seeing real progress in the wealth management business with a margin improvement of 200 basis points. We expect progress to continue. This is why we set goals which are currently above where we are performing. We see real opportunity in the lower funding cost. It is clear that our bank strategy is being well executed in building the asset side of the balance sheet and we\u2019re continuing to see roll on of deposits et cetera, et cetera. So we felt it was important to lay out for our shareholders.","Mike Mayo","And the timeframe for this target?","James Gorman ","Obviously, we haven't given timeframe on these targets because we can't control the market environment around us. ","Mike Mayo","Okay. Well, some more specifics related to this. In terms of higher interest rate slide 6, you talk about the margin improvement and you said your 22% to 25% wealth management pretax margin does not rely on higher interest rate. Can you describe your interest rate sensitivity if rate did increase 100 or 50 basis points? ","Ruth Porat","So you are actually right, this does not include benefit of higher rate. You can somewhat say the benefit rate through the roll forward that we have on the bank side. We frequently discussed there are a real positive for us, the factors to consider in that as you are modeling it out is we do generate higher net interest income even in the flat rate environment because we are still in relatively early stages of deposit deployment. I think that's quite differentiated but rising rate environment just a component, again it does drop meaningfully to the bottom line because of the cost structure, the bank and James said, we've already invested in the infrastructure required. We don't have bricks and mortar; FAs are not paid on the grid. All the things that we've talked about with you before. And then what we did as we provided yields and assets mix to help you model the NII upside and we actually extended out the estimate of asset growth to 2016 on that slide. Previously we had out to 2015; it builds on the strength of the performance in 2014. In fact, we ended prior to our estimate for 2014. And I think the other couple of elements in it but just no update on that. So given deposit here are different from retail bank. They are very sticky given the nature of deposit and more like working capital. We continue to assume about our 45 basis point increase in deposit pricing with the first 100 basis point increase in rate. We do believe that model is conservative given the nature of our deposits and structural changes and deposit alternative. Those funds -- it continues to be more relevant rate for our business than the average ratio of bank asset is around year and half. So again rising rates benefit as quickly but the point on this on the bank side really was to extended out so that you can model in the benefit as you see-- as you escalate rising rate.","Mike Mayo","What is your efficiency ratio for the bank since you are talking about that your expense to revenue ratio? Because you highlighted the fact that you don't have bricks and mortars so I assume the efficiency ratio would be better than the typical bank?","Ruth Porat","Yes. We don't rate that out separately, but you are absolutely right which why we said it drops meaningfully to the bottom line. ","James Gorman ","Yes. I mean it's obviously better because the whole strategy around the bank is driving more throughputs through an existing branch structure. ","Mike Mayo","And then lastly you highlighted compensation so did I hear you correctly that the compensation expense should decline from 41% on a core basis in 2014 to 39% or less in 2015? Is that correct? ","Ruth Porat","Yes. Correct. In a flat revenue environment, yes.","Mike Mayo","And James you have been very vocal in the past and I guess in hindsight giving a lot of stock to people at much lower stock prices worked, but can you talk about the trade-off between paying your people and then meeting Wall Street expectation? In other words getting the desired earnings growth. There is talk about people from brokered firms going elsewhere such as private equity. So how do you manage that trade-off?","James Gorman ","Well, firstly, Mike, I am delighted for all of our shareholders if the stock is appreciated, 26% I think last year, 60 something percent years before and 25% year before that including our employees who frankly deserve that. They are the ones who rode the boat. They got the job done and they deserved it. So I have no qualms about the employees benefiting from the rising stock. And listen, it is a balance. What we did coming at the crisis was we deferred up to a 100% our employees' bonuses, we did that for a very specific reason and it is unnatural act of 100%. We've recognized that and we were working our way down over a period of years to 50% and we decide to bite the bullet and get it done in 2014 and bring ourselves back where we think the industry will settle which is at 50% deferrals. We are still high relatively to our competitors so certainly from a shareholder perspective it remains a very friendly concept. It continues to tie our employees into the firm which is what we want and what they want as evidenced by a low attrition. And, no, I am not concerned about the onesies and twosies who choose to go into different paths of the financial sector, we get very attractive employee base coming in this firm and as frankly it's just not an issue. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question. ","James Mitchell","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up quickly on the low-- the funding costs trajectory. I guess first is there any -- you highlight again 25% by 2016, is there -- is that presumption of the rate environment or is that pretty much locked in? Just how should we think about that net benefit? ","Ruth Porat","So the funding cost reduction reflects the forward curve so it builds in that -- those higher rate, so with kind of respect rate move we do swap our debt to floating because our assets are floating but it spills off the forward curve.","James Mitchell","Okay. So but any change in the forward curve would have an impact on that assumption, okay. ","Ruth Porat","Yes. ","James Mitchell","And then if we think about the funding cost target, if we just look at your interest expense from last year which I think was about $3.7 billion, that how we should think about the 25% reduction of that $3.7 billion? ","Ruth Porat","No. There are obviously number of components in that. So it is not quite straight forward as that. ","James Mitchell","So would be a little less than that? You are not going to help, okay. ","Ruth Porat","Yes, you do modeling. ","James Mitchell","And was there any meaningful CVA this quarter?","Ruth Porat","CVA was a bit of drag this quarter and last year and positive last quarter. So, yes, just a bit but -- just a bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Carrier","Thanks. First question just on the FIC outlook for RWA. Just want to see if you had any I guess lost revenues related to going from the $188 billion down to say $155 billion?","Ruth Porat","One of the points we've made over time is that these are -- we call them dead weight, it is really dead weight capital and that it is supporting assets that aren't generating revenue worth funding old positions and so they are negative ROE now. And they were loss, they go from negative ROE to neutral to zero and the objective is then to take that excess capital and put it behind client activity and areas that are most accretive to the overall franchise. But the most important point is they are negative ROE because -- it is really just the financing cost on these long dated positions. ","Michael Carrier","Okay. And then just on expenses for the legal the $284 million, , I just wanted to be clear because it seems like each quarter there are some legal cost, obviously at the firm. But is this just related to the residential mortgage in a matter or is that everything in the quarter? And if it wasn't, just what was your kind of your normal legal in the quarter? ","Ruth Porat","So what we call that was as we said related to the residential. ","Michael Carrier","Okay, got it. And then last one just in terms of the -- where your CG1 ratio is, just given we had the buffers out there, where do you expect to run the ratio in a longer term? And then based on the Basel and SFR, any update or any guidance in terms of how you guys stand? ","Ruth Porat","So in terms of the buffer on the various ratios sought, we are in a very strong position as we said, fully phased in standardized, 11.7, advanced 12.4, well above requirement even with estimates of what may occur with the incremental buffer and at this point given these are required over time not just are quantifying above or above that. But we got a --we are running substantially above the requirement which is again consistent with our view that we have capacity to continue to return capital. As it relates to the net stable funding ratio, we are above a 100% as currently proposed by Basel, obviously still awaiting the final US rules. And you probably heard me say too often that we firmly believe in the durability of funding is imperative and that's how we run the firm. One concern about the rule is that it actually isn't proper ALM, and certain transactions which create liquidity in practice or our consumers of liquidity under the NSFR construct. I think it's notable that this element, the rule has been left to national regulators to tailor in the final rules. But short answer to your question, we are in a strong position with NSFR as it stands and that's keeps us in a strong position to deliver for clients. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.","Steven Chubak","Hi, good morning. So, James, you noted in your discussion on FIC that in addition to shrinking RWAs, you also managed to shrink actual fixed balance sheet assets and when looking at the product level commentary or disclosure you provided, it does appear that businesses that are actually generating returns below their cost of equity are more concentrated in those areas like global rates where they are more balance sheet or leverage intensive than risk intensive. I just want to get an understanding as to how much more optimization potential we could see on the asset side of the equation that could help improve returns over the next couple of years? ","Ruth Porat","Well, let me take that couple of point. Year-on-year, we had a sizable decline in our balance sheet and that is at the same time that we were increasing deposits. We have this ongoing contractual on boarding of deposit supporting our lending business. So what that really reflects is optimization and trading businesses and that's primarily within fixed income. And so we are continuing advertise lends on balance sheet as we go into this year. There is some growth from deposits and we are very focused on making sure to the heart of your question that we are using every -- all assets, all resources where we can drive the strongest return and that's been part of the optimization on balance sheet to date. I think the other point is as I noted our SLR is at 5% and so we've been -- we are in a good spot, we said we will be there in 2015. We are here as we ended 2014. And again that gives us -- so we've got ample opportunity and what we are looking it as to how drive returns.","Steven Chubak","Thanks, Ruth. And then just one more question on ISG, actually switching over to the expense side. I appreciate the disclosure on the comp target for 2015 assuming a flat revenue environment. I was hoping if you can give some color as to what the non personnel ratio should look like ex legal going in 2015, also assuming that you have a flat revenue environment for the coming year. ","Ruth Porat","I don't have that with me.","Steven Chubak","Okay. And then just one quick final one on wealth management. Did appreciate the disclosure on the yield opportunity for the bank, but just giving your expectation as to how the funding your liability profile evolve, what the reasonable expectations for what the NIM trajectory should look like over the coming years, not just assuming a flat revenue environment but also contemplating the future yield opportunities that you highlighted on the asset side? ","Ruth Porat","So the reason we laid out as we did, if we wanted to give you the growth in the slide that James went through on the bank as we also broke up the split between deposits supporting growth and institutional securities versus wealth management, we are seeing growth in both and we laid out the yield. So that you can actually, you can model it out over time. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. ","Matt O'Connor","Good morning. I was just hoping the follow up on the timing of the 10% ROE target. You talk about relatively stable macro trends in terms of trading, investment banking. So it seems like it is more about execution and call it the passage of time specifically in FIC, so I guess as you think about the timing, is this 2015 target? Is this a five year target? Just trying to push a little bit on this.","Ruth Porat","Look, as James said we have given you the key drivers of it and not putting a date on it, but you see the key drivers of it and certain other steps that we took as we ended this year. Put a fine point on certain of the elements that will drive ROEs higher, for example the change in comp structure enabling us to take down the comp ratio and some of the other elements that we have delineated, so I will be repetitive I go through, we are no putting a date on it but you can see the actions we've taken put, it will give clarity about execution against them. ","James Gorman ","I can promise you one thing though. It is not a five year target. ","Matt O'Connor","Okay and then in terms of the capital against it, obviously you've got probably more than you need on the Basel III ratio, the SLR could be the constraining factor for you guys and the peers. How do you think about how much SLR you need to run? And is there some opportunity to optimize that more so than say the Basel ratio? ","Ruth Porat","Well, at this point as he said we got a strong excess above requirement on risk based capital and given the SLR it is not required until 2018 as I just said. We were looking to get to 5% in 2015 and here we are at 5% now. So we don't view that as a constraint on our ability to return capital. At this point, there are continues to be opportunity to mitigate as really primarily and reduction of the gross- up in the balance sheet, net long CDS sold and compression activity, obviously the ratio will continue to benefit from earnings but more in the gross up on the balance sheet and when you look across the ratios, given all that we've done with the business and given the strength of where we stand today and capital, that's why our view is we set ourselves up well to continue to steadily increase return of capital over time. Our philosophy is no discontinues move but steady increases over time and that's what we remain focused on.","Matt O'Connor","Okay and just separately a follow up question on the changes to the comp structure. Am I thinking correctly that essentially taking the charge on the cash, deferred cash piece, that will benefit you the most in the early years and then less later years?","Ruth Porat","It will continue to benefit us. So it is -- both of them benefit us and that's why we are free setting the comp ratio here today. ","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. And please proceed with any closing remarks. ","Ruth Porat","Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter conference call. We look forward to speaking to you again in 13 week.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation."],"14928":["Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Q3 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call October 16, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Sharon Yeshaya - Investor Relations","James Gorman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Analysts","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Mike Mayo - Wells Fargo","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Steven Chubak - Wolfe Research","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW","Sharon Yeshaya","Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During today\u2019s presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James Gorman","Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us. Over the last several years we have focused on a number of things. Firstly, taking actions necessary to fix the obvious and immediate problems that we faced, secondly putting a strategy in place, the right strategy which was focused on a balanced business with more effective risk controls, and thirdly, meaningfully investing in our culture to ensure we remain an important choice for top talent and manage our business with professionalism with whatever challenges we face.","These strategic choices were designed to ensure that as much as we can control, the firm does well in a strong market environment and demonstrates stability in a seasonally or structurally more difficult one and that is exactly how 2018 is shaping up. The first half of the year was characterized by strong market environment and increased levels of client activity. Commensurate with that backdrop we delivered returns above the top end of the ROE target range of 10% to 13% of that first half period.","The third quarter of course was impacted by the traditional summer slowdown and a more fragile trading environment. Even so, we delivered an ROE of 11.5% and an ROTCE of 13.2%. These are comfortably within our target ranges and firm revenues of $9.9 billion. In prior periods through 2008 when we delivered revenues of $9 billion to $10 billion we had a leverage ratio of 30 to 40 times. Obviously, we have dramatically changed the way we conduct our business.","What was most pleasing in Q3 was the stability across the whole franchise. Though we can clearly have aberrations in any one quarter, we believe that we have set a floor while at the same time created significant upside potentials. Investing in our talent and building out our leadership team is an essential ingredient to what we see as an exciting path forward. Our ability to attract talent from across the street, relatively low attrition levels, and high employee satisfaction are all hard evidence of the strong culture. Our challenge is to make sure this endures not the weeks, months or even years, but for decades to come.","With Q3 now behind us we look forward to spending more time discussing growth opportunities in the months and years ahead. In the meantime, we remain confident and optimistic about the near-term prospects with a strong finish through 2018.","I'll now turn it over to Jon who will discuss the quarter in detail.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you and good morning. The results in the third quarter demonstrated strengths despite the typical summer slowdown. Our performance illustrates the resiliency of our business model and the ability to perform across an array of market environments. We reported revenues of $9.9 billion and PBT of $2.9 billion. Diluted EPS was $1.17, ROE was 11.5% and ROTCE was 13.2%.","Institutional securities performed well. Investment banking benefited from continued strategic activity and new capital formation globally. Compared to historical third quarters equity's results were strong. Fixed income showed stability despite seasonally slower client flows and a lack of larger transactions. Wealth management delivered another solid quarter and investment management saw continued positive long term net flows although investment results were impacted by weaker emerging markets.","We continue to benefit from the inherent operating leverage of our business model. On a year-to-date basis, our efficiency ratio was 70% and almost 200 basis point improvement compared to the same period last year. Increased expenses have primarily been driven by higher compensation and execution related costs associated with the higher revenues.","Our discipline around discretionary spending has allowed us to continue to make investments across the firm especially in technology. Although we typically see a seasonal increase in expenses in the fourth quarter, we remain confident we will hit our full year efficiency ratio target.","Now to the businesses, institutional securities generated revenues of $4.9 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date revenues of $16.7 billion are up 17% versus the same period last year benefiting from active global markets, increasing revenue pools and stable to improving wallet share. Non-compensation expenses were $1.7 billion for the quarter, an 8% sequential decrease, driven primarily by lower execution related expenses and compensation expenses were $1.6 billion, bringing the year-to-date compensation to net revenue ratio revenue to 34.5%.","Investment banking reported revenues of $1.5 billion down 14% relative to the second quarter reflecting a normal seasonal slowdown in activity. Notably this is our best third quarter in over a decade contributing to our record year-to-date revenues. Advisory revenues for the quarter were $510 million. M&A volumes remained at historically high levels supported by larger strategic transactions and cross border activity. Pipelines remained healthy and dialogues are active.","New issue market conditions remained favorable in the quarter supporting strong underwriting results. Equity underwriting revenues were $441 million. Activity remained healthy across products and regions with particular strength in IPOs. Americas were strong throughout the quarter while Asia and Europe saw some seasonal slowdown in August before a strong September.","Fixed income underwriting revenues were $508 million. Increased results in investment grade issuance partially offset a slowdown in high yield financing relative to a very active second quarter. Event driven transactions remain a significant driver supported by the active M&A backdrop and our ability to leverage our global franchise to provide holistic client solutions.","Investment banking pipelines remained constructive across products and regions. For the remainder of the year strategic activity should support both our advisory and underwriting businesses. Of course client activity could be affected by continued or new macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. In addition, protracted periods of heightened volatility may impact issuers financing plans.","In Equity Sales and trading, we retained our leadership position and expect to be number one globally. Revenues were $2 billion down 18% quarter-over-quarter. Sequential revenues declined across each business line as the quarter was characterized by low market volumes and more subdued volatility compared to the first half of the year. Still, activity remained robust across products relative to historical third quarters particularly in Europe and Asia. Prime brokerage had a strong quarter benefiting from our investment in our global client footprint and derivative results were also strong aided by a diversified product set and client mix.","Fixed income revenues of $1.2 billion were down 15% versus the second quarter. Seasonality and low rate volatility in the quarter impacted Europe in particular which contributed to the sequential decline. Overall, revenues remained solid and are up 8% year-to-date. In our macro business we saw strong client activity in FX, supported in part by idiosyncratic events across emerging markets. Rate was negatively impacted by range-bound yields and low volatility globally.","Our credit business saw a sequential decline on lower client activity across product areas. Our institutional lending franchise continues to demonstrate good balance sheet velocity. In commodities revenues were up as client activity remained robust. The results were supported by macro movements within the energy complex. The fixed income results reinforced that this business is well-positioned. Despite seasonal headwinds this quarter our revenues remained solid.","Turning to wealth management, organic growth drivers of the business remained strong. In the quarter we saw net fee-based inflows, higher fee-based assets, and a continued increase in lending balances. The growth in these metrics supported higher asset management and net interest revenues contributing to the 2% sequential increase of total quarterly revenues of $4.4 billion. The business continues to demonstrate significant operating leverage. On a year-to-date basis, revenues of $13.1 billion are up 5%. Non-compensation expenses were up only 1% over the same period and total non-interest expenses are up 3% resulting in PBD growth of 11%. In the quarter the margin exceeded 27%.","Total client assets of $2.5 trillion is up $85 billion or 4% compared to last quarter as markets showed gains and clients continued to add new money to their accounts. Net fee-based flows also remained strong at $16 billion contributing to 3% growth in fee-based assets which now stand at $1.1 trillion or 45% of total client assets. This quarter represents the 12th consecutive quarter of fee-based assets growth.","Asset management revenues for the quarter were $2.6 billion up 2% on the higher asset levels. Net interest income was $1.1 billion for the quarter up 3% sequentially. Higher NII was primarily driven by increased earning assets as higher asset yields were offset by higher funding costs. This includes the impact of the cash sweep program redesign.","Wealth lending in the U.S. banks grew by $1.1 billion to $71.1 billion with increases across each major product line. Year-over-year loan growth stands at approximately 7%. While the transition to our in-house mortgage platform impacted production earlier this year, we are currently in line with pre-conversion levels. We saw growth in the mortgage portfolio for the first time since this transition.","In addition to the traditional decline in retail engagement during the summer months, we saw clients continue to focus more of their fixed income investing into shorter duration products at lower commission rates. However, due to the impact of positive mark-to-market on deferred compensation plans total transaction of revenues of $698 million remained essentially unchanged. It is worth noting that the contribution of transactional revenues have steadily declined. On a year-to-date basis transactional revenues represent approximately 16% of total net revenues versus 22% in the same period three years ago.","This quarter's results once again demonstrate the stability and health of our wealth business. Segment revenues grew supported by annuitized revenue drivers and pretax profit reached new highs. Year-to-date results demonstrate that we can steadily grow this business while continuing to make investments into tools to support asset growth, increase client engagement, and improve cost efficiencies.","In investment management, we saw continued positive long-term flows $3 billion in the quarter supported by strength in overseas distribution. Total net revenues were $653 million, a 5% decline relative to last quarter. Asset management fees of $604 million were essentially flat sequentially. The increased fees on higher average long-term AUM were offset by lower feels and liquidity primarily driven by the wealth management cash sweep redesign.","Our overall fee rate in this business remained stable. On a year-to-date basis, asset management revenues are up 13% on strong investment performance and positive flows particularly in our active fundamental equity strategies. Investment revenues were $40 million down 27% sequentially impacted by continued market volatility in FX and emerging market equity performance. Overall expenses of $551 million were essentially unchanged.","Turning to the balance sheet, on a sequential basis total spot assets of $866 billion are down $10 billion. Our standardized RWAs of $370 billion decreased by $17 billion over the quarter driven primarily by lower credit RWAs on reduced lending and commitments through syndications and pay-downs in the quarter. As a result, our Basel III standardized common equity tier-1 ratio is expected to be approximately 16.7%. Our supplementary leverage ratio remained flat at 6.4%.","During the quarter we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of common stock or 24 million shares. Our Board declared a $0.30 dividend per share and our tax rate in the third quarter was $24.4%. As we look ahead to the first quarter we are cognizant of the seasonal headwinds, but we are encouraged that we are off to a good start. Strong volumes and increased client engagement associated with the recent pick up in volatility, have benefited the franchise thus far. Of course while bouts of volatility can support revenues, sustained volatility can erode confidence and close market access. We have not seen that to date.","We believe that the economic backdrop is strong characterized by broad global growth. Assuming these macro conditions persist, clients are active and markets remain open and functioning. We will press our advantages and look to continue to gain wallet share.","With that, we will now open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. My first one is on deposits, they've been definitely in focus for the wealth management side and I know you gave some comments on that Jon, thanks for that, but we had the first wave I believe of CDs, your CD program that was scheduled to mature over the summer, so it would be great if you could maybe let us know what sort of customer behavior you've noticed with that money and what portion of that cash are you retaining and what kind of products are customers moving into with that cash?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure, so as you mentioned we did have some CDs mature during the period. What we're generally seeing although this is all new for us since we've just gotten into these products over the last 18 months, is that a good amount of those dollars go into the investments accounts of those clients while some portion gets retained in the savings product. So while that hasn\u2019t been retained in the bank it has been retained in the system. Those dollars continue to go into both equities and fixed income. We have seen a little bit more of a shift into the fixed income investing than we did probably what we saw in 2017, but all in all it has been sort of both a nice way to supplement liquidity in the bank, but also bring in new assets to the firm.","Brennan Hawken","Terrific, thanks for that. And then on the equity side you guys \u2013 trends and the share gains have been really impressive. I know this might be somewhat of a high class problem, but do you have any thoughts or insights into how your customers are thinking about concentration risks? Are there any limits to thinking about further share gains particularly in the financing side of the business?","James Gorman","Listen Brennan, as you mentioned we've gained significant share over the last four or five years. I think what we're benefiting from now is more of a stable share in a growing market. The equity product this year is up pretty dramatically over last year and it has been down for a couple of years in a row, so this is a good positive play. And I think we do believe that we can continue to growth share, although at slower paces.","We continue to invest in the franchise particularly around both product, people, geographies, international footprint and technology. So I would say that we feel very comfortable with our share. We feel very comfortable we will be able to maintain that share and there are pockets where we continue to believe that we can grow that share but it would be at a slower pace than we've seen in the last five years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Mike Mayo","Hi, can you hear me?","James Gorman","We can Mike.","Mike Mayo","Okay, good. Just could you elaborate a little bit more on the deposit strategy in growth and it just seems to be getting a little bit more competitive with more of the banks pursuing a national digital banking strategy. What are you seeing, at what point would you pivot your strategy based on what you're saying?","And then a separate question, I don\u2019t recall, do you disclose net interest margin and if you do what has it done and what you expect it to do?","Jonathan Pruzan","I'll go with the second one first. The answer is no. Again, we try to focus on the net interest income in the wealth business and you can see that that business the NII has grown about 4% to 5% year-to-date.","On the first question, it\u2019s a good question Mike, and we continued to make investments in the liability structure. We\u2019ve talked about promotional CDs and savings. We're working on new premier cash management products and we continued to enhance our digital strategies around both payments and deposits for our client base.","We're at historical low levels of cash and client accounts and our deposits are really more impacted by sort of our clients asset allocation than actual rates. The debate is on our deposits have actually outperformed our models and continue to outperform our models, but what we've seen whereas cash levels had been sort of 8% to 10% for quite some time. They\u2019re now down at about 6% and what those do after or -- in light of some of the market volatility is really a question that we\u2019ll have to see as the markets evolve, but we\u2019ve been in a prolonged bull market if you will and we\u2019ve seen those cash levels go down.","So at this point I don\u2019t think we\u2019re thinking about changing the strategy. We're continuing to invest in the product suite. You can see that we have grown deposits a little bit quarter-over-quarter. Our clients are very open to the products that we\u2019ve been offering and when we run promotional products and rollout new offerings we seem to see a very good take up. So again at this point competitive business, but we feel good with our position.","Mike Mayo","And then just one followup, that\u2019s interesting about the cash levels from 8% to 10% down to 6%, what\u2019s been the range of those cash levels like over last 5 or 10 years?","James Gorman","I think over 5 I would say 8 to 10 but not down to 6 on 10 I don\u2019t have that data, but it\u2019s been in that 8% to 10% range for a while.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","James Gorman","Good morning.","Matt O'Connor","The revenue obviously was strong this quarter. It\u2019s been strong year-to-date. It sounds like it\u2019s off to a good start this quarter, but as you look at the stock it's obviously been under a lot of pressure this year and I think its concern over the sustainability of revenue. But as you think about the cost side and if you can just talk about how much flexibility there is to bring in costs if the revenues come in weaker say next year than you expect?","James Gorman","Matt it's James and I think I\u2019ll take that question because I too have been wondering about the price action on the stock. It\u2019s interesting the ROE and ROTCE are up 40% year-over-year. Revenues, on annualized basis were up 12%. We\u2019re hitting all the pre-tax margin numbers that we said were above the ROE range we said we\u2019re comfortably within the range that we talk about below 73% on total compensation and the stock is down at least pre-market this morning it was down or last night 7% to 8% year-to-date.","So it\u2019s kind of little bewildering against the backdrop of a very strong U.S. economy and we\u2019re overweight the U.S. and gaining share across each of the institutional businesses. So I guess there are smarter investors than myself out there who have got this figured out. But to me it seems like with the ROE up 40% and the revenue trend that we've got it\u2019s a little hard to reconcile with the stock being down. So what I care about frankly is the long-term positioning of the firm.","This firm is positioned for resilience through cycles, that\u2019s exactly what we demonstrated in this quarter, to deliver $9.9 billion of revenue in a summer quarter that was unheard of a couple of years ago. And look at some of the metrics where the resilience are, I was just looking some numbers this morning around the assets that are in wealth management sitting inside the $10 million plus household and many of those households are many multiples of $10 million.","Back in 2009 that number was slightly over $400 billion. As of today it\u2019s well over $1 trillion and that money is not going to go away, that\u2019s very sticky stable money than the next segment of million to 10 million the same. So if you look at the share question that came up about the - particularly the prime brokerage part of equities, I mean the reason we\u2019ve gained share in equities is it\u2019s hard to make money if you're not in the top three.","The industry is consolidated. In fact those with superior technology and great franchises have gained share because clients want that far from there being concentration risk clients have wanted to be with two or three players and we have obviously been a huge beneficiary because we have in my humble opinion best-in-class equities business across the street.","So yes, back to the sort of near-term on your question, if the market turns then we respond. We do what we needed to do on the expense side and we obviously have some cushion given that we\u2019re running with an ROE currently of 13.1% year-to-date. So I\u2019m very confident about the outlook. I\u2019m confident about our ability to respond if the market turns if we\u2019re going through a complete major crisis environment which I do not expect at all, then obviously we\u2019d be affected along with everybody else. But in a normal downtick in the market, yes we pick up some volatility and then over time our revenues would trail off a little bit, but the fundamentals are very strong.","Matt O'Connor","Thank you. And I think the other concern obviously is the capital deployment and the results from 2018 CCAR, but it seems like you\u2019re addressing that or trying to building capital, I don\u2019t know if that was simply the \u2013 what's going on in the market or specifically response to the CCAR results if you could comment on that and then if there is still further optimization that you can do to the CET-1 after going up 90 bps this quarter?","James Gorman","Well, it\u2019s obviously, it\u2019s kind of a platform where goes the market from here, the second question is what is likely to evolve on the regulatory front, not just in 2019 but over the next three or four years. And if you look at what we did last year obviously, we did a distribution equivalent to what we did -- what we\u2019re approved for the previous year, since then year-to-date we have accreted $6.9 billion net income to common. By the way full year last year was 6.6, so through three quarters we're at 6.9. Our capital distribution should go up. There is just, I mean that why wouldn\u2019t it, our dividend is still below reasonable payout ratio, I think it\u2019s in the low 20s, 23% or something, it is $0.30 a quarter, so that is about 20%.","Frankly, we\u2019re making too much money to keep holding it there. Now, at the same time and at the stock, good news is stock trading at 43 bucks, you are buying back a lot of stock with that distribution. Now over time if the stock trades back to where I think the value is reflected in the ROE performance, then you have got different strategic choices as to how you distribute the capital.","But I can\u2019t imagine a scenario over the next several years where we don\u2019t have significant buyback programs just because we are accreting so much capital and we\u2019re \u2013 and unless you can find ways to invest that in the business to generate those kinds of returns, I think it is shareholder friendly to have a strong dividend, have strong buyback and make the appropriate investments to build growth into the business. But we can kind of do all three when you\u2019re producing nearly $7 billion in net income in nine months.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning guys. This is [indiscernible] on for Michael Carrier. Just sort of quick question, I\u2019m wondering your peers highlighted the increased competitive environment in ISG, I think specifically in FICC with tighter spreads. I don\u2019t know, can you let us know what you are seeing, is this just the usual strong players just competing more aggressively given the lower volatility or are you seeing some more like reinvigorated competition from maybe the European peers?","Jonathan Pruzan","Well, I would just again, I don\u2019t know if this quarter is any different than any other quarter, ISG across the complex of Fed, equity as in investment banking is very competitive, it\u2019s always been competitive and we continue to either maintain our share or grow our share. In the fixed income space we have picked up share over the last several years since the restructuring which is why we\u2019re so confident that the position of the business is in such good shape. We are running probably 10% to 12% share when we use to run 6 to 8 and we\u2019ve seen our ability to grow that share even though the pool of revenues are not really growing.","As I mentioned earlier in equity is very competitive business but we have a comprehensive business in offering and as James mentioned best-in-class and we continue to maintain our share and capture growing revenue pool. And then in banking the global footprint and the stability of our franchise has led to some really strong results and we picked up share in banking. So again, a very competitive environment. We expect to continue to maintain and grow our share given the stability and the momentum in the franchise and it\u2019s always going to be a competitive market.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks for the detail. I guess as a quick followup, given the volatility that we\u2019re seeing in like the EM and Asian markets start 4Q, can you give us an update on what how this impacts your business maybe specifically in IM or it\u2019s like the investment line?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. As I mentioned earlier the investment line was impacted this quarter because of some of the volatility in both the rates in emerging markets. As you know some of our alternatives and equity strategies are in Asia, so I think it will continue to see some impact from that. But I think again that\u2019s the sort of the tail on the dog, the primary driver of revenue growth for us in that business is going to be around the fee-based assets and we continue to see continued good flows into our long-term assets. The last seven quarters, we have seen $20 billion of inflows and active management, active strategies are working for us. So again it will have some impact, but we feel very good about the overall health of that business and we have seen very stable fee rates there too which is another reason we feel good about that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Guy Moszkowski","Good morning. There was a comment in your press release on institutional securities that the other sales and trading net losses were down quite a bit versus year-ago reflecting lower net funding costs and I was just wondering, I mean it was a big enough numbers that it\u2019s meaningful and it sounds like a great thing but how do you reconcile that with higher interest rates?","Jonathan Pruzan","So you read our press release, I\u2019m impressed. So listen Guy, there is a lot of things in that line, some of which is the hedging activity and other things that flow through that. We also have some assets in that business, basically the businesses have been optimizing their balance sheet and their funding and that sort of collectively the net result being the statement we made in the press release that the net funding costs are down, it\u2019s really based on usage not rate.","Guy Moszkowski","And is there any sustainability to that or just in terms of overall funding costs or it was just something that was helpful this quarter?","Jonathan Pruzan","I think it was helpful this quarter. That number is going to be volatile because there are a couple of things in there, that sometimes offset each other, sometimes they don\u2019t but really it\u2019s a function of how much liquidity that businesses require and how we optimize the balance sheet and again that has some variability to it. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily bank on it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thank you. Further on the conversation of stability, I mean wealth management, investment management are half the firm's revenues. Considering 45% is in fee based accounts and you\u2019re lending efforts or deposit efforts, the comp trends the only offset I see is the lower transactions. I mean this is a market sensitive business obviously, but can pre-tax and that combines business grow in a flattish market environment?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, I mean it depends how you manage the business. I mean as you pointed out a lot of the revenues come from non-market related activities. And secondly there is shift in market related activities. So money moving from transaction accounts hurts the transaction revenue but as it moves into asset management accounts, it improves the revenues. So the net is actually net gain on the switch of assets as they occur clients move out of transactions into managed money.","So there is a lot of stuff going on in that business and obviously next year we\u2019re seeing the recruiting deals coming off which relating to the merger with Smith Barney and we\u2019ve also been doing just less big ticket recruiting for the last several years. So the annual to cover the deferred recruiting expenses is coming down each year.","So, yes I would say, I mean modestly I wouldn\u2019t there is not some massive jump likely across wealth and asset management in a flat market environment, but there is definitely operational improvements that can be made.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. And believe it or not I also read the press release. There was something in there in the institutional business on a modest gain on the sale of the business just curious on how big and what business that was?","James Gorman","Yes, that was deal that was announced I believe in the second quarter, it closed in the third quarter. We were an owner of a business called the MuniCenter and it was a good, I am just trying to see the line item, it was a good percentage of that line item. It was about $60 million, $61 million, $62 million.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steven Chubak","Hi good morning.","James Gorman","Good morning.","Steven Chubak","So I just wanted to start off with a question on equity market sensitivity and James it was interesting to hear your perspective on some of the factors weighing on the stock and maybe some of the underappreciated revenue stability. It appears to us that one of the big concerns is your higher sensitivity to movement in equity markets and equity market declines which certainly comes to mind given the latest move. I was hoping you can give us some insight about how you think about earnings resiliency in a sustained market correction and given some of the commentary around the movement in cash balances how much of an offset you think that can provide if equity market weakness persists?","James Gorman","I mean listen, we had a more challenging third quarter, both from market activity and just seasonal volumes and we delivered an ROE of 11.5% in that environment, so and tax adjusted that's probably [10% to 0.25%] [ph] for what it would have been last year. The best we've done up until then was on an annual basis it was 9.4%. So that's in a pretty subdued trading market and not - definitely not robust equity market environment.","I think though if you look across the franchise there is still M&A transactions getting done. The prime brokerage business is very resilient. There's still trading across the fixed income businesses whatever's going on in the equities and we\u2019ve improved our share in the macro space. We've always been a little stronger in the macro.","And then in micro SPG and the other credit businesses well positioned. So we're not as correlated to equity market movements as I think is sort of believed if you actually look at the stability of the franchise across each of the businesses. Now clearly if you have a sustained correction call it 20% every year, we're affected by that. I mean I\u2019m not naive about it, but as we just saw or in a quarter which wasn\u2019t a great equity market quarter we had $9.9 billion of revenue and we've only ever had two quarters of more than $10 billion in revenue and that was the first and second quarter of this year.","Steven Chubak","Thanks for that color James. It's very helpful. And maybe just one follow up on operating leverage, clearly demonstrated strong expense discipline in the quarter 200 bps of efficiency improvement year-on-year. It seems like the Street is contemplating some revenue growth from here in line with GDP, but numbers suggest that there is some skepticism that will translate into positive operating leverage. I was just wondering from your perspective, how you think about balancing the need to continue to deliver margin improvement versus some of the higher investment needs as you look out to other growth opportunities?","James Gorman","Yes, I don't - I honestly I think you're raising a very good point and I don't - if that's the view of some people on the Street I don't understand that view. I mean, there's obviously operating leverage in a business that has the scale that we've got across wealth management, across the prime [brokerage] [ph] space, the core large investment banking businesses the incremental dollar revenue is coming on at a much higher rate than the embedded dollar revenue across all of our businesses.","So unless you get - yes we've going to have to invest, but that's part of what's called the incremental dollar of revenue to come on at 30% margin rather than a 50% margin, that's part of the investment profile. But to the assumption that you would not generate operating leverage with revenue growth it just doesn't add up to me and it just hasn\u2019t been the experience. We've had year-to-date 12% revenue growth and the expense ratio has dropped from 73% to 70.3%. We haven't done anything to consciously reduce expenses.","We haven't shut businesses, we haven't sold businesses, we haven't had a major [ref] [ph]. In fact we've had huge investments. We opened - just opening another fusion center for our cyber in Singapore. I was out there a couple of weeks ago and we continue to invest in the cyber space. We're continuing to invest across all of our technology platforms, in automation, in AI and big data or cloud computing, digital, our whole digital initiative across wealth management expansion across the asset management businesses and building out new platforms, raising new funds. All of these are investments that we're making continuously and we've been hiring talent. So there's just no way if we produce another $3 billion of revenue that you're not bringing that on at a high margin than the existing margin that is just not going to happen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham. Your line is open.","Jim Mitchell","Hey good morning. Maybe just following up James on the stability of earnings and revenue and how that translates to capital, because I think the, I guess one of the issues I struggled with I think investors have struggled with is you have sort of the biggest drop in the stress test in CET1. And that obviously could have an impact if and when we moved to the SCP. So how has dialogue gone, how do you convince or think about stress tests and how that impacts your ability to return even more capital given that your ratios are dramatically higher than your peers?","James Gorman","Yes, well Jim it is the question and I'll start and we should spend some time on it and I want Jon to weigh in on this because he's been pivotal to all the discussions we've had in DC and with our regulators. The first question is, are you capital sufficient? And that was addressed squarely last year with notwithstanding the results of the test under what most would suggest were unusually stressful scenarios, let me just put it that way, that we and other banks we're all committed to distribute the same level of capital that we distribute in 2017. So that basically says check, you are capital sufficient.","The second question is are you accreting capital above what you need to support the investment of the businesses whether it's investments you're making, whether it's growing sheet in different parts of the business and as I said with net income this year already at $6.9 billion, we're heading for an $8 billion plus net income the record I believe was $6.6 million last year. So clearly, we are accreting capital above what our investment needs are.","The third question is what will the regulatory environment the rules permit you to do? And we're in a transition period. I mean we're going from a pure CCAR structure to an SEB structure. I don't believe that change - in fact I'm sure that change is not going to happen for 2019. So 2020 on it will. There remain several open questions, how do you calculate so on just a more narrow that sort of 2019 CCAR, will there be changes to the scenarios that would generate a different kind of outcome from 2018?","In other words was 2018 the high watermark in terms of scenario severity. I believe it was, but until we see the scenarios, we - I don't know. I mean we don't have access to that information, but I would suggest it is highly likely that we have seen the high watermark. And by the way that high watermark translates into us suffering losses many times the size of what we actually did during the crisis, so it is a high watermark.","The second is then how does the model apply themselves to the particular make up of individual firms and that translates into your stress losses, your PPP&I et cetera and again I don't want to prejudge that. I'd like to just sort of see that play out, but worst case is we will not be worse than last year and we have accreted more money than last year. So by definition we should be in a better position than last year.","The more interesting has been 2020 on will there be accounted cyclical buffer put in as some have suggested, I doubt it. Is the stress test buffer, the SEB buffer likely to remain at the initial levels that were put at that remains to be seen it won't get worse. It could come down a little bit to make it more consistent with what the Europeans and foreign banks are dealing with.","So I guess my simple summary and I\u2019ll shut up and turn to Jon is we've hit the high watermark in terms of stress scenarios. I mean at some point, you can stress anything. You could have capital equal to the size of your balance sheet, have a leverage ratio of 1 to 1, but obviously it\u2019d shut down your economy. So at what level do you pass the inflection point where you're doing, you are affecting economic growth rather than generating it? And I think we've peaked at that level. That's my guess. And in this transition it will play out that we will as we keep accreting at this level we should be able to increase that capital distributions. Exactly how much, we have to see what the models produce. Jon?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, I think James actually was pretty comprehensive. I do agree that we\u2019re in this transition period. We've been encouraged by the comments regarding tailored supervision. We've been encouraged by the comments by both Chairman Powell, and Governor Quarles around the industry being appropriately capitalized which we have said since 2016, we believe we are sufficiently capitalized and we are starting to accrete more capital and currently in the forward 12 months going to payout less than 100%.","So over time we will continue to either invest in our business or return that capital. So again we think we\u2019re capital sufficient. We think the regime is going to go through some changes and we believe we'll be able to continue to offer our shareholders an attractive capital return profile.","James Gorman","And the last thing I'll just add to this is, two bugaboos that I had for a long time and communicated very directly is it\u2019s hard for me to imagine a scenario where your balance sheet grows during a time of financial stress and deflation of financial assets. And secondly, I don't understand why boards would continue to do a full capital distribution for nine quarters after an economic crisis, financial crisis has occurred.","Under the current thinking around the SEB structure, our balance sheets would not grow, that obviously makes both intellectual and intuitive sense, and secondly I believe that the capital what you would be required to continue to distribute would be just dividends for one year. Now these rules are in, they are in some state of development and comment period, so I don't know where it ends up.","But both of those things would suggest that the constraint that has been most powerful for Morgan Stanley which has been our leverage ratio because that balance sheet grows, if your balance sheet is not growing, then that opens up a whole different kind of discussion and as you pointed out at the beginning we get back to CET1 or total capital ratios our numbers are phenomenal. So we've got we got to see how this thing plays out, but the bottom line I believe we've hit the high watermark and move past it.","Jim Mitchell","All right, well that was comprehensive, I appreciate it. If I could just maybe ask one thing unrelated to capital, just on the - I think there has been a lot of concern about NII growth from here, is your sense that at least could you update us on kind of the pick-up in yields in growing the loan book versus the securities portfolio as you kind of see that loan growth, should we expect and margin can continue to move a little higher?","James Gorman","Yes, I think that is the right characterization. I think the last quarter we mentioned that we saw NII growth in the 4% to 5% range for the year, we are still comfortable with that. We also said that it would be driven by average earning asset growth or loan growth and that's really what's been driving it. If you look over year-to-year, average earning assets are up about $7 billion or $8 billion and that is really primarily driven by the loan growth and that's primarily driving the NII growth.","We have seen healthy increase in asset yields, but as we mentioned earlier, that's really been offset really by the change in mix of our liability structure not beta\u2019s per se. But if you go back in time we used to have one product which was a suite product. In the third quarter of 2017 that represented closer to 90% of our deposits, today it represents closer to 75% of our deposits.","So that increasing asset yield has been sort of absorbed by the increase in the liability costs and therefore average earning asset growth will be the primary driver and we're still pretty comfortable with our ability to grow loans and our wealth business in the last couple of quarters, we've been growing at $1 billion to $2 billion a quarter and that feels healthy to us and that also feels sustainable.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Devin Ryan","Thanks. Good morning. I guess a follow-up question here just on the growth strategy and outlook in wealth management. I know some of the things you've highlighted are gaining more wallet from existing customers in the high net worth channel which you\u2019re obviously growing, expanding relationships with younger customers through technology and then marketing to the stock plan participants. So I'd just love it if you could maybe touch on all those channels in terms of the longer term potential and then any anecdotes that maybe is making you feel good about where you are with some of the newer initiatives like the younger customers who are penetrating kind of the stock plan, I'm assuming that's where we'll see growth accelerate as well?","James Gorman","I think you've done a nice job of articulating where we think we're going to get growth from in the business and really I think the biggest opportunity long-term and either or medium to long-term is really around asset aggregation our ability to attract incremental assets from our customers. We know they have a lot of money outside of the firm and some of the encouraging anecdotal stories as we roll out some of these new strategies is that our clients are much more open to sharing their financial information with us.","I think years ago it was sort of you didn't want to aggregate all your assets at one firm, I think we are seeing a little bit of a shift in that and as we roll out asset aggregation and the next best action and some of the programs that we've been rolling out to the FA community, we are seeing good take up in that.","I would say the stock plan growth and the younger client growth, both of those are also sort of in their infancy in terms of the strategies and the implementation and they should long-term be attractive ways to aggregate assets. Remember a lot of the young clients don't have as much wealth as our older clients, so it's going to be a slow build, but we continue to make the investments in the digital strategies and the stock plan program to be able to position ourselves to bring in more assets over time. So I think the most immediate opportunity is really trying to attract incremental assets from our existing client base.","Devin Ryan","Okay, great. And then just a followup here would be maybe good to get a little bit more perspective on just the investment banking activity levels in the various businesses and then clearly, some concern in the market just around kind of being late cycle. And so, I'm just curious if you guys are actually seeing those kind of normal signs of late cycle activity whether it would be over extending on deals or over paying or just indiscriminate buying, just anything that would tell you that we're kind of little late cycle in those businesses?","James Gorman","Other than the fact that it\u2019s late cycle, we actually haven't really seen any real indications. The healthy, pipelines are very healthy. If you look at the pace of announcements in M&A, they haven\u2019t slowed down. The capital markets are open. Our IPO and debt underwriting backlogs are healthy and we're bringing things to market. Now if we get into a period of prolonged volatility, that might close access, but we haven't really seen it.","In the leverage loan market, it's been liquid and orderly. You know that\u2019s the cash flow driven market and cash flows are quite healthy, so a lot of activity in that space. There's been some repricing, but deals are still getting done inside of flex and for good deals, we see a lot of good support. So other than we\u2019re late in a cycle, we haven't really seen any real indications at least from our business perspective.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you, good morning.","James Gorman","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","I apologize if you guys addressed this, I had to jump on and off your call, but the first question is how quickly do your customers in wealth management expect to see higher interest rates passed on to them in there, I know you mentioned Jon that I think cash is down to about 6% of everybody\u2019s portfolios, but how quickly do they expect when the Fed funds raises rates, do you have to rise your rates within days of that to keep them satisfied?","Jonathan Pruzan","You know again, I think you've got to think about these deposits for what they are and historically these are really transactional, people have them in the bottom of their investment accounts to transact, to buy and sell securities, to have a little extra liquidity and what we\u2019ve seen is as an investment thesis the percentage of cash that people are holding is lower and that is what we\u2019ve seen reflected in the system.","In terms of rate rises, we\u2019re very competitive with our primary competitors in this space. We have our beta tab outperformed our model betas, so it's really not as rate sensitive if you will, it's really asset allocation sensitive. And as people reduce their cash amounts we'll see continue outflows. That being said we're in a prolonged market rally here and historically if we go into a different market environment we've seen people pull cash out and put it back in their accounts. It is very similar to sort of checking accounts, I mean it's the same sort of dynamic. So the answer is betas have outperformed and it\u2019s really an asset allocation versus a rate sensitivity. ","Gerard Cassidy","Very good, and then the second question is more of a qualitative question from what you guys are seeing out in the markets, clearly credit quality across the banking industry is very strong today. Your consumer wealth management area high quality, you don't have much trading risk anymore with the VAR being where it is, but what are you guys seeing or what are your folks telling you that they are seeing in the so-called shadow banking sector the leverage lending area. We're hearing that there seems to be some aggressive underwriting going on, is that a concern for you folks 12, 24 months down the road or just any color you can give us on what you guys are seeing out in the markets?","James Gorman","I mean my gut, Jon is going to say something we're going to have to wrap up in a couple minutes , but my gut is I - if other people want to engage in dumb practices God bless them, but we're not and that's what I'm focused on. So yes, there's always somebody out there right who's doing the marginal deal. What I care about is and that's not going to blow up the market, but what I care about is overall asset bubbles or not and we're not in one and then how we\u2019re participating.","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, and so I mean, I think specifically I agree with James specifically and our portfolios we've actually seen improving metrics in the ISC credit quality. We\u2019ve got good velocity there, so we've been very active securitizer in some of our product, and then on the wealth side you said it's been very stable. We've not been impacted by some of these unfortunate hurricanes that we've seen across the country and very, very stable metrics for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your line is open.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, thanks. Yes, just a followup question on the corporate lending. It looks like the non-investment grade exposures are down quite meaningfully year-on-year and then you also saw some drop downs too in the commitments sequentially. Are you guys actively de-risking in the loans and lending business and in the institutional securities business?","Jonathan Pruzan","The answer is we're not actively de-risking. We saw a couple of dynamics in the September numbers we were fronting some deals which is why it looks like that we had a much higher exposure to non-investment grade when in reality we didn't really have those exposures because they were syndicated across the bank lending, excuse me, the bank syndicate.","And then on the de-risking point we just saw a lot of activity around the event book and as I mentioned earlier we're also active in the commercial real estate securitization market. We skewed more of our business in that area towards securitization versus held for investment just given the profiling where we are in the cycle. So again, we've been very disciplined around it. That was really a function of just a lot of activity in the third quarter and we expect to continue to sort of rebuild those pipelines and be active in those markets.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay and then just one followup real quick, you mentioned the clients are moving a fewer providers within the equities business and I thought that trend started a few years back for the prime brokerage business, is it still early innings for cash business as well as derivatives business?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes and I think we are the number one provider of those services. We've got a very strong franchise there. We have seen a little bit of consolidation with MiFID going into places people to reduce the number of counterparties they deal with, but I think the general comment was generally the top providers, top three or top four or top five depending on the market where the products have generally been gaining share and we would expect that trend will continue.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

The Firm\u2019s results in the third quarter were strong. Fee-based client assets and lending balances continue to build in wealth management, contributing to a 28% margin. Institutional Securities revenues were $5 billion with solid performance across all divisions, despite a mixed trading backdrop and investment management, assets under management surpassed $0.5 trillion as strong performance continues to attract positive long-term net flows. In aggregate, the firm produced an ROE and ROTCE of 11.2% and 12.9% for the quarter.","Before Jon takes you through our results and answers your questions, let me share a couple of thoughts. The wealth management business is powerful. A $2.6 trillion of assets annualizing over $17 billion in revenues and margins at historic highs, the business is clearly stabilized in the firm. I am convinced there remain several meaningful avenues for growth. The biggest is we look to aggregate assets held away. Our core client segment should see significant asset growth over the next decade.","Further expansion of our services across the wealth spectrum from the highest end family offices to employees service through Morgan Stanley at Work provides us with the potential $4 trillion asset opportunity, also international opportunities, particularly Asia and continued growth of our loan portfolios are among the exciting opportunities that remain in this business. But the most attractive part is every incremental dollar revenue is arriving at a high margin than the margin of the existing business. And while you may not see this expansion over any individual quarter, over time, the business will grow and the margin will expand.","Our Institutional Securities business mix has proven to be very resilient. Against a relatively difficult trading environment characterized by some seasonality and volatile markets, we performed well. This segment made $5 billion in revenues and for the fifth time out of the last seven quarters, and it underscores the strength of our client franchise in all three lines of the business, investment banking, fixed income and equities.","We\u2019ve been the beneficiary of client share consolidation to date and expect this to continue as competitive dynamics evolve. Finally, our asset management business is well-positioned in the most attractive growth segments in the public and private markets with our leading active equity strategies and significant alternatives and solutions platforms. The growth in assets and profitability of the last few years are a testament to the refocus on this business. And as I said earlier, we passed $0.5 trillion in total assets with positive net long-term flows.","One ongoing challenge of our continued pursuit of higher ROE performance has been the amount of equity we\u2019re required to hold, despite how we\u2019ve repositioned the firm to benefit from the more stable revenue streams.","To address capital which of course drives ROE, our current constraint is the leverage ratio. As the Federal Reserve adjusts the capital framework, we expect the focus will transition to CET1 which should benefit us in the aggregate.","Given global competitive dynamics, the strength of the brand, the stability of the institution, there is reason to believe, we can gain share in several of our businesses. The combination of growth, stability and potential for share gains leaves me with confidence that there remains tremendous upside here.","Overall, we remain cautious today as trade talks swirl and interest rate paths continue to be debated, but expect us to look beyond the next few months and focus on continuing to enhance the stability of the franchise and growing the business. Our job is to continue to manage this institution for the long term.","All of that said, I don\u2019t want to take away from the strength of the quarter and I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jon to discuss the results in greater detail. Jon?","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you, James, and good morning.","In the third quarter, Firm revenues were $10 billion, representing the fifth quarter with revenues over $10 billion out of the last seven, and our highest third quarter in over a decade. The 2% sequential revenue decline from the prior quarter is reflective of seasonal trends. PBT was $2.7 billion and EPS was $1.27, resulting in an ROE of 11.2% and an ROTCE of 12.9%. Year-to-date, ROE and ROTCE are 11.8% and 13.5%, respectively.","Total non-interest expenses were $7.3 billion in the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, total non-interest expenses declined 1% and our efficiency ratio was 72%. As we continue to invest in technology, workplace enhancements and the integration of Solium, we remain focused on controlling more discretionary expenses, particularly marketing and business development and professional services.","Now to the businesses. Institutional Security revenues were strong, particularly in September. Despite a mixed market backdrop, revenues of $5 billion were the highest for a third quarter excluding DVA in 10 years. Non-compensation expenses were $1.9 billion for the quarter, increasing 5% sequentially on higher volume-related costs driven by increased client activity. Our compensation to net revenue ratio remained at 35%.","In the context of fluid markets including trade and political uncertainty, economic growth concerns and central bank responses, we remain focused on serving our clients, while actively managing our risk.","Investment banking revenues were $1.5 billion, increasing 4% sequentially. The quarter-over-quarter increase was driven by improvement in fixed income underwriting and advisory, particularly in the Americas. Notably, fixed income underwriting produced record revenues as issuance activity accelerated. Advisory revenues increased 9% quarter-over-quarter to $550 million. Completed M&A industry volumes increased supported by larger strategic transactions.","Underwriting results were robust. While equity underwriting saw a sequential decline, it was more than offset by the strength and share gains in our debt capital markets business. Equity underwriting revenues declined 27% to $401 million. Following a particularly strong second quarter, IPO issuance witnessed a notable decline partially offset by convertible issuances. Fixed income underwriting increased 39% sequentially to $584 million on the strength across both investment grade and leveraged loan issuance. Activity was particularly strong in September. Issuers took advantage of the rate environment and the summer backlog of event-driven transactions was executed.","Overall, our pipelines remain healthy. CEOs are engaged and confident and strategic activity is supporting both our advisory and underwriting businesses. However, conversion from pipeline to realized remains highly dependent on market conditions.","In equity sales and trading, we retained our leadership position and expect to be number one globally. The quarter was strong with revenues of $2 billion. The 7% sequential decline was consistent with seasonal trends.","Prime brokerage revenues rose sequentially. Higher financing revenues supported by an increase in average client balances were partially offset by regional seasonality. Cash revenues saw a slight decline versus the prior quarter on lower global volumes. However, revenues here were resilient as we have an increased share in a consolidating market. Volatile market conditions weighed on derivatives performance.","Fixed income sales and trading revenues increased 26% sequentially to $1.4 billion, driven by the strength in the credit complex. Micro results were robust across all major business lines, particularly securitized products. Activity levels were high and balance sheet velocity remains an area of focus and has improved versus last year. While macro revenues increased sequentially, absolute performance was impacted by a challenging environment, particularly over the first half of the quarter. Sequential results benefited from increased client activity, including structured transactions. Commodities revenues improved quarter-over-quarter driven by North American Power and Gas. Investments declined $212 million sequentially.","The prior quarter benefited from realized gains associated with an investment\u2019s IPO and subsequent mark-to-market gains on remaining holdings which partially reversed in the third quarter.","Wealth management revenues and pretax profit were $4.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The business produced a PBT margin of 28.4%, while continuing to absorb expenses related to technology investments and the Solium integration. On a year-to-date basis, the PBT margin was 27.9%.","Asset management revenues were $2.6 billion, up 4% quarter-over-quarter, benefiting from the improved asset levels we saw at prior quarter\u2019s end. Total client assets ended the quarter at $2.6 trillion, in line with the prior quarter. Net fee-based flows were strong at $16 billion. Fee-based assets now comprise 46% of total client assets, up from 45%. We expect the secular increase in the allocation of assets towards advisory to continue.","Transactional revenues were $595 million, down 18% from the second quarter. Transactional activity remains subdued. Seasonally slower client activity, a weaker equity calendar and negative movements in our deferred compensation plan investments impacted results. Retail investors remain cautious given the continued uncertainty around the outlook.","Net interest income was $1 billion, up 3% sequentially. On a year-to-date basis, net interest income was unchanged. Excluding impacts of mortgage prepayment expense, NII year-to-date is up mid single digits. Loan growth was strong as balances are up 3% sequentially and 8% versus last year. We continue to see good receptivity of our lending products and expect loan balances to continue to grow at a similar pace annually.","We saw stable BDP levels this quarter and continued success at raising deposits. Putting these NII components together, strong loan growth and more stable deposits will be more than offset however by the current and expected rate path.","Total expenses were essentially unchanged compared to the second quarter, despite the integration of Solium. The impact of higher compensable revenues largely offset the movements related to our deferred compensation plans. Non-compensation expenses were effectively unchanged. Our target margin is 26% to 28%. This quarter, we pierced the high end of that range. As always, there could be movements quarter-over-quarter but full-year results will be solidly within our range.","Investment management produced revenues of $764 million. The business saw a strong and broad-based positive net flows and assets under management surpassed $0.5 trillion. The growth story for this business remains intact. Year-to-date revenues are up 17% and the business is running nearly $1 billion more revenues versus 2016 levels. The investment environment remains constructive as investment revenues were $105 million. As we have previously said, this line has the potential to be lumpy, though we continue to see the benefits of broad-based performance across our private funds.","Total AUM increased to $507 billion of which long-term AUM was $335 billion. Positive net flows drove the higher AUM. Our equity strategies continue to deliver strong investment performance, driving net inflows. And we are beginning to see the benefits of the investments we have made into our fixed income platform with the second consecutive quarter of net inflows.","Asset management fees of $664 million increased 8% sequentially. Performance fees were aided by a non-recurring realization in the quarter. Additionally, management fees benefited from rising average AUM.","Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets rose to $903 billion, driven by increased client activity which also drove growth in RWAs. As a result, our common equity Tier 1 ratio declined to 16.2%.","During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $1.5 billion of common stock or 36 million shares at an average price of $41.92, and our Board declared a $0.35 dividend per share.","Our tax rate in the quarter was 21.4%, excluding $89 million of intermittent net discrete tax benefits. These discrete tax items added approximately $0.06 to EPS and 50 basis points to ROEs. We continue to expect our full-year tax rate will be in line with the 2018 tax rate, excluding intermittent discrete items.","As we look ahead, we\u2019re cognizant of the seasonal patterns of the fourth quarter, but we are encouraged by client engagement and activity levels and are off to a good start. We are pleased with our competitive positions as the industries continue to see share consolidation and we are executing on our growth strategies.","With that, we will now open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Mike Mayo","Hi.","James Gorman","Hey, Mike.","Mike Mayo","You are certainly making progress over time with the ROTCE 13%, but you\u2019re doing that when you look at year-over-year where expenses grew faster than revenues. And I know it\u2019s just one quarter but non-comp expenses were up 7%, comp was up a little bit. What sort of confidence do you have that revenues will grow faster than expenses, if not just for the quarter, but for the next year and how are you thinking about that relationship?","James Gorman","Mike, firstly, that\u2019s what we are paid to do. If we\u2019re in a business where we\u2019re growing expenses faster than revenues long term, we\u2019re not kind of very good business. So, we\u2019re maniacally focused on it. And you\u2019re right, in any given quarter obviously, you\u2019re going to see bumps and bounces a little bit. We had slightly high litigation this quarter relating to some stuff way back 10 years ago from the crisis, and some of that just sort of makes its way through the pipes at different moment, so. And the BC [ph] was quite active given the activity, particularly in September. Some of the integration stuff relating to Solium, various other things, some of the tech spend we\u2019ve been doing, developing out our tech platform. But, I\u2019m not -- frankly, I wasn\u2019t concerned about that. And I would say, I\u2019m certainly not concerned about it for the next year. We intend to maintain the discipline that we\u2019ve brought to this place for the last several years, and that\u2019s not going to change.","Mike Mayo","All right. And then, just as a follow-up, I guess, there were some one-timers, you didn\u2019t really specify the amount. So, just generally, as it relates to technology and improving efficiency, where can you see the efficiency ratio going over the next one or two years?","James Gorman","Well, I\u2019m not going to get ahead of what we do at the earnings call in January where we lay out our expense targets. I think, we\u2019ve taken the efficiency ratio, forget where we started this, but it was certainly in the 80s and target originally was $0.79 on the $1 than $0.77, $0.75, and I think we\u2019ve been -- last year was -- this year\u2019s $0.73. We -- listen, we\u2019re generating scale economics. Look at the wealth management business. I think, non-comps were down about $10 million or $20 million including some costs that we\u2019re absorbing relating to the integration. There is no reason why those non-comp numbers need to grow in that business. We\u2019ve made a lot of investments the last few years. We\u2019re starting to realize the benefit of those. Rob Rooney is leading a major reformation of our technology platform internally and it has the full focus for the organization. And while we are having to -- and wanting to spend on some of the new technologies that are obviously coming to the market, we\u2019re also taking costs out from what has been a legacy system that hasn\u2019t been terribly efficient over the last 20 years.","So, I think, I\u2019m not going to give you an expense ratio number now. That\u2019s obviously premature. But, we\u2019re clearly focused on the long-term scale leverage in this business.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, this quarter, we saw a pretty significant move by the discount brokers moving commissions to zero. Obviously, transactional revenue is easiest part to commoditize. But, there are some investors that are concerned that the next move that they could make could be against advice. Do you consider that a threat? And, do you think that your recent tech investments have placed you well or there is still wood to chop on that front?","James Gorman","Why don\u2019t I have a go at this and Jon may want to add something. Firstly, I wasn\u2019t surprised that the online brokers went to zero commissions. I was surprised at the timing, frankly. I think, given the backdrop with where rates are, it was curious timing, but it is what it is. And as you point out Brennan, I think,, the commission activity of buying and selling stocks and bonds in our wealth management business is a very small percentage of that business, and obviously, half of that for the whole Firm, given that it\u2019s less than -- it\u2019s about 40% of the firm wealth management. So for us, it\u2019s a whole different discussion. You\u2019re rightly questioning, will there be pricing pressure on advice. I mean, at the level, the clients are paying, I think it\u2019s in the mid 70 basis points, Jon will correct me for advice on dollars of assets. It\u2019s a great value equation. I mean the advice pricing holds up as long as clients are getting value. And when you put together the research, the trade execution, the financial planning, tying people in with their long-term charitable, giving their trust and estate planning, working with their accountants, it\u2019s complicated stuff. And being wrong on this and the tax implications are being wrong absolutely overwhelm a few basis points on the fees.","So, having high quality advisers giving high quality advice is in my view a winning strategy. The real question is for what level of assets is it relevant. And you\u2019ve seen in our business for households between zero and 100,000 in the last 10 years has dropped precipitously. That is not an accident. That\u2019s by design. We basically price that segment out of the core channel into the online channel for a reason. Somebody with $39,000, as I\u2019ve said many, many times does not need a financial adviser and won\u2019t get the attention of the financial adviser. But households with more than $10 million just with us, and bear in mind, those households tend to have two to three relationships like that have grown dramatically over the last decade. And that is the sweet spot for what we\u2019re doing for our business between $1 million and $10 million and more than $10 million. That\u2019s where the growth is. And in my view that is where the advice fee is very fair and very reasonable given the way you create it.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for all that color, James. That\u2019s helpful and very extensive. One follow-up here. You guys recently bought Solium. You\u2019re in the process of integrating. You guys made reference to that with your comments around Morgan Stanley at Work. That might be a platform that\u2019s a little closer to where the discount brokers are. Is this -- do you think this might impact that business? Do you think that might impact a little bit of the potential returns on that investment or was this part of the scenario planning that you guys undertook when you made the acquisition that eventually commissions would head in this direction and competitive pressure would take you there? Thank you.","Jonathan Pruzan","So, Brennan, it\u2019s Jon. We\u2019re still very excited about the Solium acquisition. It\u2019s very early days, but the integration is going well. We\u2019re continuing to put money and investments behind the integration. The receptivity of the product, Morgan Stanley at Work has been quite good. We\u2019ve actually seen a pickup in new client wins. We\u2019ve won about 265 clients -- corporate clients since the closing of that transaction, and the product receptivity is quite high. This combination of sort of state-of-the-art technology and platform for stock plan administration with financial education and tools for investing in savings is going over quite well. Additionally, we continue to convert our business onto their platform, and that\u2019s going well. So, early signs and early days, but the integration is going well.","And in terms of the economics and how we think about this business, it was really to get access to a younger and different client base. It\u2019s a direct channel. As James mentioned, there is about 2.5 million employees in these companies with $1 billion -- or excuse me, $1.5 trillion of assets away. And we\u2019re going to start using our digital tools, our virtual advisers to provide service for those clients. And that\u2019ll be priced competitively. And we still think the economics of that channel and getting into that business is a very attractive one for us. So, early days, going well, and we\u2019re still really excited about it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Gerard Cassidy","James, you touched on capital with the leverage ratio being your binding constraint. And you also indicated that, as the Fed adjusts its capital framework, it will shift to the CET1 ratio. When do you think that shift may take place? And then, when you look at your CET1 ratio, clearly, it\u2019s the highest amongst all your peers at over 16%. What\u2019s a good number that you think is more appropriate, once we move to the CET1 ratio?","James Gorman","Gerard, you are asking me to step into lion pit here. Listen, I think, the Fed has been really constructive and stepping back and looking at what\u2019s happened with the regulatory framework. It was obviously critical to have the banks, recapitalize, raise their liquidity and build discipline around that. And I think the health of the U.S. banking system, if you look at the results of our peers in the last week, is clearly reflective of that. I think, all of them are in dramatically better shape than they were 10 years ago, including Morgan Stanley.","I think, I\u2019ve argued for a long time publicly and privately that a simple leverage ratio is a constraint when it\u2019s not looking at what is the intrinsic quality, and liquidity of the asset on the balance sheet does not make sense, levering illiquid security versus a treasury. It doesn\u2019t make sense in terms of treating those equal, and much more relevant to the business is where our risk weighted assets lie. So, I think, this change which has been advertised by the Federal Reserve as the likely, I should say, it\u2019s up to the Fed and their own rule-making, I\u2019m not going to presume it, but as the likely outcome of this transition seems to me to be sensible. And most people would agree with that. It\u2019s certainly gives investors and rating agencies and regulators a much better sense of where the risk lies within the firms. That said, none of us want to get back to the pre-crisis leverage ratio where banks were levered 30 to 60 times.","So, as to the specific timing, I don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t want to pre-guess that. But it\u2019s not years, it\u2019s in the sort of months period is my guess. And what that translates for us again, I think, it\u2019s probably -- it\u2019s a little early to get into that. I just think it\u2019s hard for me to see a scenario where our capital stay flat or go up. So, I start off that simple premise. Therefore there is only one alternative. How much change that delivers depends on what the SCB buffer is and a bunch of other factors that would go into the new regime. So, a little bit wait and see. And once we see what we\u2019re dealing with, then, we will act accordingly as an institution.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. I appreciate your insights. And then, Jon, you talked about on the equity trading that the cash revenues in the consolidating market helped boost the cash revenues. What\u2019s driving that? Is it just economies of scale? Is it the technology that you guys have on your desk that\u2019s driving more business that way? And then, when you look at your cash equities relative to prime brokerage or derivatives, is that the largest contributor to the equity trading number?","Jonathan Pruzan","So, the answer to your first question is really yes and yes. It\u2019s economies of scale and it\u2019s technology. Additionally, we\u2019re seeing some people step away from that business. We\u2019ve got a really good technology kit, obviously. Here, we\u2019ve seen an increase in our percentage of the trading volume. The volume is down a little bit. But, as I said, it\u2019s been pretty resilient. And we think that you\u2019ll continue to see consolidation of share in that business, and that\u2019s an opportunity for us. In terms of the different businesses, obviously, prime brokerage is our biggest business. It\u2019s sort of the center of the machine, if you will. We\u2019ve got a really nice mix of both people and intellectual capital and technology that sort of drives the entire plan. And as I said, we\u2019re number one in the globe there for about the last five years. So, it\u2019s a very strong and powerful business. Between cash and derivatives, that will bounce around quarter-to-quarter based on client activities, but the PB business is clearly the biggest.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Jim Mitchell","Hey. Good morning. Maybe just talking a little bit about wealth management flows. I think, fee-based asset flows of $16 billion were pretty strong relative to what we saw at one of your competitors. How much of that is being driven by just the shift from brokerage into fee-based versus just solid organic growth that you\u2019re driving through I guess, more focused franchise?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. We were pleased with the flows and we continue to think that we\u2019re very-focused on attracting both new assets, and we\u2019re continuing to see that secular trend of people wanting to convert their accounts into the fee-based format because of the services provided and the value proposition. So, it was a good mix of the different dynamics, new assets as well as flows from our brokerage. And we expect to continue to see that. We\u2019re now at about 46%. That number has been creeping up; we expect it to continue to creep up over time here.","Jim Mitchell","And maybe just a regulatory question, now that we have a final Volcker Rule. Any thoughts on the impact you guys, doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s big, but just whether it\u2019s expenses, revenues, how do we think about that at all?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. Again, there is a final rule out, but there is still some additional, incremental adjustments that will be made. But from our perspective, it\u2019s not really -- have a material impact. It\u2019s clarified a few things for us, maybe simplified it a little bit, but no real impact.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Christian Bolu","Good morning. Maybe just on equities, and this one might be a bit of an unfair question, given the good job Ted and team have done in that business, but I\u2019ll ask anyway. If I look at market share relative to the U.S. peers, it looks like it peaked at the end of 2017 and has basically steadily drifted down. So, curious kind of what -- any color on what\u2019s driving this, sort of the leverage constraints, you alluded to an issue, and maybe anything else you\u2019ve seen on the competitive front in that business?","Jonathan Pruzan","I\u2019m not sure I know what you\u2019re referencing. When we look at the global market, we\u2019ve grown share over the last couple of years and it\u2019s stabilized over the last year or two in sort of the 21% share type numbers. We do think there is opportunity to grow that. We\u2019re not going to see the lockstep jump that we\u2019ve seen historically, but there are share consolidation going on, particularly in the cash market. We think there\u2019s opportunities in derivatives, as well as James mentioned, Asia continues to be an interesting market as people divert more capital into that market. So, again, we\u2019re very pleased with the results. It\u2019s a competitive market. It\u2019s always been a competitive market. I think, you\u2019ve seen over a long period of time a real shift from or a consolidation into the top two or three providers, most of that has come from probably the European peers. So, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance, we\u2019re very pleased with the position.","James Gorman","You might also be referring to -- there has been a shift obviously from the European into the U.S. banks in some of the prime brokerage balances and other parts of the equities business. And, we always look at business opportunity in terms of what kind of returns we can get. So, we\u2019re not just trying to drive share, we\u2019re trying to drive profitable share. And as Jon said, what we look at, at global numbers not regional numbers, frankly.","Christian Bolu","Okay. I can -- I mean, when I look at you relative to the U.S. peers, you\u2019re about 31% in 4Q, and it started 27%. But, I hear your point on global versus Europe. Maybe switching to wealth management, just on the zero commission discussion on the online brokers, trying to get exposure here. I do appreciate that it\u2019s probably small. But, it\u2019d just be helpful if you could detail how much you make on ticket charges and if you hear any pressure from the field to sort of reduce any sort of trade ticket charges?","James Gorman","I mean -- I don\u2019t have the details on how much we make per ticket. We don\u2019t really look at it that way, because obviously, Christian, as you know very different types of businesses within it, whether it\u2019s for a $300 million family office, somebody liquidating a large concentrated position or the average investor selling a $1 million of stock or $100,000 of stock or whatever. So, it\u2019s just not -- that\u2019s not really the way we focus on. But certainly, I\u2019ve heard nothing. Jon, have you heard anything from the field? Nothing, I don\u2019t think so.","Jonathan Pruzan","No noise from the field. And again, I think that the business model is different here. And our clients are looking for more than zero dollar trades. They\u2019re looking for the value proposition that we put forth. And we haven\u2019t heard anything really from the field.","James Gorman","Yes. An adviser who is working hard and is being paid by commission rather than by a management fee wants to get paid. I mean, that\u2019s the deal. It\u2019s not an after profit. So, they\u2019re not exactly calling up and saying take away our revenues from us. They want to get paid fairly for the job that they\u2019re doing. So, I\u2019d be very surprised if we had any feedback on that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI Group. Your line is now open.","Glenn Schorr","First one on wealth management, please. So, the $4 trillion held away, I get the Solium piece straightforward and in motion of the 2.5ish held away in wealth management accounts. I\u2019m curious if you could talk to some of the more specific things you\u2019re doing to incent clients to consolidate with you. I mean, we\u2019re seeing part of it each quarter, but that\u2019s a drop in the really big buckets. I\u2019m just curious on the tactics of what you\u2019re doing?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. I mean, it\u2019s really around, again, the value proposition but also a lot of the technology investments that we\u2019ve made. Clearly portfolio construction and execution costs have been commoditized. And so, we\u2019re trying to provide the financial planning and service to our clients. We\u2019re really doing it with our technology around four places, advice; service; relationship management; and asset acquisition. On the asset acquisition side, I would say the best or the most impactful technology we have is really around both asset aggregation and our risk analytics. It allows us to do stress scenarios and testing real time. So, it\u2019s not paper-based on different scenarios and look at concentrations. And once we have a much better picture of all our clients\u2019 assets with our asset aggregation tools, we found that we\u2019ve had an ability to attract more of their assets. So, it\u2019s really around the technology that we\u2019re developing to try to drive that asset acquisition. And then, we\u2019ve enhanced our digital experience, we\u2019re enhancing our client experience, and we think all of that leads to a better ability to attract those assets.","The other last point I would make is, those assets in the high wealth or the high net worth bucket are actually growing quite fast as well. So, it\u2019s not only the incremental assets they have outside of the firm, but their assets inside of the firm, and their wealth are growing quite quickly.","Glenn Schorr","And are you still periodically doing specials, if you will, on cash management products to bring over assets in a low rate environment? Do you still have room to reduce wholesale funding and bring in some more deposits?","Jonathan Pruzan","We do. I\u2019m not -- we\u2019re not really -- your comment around specials, we\u2019ve developed a new high-yield savings account, which more attracts sort of Fed funds, if you will. We\u2019ve seen great receptivity to that. I think, about $12 billion of new money has flowed into Morgan Stanley in the last two quarters. And that does come in at attractive rate relative to the wholesale or the CD market. So, there\u2019s a good spread there. So, we continue to develop the products, and we\u2019ve seen really good receptivity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Chubak","So, I wanted to start with a question on the capital strategy. And James, you\u2019ll have to indulge me. I\u2019m going to ask you to step a bit deeper into the pit. But, ahead of the SCB implementation, the big sticking point with many investors is the higher CET1 burden, which at 16% is 250 bps above your next peer. That gap translates into roughly a 200 basis-point drag on your return. So, certainly has a material impact on the valuation. I know, you\u2019ve spent many an occasion talking about the shortcomings in the models. We looked at prior transcripts, I think, going back as far as 2014 publicly. But despite those efforts, we really haven\u2019t seen the progress. And given the slow progress that\u2019s evident, if the Fed doesn\u2019t seem receptive to the changes, I\u2019m wondering if you can give us some context as to what alternative actions you can take to potentially reduce that capital burden?","James Gorman","Steve, I think, you want to give the Fed a little bit of credit here. I mean, there actually has been progress. Just the change in the rules around -- and I\u2019m not talking specifically on Morgan Stanley from them, but the change in rules around which banks are designated as systemically important, the change in the qualitative test and taking away that sort of qualitative hurdle and just relying on annual supervisory letters, the changes that have taken place in the Volcker Rule, more transparency that came through the last CCAR proposal, the openness of the Fed to consider, not counting buybacks and dividends against capital basis, and the potential removal of the leverage ratio is sort of the gating constraint on firm\u2019s capital positions, the movement towards the SCB structure. And when we see how all of this plays out, and as I said earlier, I forget who asked the question, I think it was Gerard, how we feel this playing out, we will then -- we\u2019ll have a better sense of what our capital needs are. As I said, they\u2019re not going up. That much I\u2019m confident about. And I don\u2019t think they are staying flat.","And then, you look idiosyncratically at Morgan Stanley, obviously we\u2019re affected by the leverage ratio; we\u2019re also affected by the PPNR modeling and the expense structure within the models where as I said on the last call, we find quite a disconnect between what we\u2019re doing and what the models would suggest our expenses would do in the time of systemic stress. And that\u2019s a discussion we\u2019re having very openly with the Fed. And for the first time this year, we have some transparency as to where the source of that difference is, which enables us to dig in on it.","There is a different openness for 10 years into this for addressing some of these issues of the Federal Reserve. Obviously, there\u2019s different leadership on the supervisory side from the last 10 years. And I think it\u2019s prudent to step back and figure out what\u2019s right for the industry. The financial sector is critical to the health of the economy. Having banks properly capitalized and not overcapitalized is the essential for them to grow their balance sheets and provide lending capability to businesses and individuals.","So, I\u2019m not going to take you bait and try and get into what if they are next, because I don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to be in the next couple of months. I\u2019d rather wait and see that. We have shown a willingness to adjust our business model over time. And I think the build out of the wealth management which is -- was clearly part of that strategy, build out of asset management of strategy and the stabilizing revenues within the institutional business as we\u2019ve gone away from the prop trading and the more volatile parts of the fixed income franchise. So, it may not satisfy you, but I\u2019m not going to get into a guessing game. I\u2019d rather see what the results are and see what we\u2019re dealing with and then deal with it.","Steven Chubak","Okay. Fair enough. I appreciate all that color, James. And just one follow-up for me on NII. Based on the forward curve, it\u2019s pricing in roughly two cuts through 2020. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us some expectation for what the NII trajectory might look like for 4Q and 2020.","Jonathan Pruzan","Why don\u2019t I try to take that? And, I think for 4Q, given that we\u2019ve already had two rate cuts last quarter, the benefits of the higher loan growth -- or excuse me, the higher loan balances as well stabilization of the BDP will be more than offset by where rates are, in terms of the absolute level. In terms of next, so that\u2019s a fourth quarter look. So a negative bias towards NII. And then, obviously, as we get into the fourth -- excuse me, when we get into next year, we\u2019ll give you some more thoughts around it. There is just a lot of variables right now. But, clearly, a low rate and a declining rate environment, puts negative pressure on NII.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Devin Ryan","Just I guess first one following up on Steven\u2019s question. If NII is moving lower, how should we think about, I guess, the comp ratio in wealth management, all else equal, just given kind of the positive comp dynamics that creates?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. I think, as we mentioned in my script, compensable revenues has ticked up a little bit as a percentage. And so that will impact the comp ratio. But, we\u2019re very-disciplined, obviously across the platform, specifically in wealth management around comp. And I think, you\u2019ll see sort of some stabilization, but the mix is important.","Devin Ryan","Okay. Thanks, Jon. And then, I guess, the follow-up here just within investment banking. So, you mentioned in the script that backlogs are healthy. It does seem that the equity underwriting backlog has been strong but some of that keeps getting pushed forward. And then, the M&A outlook still -- it seems constructive. But, as we move closer to U.S. election, I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re hearing anything around corporate sentiment there. So, maybe if you can just talk a bit more about the tone within the various investment banking businesses right now and anything else you can add around kind of the near-term and intermediate-term outlook as we move into 2020?","James Gorman","Why don\u2019t I start? And Jon can add in as he indeed was a former investment banker. I guess, you\u2019re always an investor. Right? So, I mean, the discussion -- CEOs are obviously concerned about the direction of the trade talks and that this stays within sort of guardrails of reasonableness. Nobody wants to see a global economic slowdown. On the other hand, financing is cheap, people remain confident about the U.S. economy, and transactions are getting done. And, I think the backlog has been healthy. The advisory number was strong. As you pointed out, some of the ECM numbers with some of the deals that came to market of the last several months and things that got pulled. That has put a little bit of a dampener on that. On the other hand, we made a major push with our DCM business, and I think you saw the results. I think, our share was around 14% this year -- this quarter, which is the best share we\u2019ve had for many years. So, I think, there is still a sense where despite all the naysaying and all the news and all the pundits, the reality is the U.S. economy is in good shape and the consumer balance sheets are in good shape. People are continuing to spend the -- earnings coming out of the last week or so demonstrated very solid performance across the board. So, I think, it remains stable. Jon, I don\u2019t know if you disagree on that.","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. No, I would agree. And I think, as James mentioned, CEOs still feel pretty good about where they are. And at some point, you just can\u2019t wait for every unknown to settle down and what we\u2019ve seen is CEOs have strategic imperatives and initiatives that they want to execute on. And they\u2019re doing that, because the markets are constructive. M&A market continues to be active. We think we\u2019ll have probably another $3.5 trillion type year, which is a very healthy M&A market and there is a potential to do that again next year. The lot of the ingredients behind M&A around the search for growth and scale and synergies, LBO and sponsor activity, all of that\u2019s still intact. So, a healthy environment. Now, we can\u2019t have a dislocation or a break in the market. But right now, the healthy -- pipelines are healthy and the market is constructive.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Mike Carrier","James, you mentioned upfront some of the market share opportunities that you still see. You provided some color on the $4 trillion in wealth management. I guess, just on the institutional securities, you guys have done well over time. But, what initiatives are in place now to increase share, whether it\u2019s on the banking side or the trading side?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. I think, in the simplest, you\u2019ve sort of highlighted our growth strategies. Right? We\u2019re clearly trying to grow assets, both in the investment management and the wealth management business. And we\u2019re looking to grow share in ISG. And I think it\u2019s just a lot around execution. We continue to see opportunities in Asia, we continue to see opportunities within investment banking to consolidate share, and as I mentioned, in equities we continue to see more share go to the top providers who offer a differentiated service. So, we feel good about the momentum in that business. We\u2019ve gained probably 3 or 4 points in share in all of the ISG business combined in the last several years. We like the momentum. And assuming the market stays constructive, we believe we continue to build share across all three segments.","Mike Carrier","And just a quick follow-up on the last question. Just on confidence in activity levels, you mentioned trade. If on the Brexit side we get some follow-through here, on the news this morning. How much is that weighed on activity, particularly in Europe versus the trade issues?","Jonathan Pruzan","Brexit specifically, it\u2019s probably most impactful in the UK. We did see some softness there, not dramatic. It would be nice to get something resolved. Obviously, the market doesn\u2019t like uncertainty. So, hopefully this deal will get approved and will get executed, and that will be taken off the table. I think, though the European results were probably more impacted just about the global growth dynamic and what\u2019s going on in individual countries than Brexit per se.","Operator","Thank you.

Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management\u2019s current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. ","The presentation may also include certain non-GAAP financial measures.

This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James P. Gorman","","Thank you, Celeste, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before I comment on our performance I\u2019ll reflect briefly on where we\u2019re as a firm and where we are going. The management team here\u2019s been together for almost five years and while we have accomplished a number of things there\u2019s clearly more we can do. In short, we do not think that this firm is close to reaching its full potential. The stability and cohesiveness of the team, significant depth of talent across the organization, commitment from our people, re-shaping of our business model all position us for significant growth, and I would call Morgan Stanley as a client focused firm and our philosophy has always been to do first class business in a first class way. With the current regulatory paradigm having a client-centric business model is key to sustainable success. ","The opportunities in front of us are based on increasing client penetration and accelerating new client acquisition and may include building on our leading position in [inaudible] cross-border M&A deals with particular success in Japan and our other strong banking franchises. The growth of our bank, both in wealth management and institutional securities, raising new fronts in merchant banking and real estate and the use of technology to improve the efficiency in which we serve our clients with a hi-tech, high touch approach across the entire franchise. Those are just some examples. ","Now turning briefly to the quarter, we grew our revenue and profitability quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in both wealth management and institutional securities. Firm wide revenues, excluding DVA were up 7% compared to the third quarter of last year. In the wealth management business our revenues grew 9% versus a year ago driven by the continued execution of our bank strategy as well as revenue tailwinds from high markets. Notably our margin improved to 22%. ","Fee-based assets as a percent of client assets increased to 38%, up from 36% last year and just 23% when we closed on the initial portion of the acquisition a few years ago. Revenues in all of our major institutional businesses were up versus a year ago. Investment banking revenues were up 35%. Fixed income results, excluding DVA were up 19%, notwithstanding continued reduction in RWAs. Our equity sales and trading revenues were high versus last year as we continued to execute across products and regions and that franchise remains number one in the world. The momentum of our businesses also drove continued improvements in our earnings and ROE. ","EPS excluding the tax benefits and DVA in this quarter and a year ago was up about 40% while our ROE on the same basis increased a 180 basis points to approximately 8%. We\u2019re not yet at exceptional levels but we\u2019re making consistent progress. For example we\u2019ve made progress in improving the returns and reducing the capital and expenses in fixed income and commodities over the last few years. We believe there may still be meaningful opportunities to optimize the remaining components of commodities beyond the recent TransMontaigne sale as we continue to drive for higher returns. ","In addition we\u2019re always vigilant with all our resources, especially the balance sheet. A final thought, we believe we remain well positioned for further capital actions given the magnitude of our fundamental strategic change and our improving earnings profile. The CCAR process is engrained in every aspect of our business. ","I will now turn the call over to Ruth to discuss the quarter in details. ","Ruth Porat","Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures. The impact of DVA in the quarter was positive $215 million with $132 million in fixed income sales and trading and $83 million in equity sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA firm-wide revenues were $8.7 billion, up 2% versus the second quarter. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the third quarter was 21%, reflecting a discrete tax benefit of $237 million or $0.12 per diluted share principally associated with the repatriation of non-US earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated.","Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders excluding DVA were $1.5 billion. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share excluding DVA were $0.77 after preferred dividends. On a GAAP basis including the impact of DVA firm-wide revenues for the quarter were $8.9 billion. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $1.7 billion. Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.84 after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was $34.17 per share and tangible book value was $29.25 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet our total assets were $814 billion at September 30, down from $827 billion at the end of the second quarter. Deposits as of quarter end were $124 billion, up $7billion versus Q1. Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $190 billion compared with $192 billion at the end of the second quarter. Year-to-date we benefited from strong global demand for our credit enabling us to pull forward issuance from future periods reflecting broad global investor participation. ","Turning to capital, although our calculations are not final, we believe that our common equity Tier-1 transitional ratio will be approximately 14.3% and our Tier-1 capital ratio under this regime will be approximately 16.1%.","Basel III transitional risk-weighted assets are expected to be approximately $415 billion at September 30. Reflecting our best estimate of the final set of reserve rules our pro forma common equity Tier-1 ratio using the Basel III fully-phased in advanced approach was 12.6% at September 30, up from 12.3% in the second quarter.","Our pro forma standardized ratio was 11.7%, up from 10.7% in 2Q. Pro forma fully-phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $423 billion. We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the U.S. final rule to be approximately 4.9% at September 30, up from 4.6% at the end of 2Q. These estimates are preliminary and are subject to revision. ","Turning to expenses, our total expenses this quarter were $6.7 billion flat versus the second quarter. Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In institutional securities revenues, excluding DVA, were $4.3 billion up 3% sequentially. Non-interest expense was $3.3 billion flat versus the second quarter. Compensation expense was $1.8 billion for the third quarter, up 3% versus the second quarter in-line with the increase in revenues and reflecting a 41% ratio excluding DVA.","Non-compensation expense for the third quarter was $1.5 billion, down 3% versus the second quarter. The business reported a pretax profit of $1 billion excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact of DVA revenues were $4.5 billion and the pretax profit was $1.2 billion.","In investment banking revenues of $1.3 billion were down 6% versus last quarter. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked number 1 in global IPOs and number 2 in global announced and completed M&A at the end of the second quarter. Notable transactions included in advisory, Morgan Stanley acted as sole financial adviser to Sigma-Aldrich in the announced $17 billion sales to German Merck. Morgan Stanley also acted as financial advisor to Dresser-Rand in the announced agreement to be acquired by Siemens for $7.6 billion in cash. ","In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as joint Bookrunner on the U.S. $25 billion IPO of Alibaba Group, the largest IPO in history. Morgan Stanley also acted as Lead Left Bookrunner and stabilization agent on the $3.5 billion IPO for Citizens Financial Group. The IPO represented the largest U.S. bank IPO in history and the largest U.S. financial institution IPO since 2007. ","In debt underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as Lead Left Bookrunner for Tyson Foods on its $3.25 billion of senior unsecured notes in multiple tranches to finance its acquisition of Hillshire Brands. This financing complemented our role as lead financial advisor to Tyson on its acquisition Lead Left arranger for an $8.2 billion committed bridge facility and Lead Left Bookrunner and stabilization agent for the $2.4 billion offering of common stock and tangible equity units. ","Advisory revenues of $392 million decreased 6% versus our second quarter results driven by lower results in EMEA and Asia Pacific. Morgan Stanley remains a leader in cross border activity.","Underwriting revenues of $948 million decreased 7% versus our second quarter results. They were strong for third quarter driven by equity underwriting revenues of $464 million, which were down 5% versus the second quarter, reflecting lower volumes in the Americas and EMEA partially offset by strength in Asia Pacific.","Fixed income underwriting revenues of $484 million were lower versus the second quarter primarily due to declines in investment grade and high yield bonds that were partially offset by higher revenue from loans. Equity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA were $1.8 billion, flat compared to last quarter. Results were strong across products and geographies demonstrating less seasonality than is typical for the third quarter. Solid client activity and the underwriting calendar drove cash revenues above second quarter levels. Derivative revenues also increased sequentially on higher client activity. Prime brokerage revenues were lower reflecting reduced activity in Europe.","Fixed income and commodity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA were $1 billion, flat versus the second quarter. Macro revenues were up significantly this quarter, most notably in foreign exchange which benefited from improved market conditions with higher volatility.","Securitized products and credit products revenues declined on lower secondary client activity and less favorable market conditions. Commodities revenues were meaningfully lower reflecting lower client activity and a difficult market environment. CVA was a benefit in the quarter. Other revenues were $225 million, up versus $108 million in the second quarter, driven by a gain on the sale of TransMontaigne and the sale of our retail property space. Average trading VaR for the third quarter was $42 million, down from $48 million in the second quarter. ","Turning to wealth management revenues were $3.8 billion in the quarter, up 2% sequentially. Asset management revenues of $2.2 billion were up 5% versus last quarter reflecting higher market and positive flows.","Transaction revenues were down compared to last quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $503 million essentially flat to the prior quarter, investment banking related fees of $224 million, up 5% versus last quarter, reflecting a pickup in closed end funds and trading revenues of $185 million, down 31% versus the second quarter, driven by primarily by lower marks in our deferred compensation plans.","Net interest revenue increased 4% to $601 million, driven primarily by higher revenues from our bank deposit program. Other revenue of $112 million increased versus the second quarter primarily due to the gain on sale of a retail property space. Non-interest expense was $2.9 billion flat versus last quarter. Non-compensation expense was $767 million effectively flat to last quarter.","Compensation expense was $2.2 billion, flat versus the second quarter. The compensation ratio was 58% down versus the second quarter driven by revenue mix including ongoing growth in net interest income. The PBT margin was 22.1%, up versus 20.6% in the second quarter. PBT margin excluding the benefit from the sale of a retail property space was 21.3% in the quarter.","Profit before tax was $836 million. Total client assets were $2 trillion, global fee based asset inflows were $6.5 billion, fee-based assets under management increased to $768 billion at quarter end, representing 38% of client assets. Global representatives were 16,162, essentially flat to the second quarter. Deposits in our bank deposit program were $129 billion, up $2 billion versus the second quarter. Approximately $116 billion were held in Morgan Stanley Bank. ","Wealth management lending balances continued to grow reflecting the ongoing execution of our bank strategy. Lending balances increased $3.5 billion in the quarter. Investment management revenues of $655 million were down 5% sequentially. In traditional asset management revenues of $456 million were up 5% versus the second quarter, driven by positive flows and higher markets and partially offset by lower marks and deferred compensation plans.","In real estate investing revenues of $113 million were flat to the second quarter. Merchant banking revenues were $86 million down 41% driven by lower investment gains in the quarter. Non-interest expenses were $467 million, down 4% from the second quarter consisting of compensation expense of $253 million reflecting a compensation ratio of 39% and down versus the second quarter, driven by lower marks on deferred compensation plans and the mix of revenues in the quarter.","Non-compensation expense was $214 million, up from $196 million in the second quarter primarily due to the settlement of a legal matter. Profit before tax was $188 million, down 8% sequentially. NCI was $18 million versus $7 million last quarter. Total assets under management increased to $398 billion driven by higher flows, partially offset by market depreciation driven primarily by foreign exchange. ","In conclusion, our outlook is guided by the meaningful transformation we've made during the last five years and benefits from growth in our most [annuity-like] businesses. First, our wealth management business continues to have momentum with growing profitability from the secular trend toward managed money. We entered the fourth quarter with a modest tailwind from stronger equity markets at the end of Q3 and clients remain engaged as they assess evolving opportunities in markets. ","Second, we continue to have earnings upside with ongoing loan growth in our bank. This remains a differentiated contributor because we benefit from asset optimization on a growing loan book even without the benefit of rising rates. As we enter the fourth quarter the pipeline for loan origination remains strong in both wealth management and institutional securities.","Third, our investment banking pipeline remains healthy. In advisory it is broad-based across industry and geography and generates financing opportunities. Ongoing market volatility may affect institutional results if it persists. However we view recent volatility as a repeat of a theme seen frequently during the last several years with growing activity levels across products and businesses building, only to be disrupted by macro events than followed by a reset. A reset could occur with recognition that stronger growth in the U.S. may offset challenges in other economies. ","Finally our capital and liquidity position continue to be a source of strength. Our healthy capital ratios on both an absolute and relative basis reflect the robust foundation and evidence of our ongoing successful execution of our business and balance sheet strategy. ","Thank you for listening. James and I will now take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And the first question will come from Glenn Shorr with ISI.","Glenn Shorr - ISI ","Hello. ","Ruth Porat","Good morning.","James Gorman","Good morning.","Glenn Shorr - ISI ","Good morning. Maybe just a quick one on the mechanics of this whole fair value of deferred comps that showed up in both in your comments in both investment management and wealth management. If I heard you correctly it hits both the revenue line and the comp line. ","Ruth Porat","Correct.","Glenn Shorr - ISI ","And can you just help us when and why that happens. ","Ruth Porat ","It's a function of the assets in the deferred comp plans. So they move as the market moves and it therefore flows through revenue in comp and in essence as you can see we went through the impact on both businesses as you know that.","Glenn Shorr - ISI","Okay. Do I need to care, meaning are they comparable amounts on the revenue and expense line and they net out to not a big impact.","Ruth Porat","Yes although by definition therefore implies a higher comp ratio but, yes they net out.","Glenn Shorr - ISI ","Understood. Okay, cool. Moving on, curious your comments about how you've extended the [rationale] book a little a bit, or a lot I should say, in the past but curious, [inaudible] your thoughts on NSFR, impact on prime brokerage, specifically in conjunction with the Feds recent comments on social and wholesale funding, just kind of how is it impacting, it's an important business for you, you're really good at it, how is it impacting how you run the business and the profitability of the business? ","Ruth Porat","So taking the two rules obviously both of which are at this point preliminary and we're looking forward to seeing the final rules. On the net stable funding ratio as you noted we frequently said that durability of funding is important and it's the way we run the firm and as a result, probably not surprisingly we think having a measure of long-term durability is appropriate and we spent a lot of time as you noted achieving this durability through proper ALM and we spent a lot of time walking everyone through how we\u2019ve done that within our secured book.","The challenge of being more direct in answering your question is the rule is preliminary but given all that we\u2019ve done we don\u2019t expect to make meaningful changes. And as I said we very much look forward to seeing what the rule is. And then on the city surcharge the increase for short term wholesale funding is somewhat similar given the fed has only provided the broad contours, so what the rule is going to be is unclear, how it\u2019s going to be implemented and in particular, how it\u2019s going to be calibrated.","I think obviously the entire industry has some elements of wholesale funding and we\u2019ve often said not all wholesale funding is created equal, very much to your question. Our view is that logic would suggest that proper calibration would incorporate not just size but the quality and durability of funding in particular given the fed has recently published an article about durability in the industry and when I noted in a recent conference and it\u2019s just too early to know but again given all that we\u2019ve done and given the strength of our capital positions we are not looking at changing what we\u2019re doing with our business here and I guess the last point I would make on the wholesale funding is we would hope the rule is dynamic and does adjust as the industry adjusts to the new rule. ","The big point is that given what we\u2019ve done with our funding, with durability of our funding and the way we\u2019re managing our balance sheet we don\u2019t see it really at this point we are waiting for the rule, so I\u2019ll leave that caveat but really affecting the way we\u2019re running the business. ","Glenn Shorr - ISI ","Okay, last quickie is just your growth has been great in both -- as you noted in both the PLAs and the residential real estate loans. Are those FAs being -- especially incented to drive that. I know it comes at a higher profitability for the firm, does the low -- is the offset of the rates not going up for you guys low rates actually help drive the growth in those lending products?","Ruth Porat","There are a couple of different, I guess questions in that. As we\u2019ve talked about loan growth is not on the comp credit, on the formulaic comp credit, so we call non-compensable revenue. So there is compensation on it but it\u2019s not part of the formulaic grid and what\u2019s really driving this is we\u2019ve talked about on some prior calls is the take up, buy up and what we\u2019re finding is we\u2019re having growth in the loans per financial advisor, growth in the number of financial advisors using the product. As they use it they see the value of their clients, it\u2019s ease of using it, we\u2019ve invested meaningful in the infrastructure to support financial advisors and so they are seeing the strength of this product suite, and we\u2019re also seeing higher draw down on the security space lending, that loans so origination occurs and then you have to draw down over a period of time. So really what this is, is increased penetration on what is a very sizeable client base and that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving it. ","Glenn Shorr - ISI ","Okay excellent, I appreciate it. ","Ruth Porat","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Good morning. ","James P. Gorman"," ","Good morning. ","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","We\u2019ve heard a lot of complaints from investors who were worried about the Street reducing the liquidity that it provides, we heard a lot more about it in the last few weeks of the third quarter and at the same time in the third quarter the [GSICs] began to have to make daily reports to regulators based on more current liquidity regs, do you think this may have had an impact just because it\u2019s onerous and it kind of puts in your face every day the impact of inventory and hedging or is the issue more broadly structural on your view?","Ruth Porat","We think it\u2019s more structural and it\u2019s really the combination of other regulatory requirements. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s as a result of the Volcker reporting, people have been working on that for quite some time and as you said it now started to be submitted to regulators. But when you look at the combination of the supplementary leverage ratio with the other various tests, whether it\u2019s CCAR or for some firms it\u2019s the LCR, there are a number of factors which are really changing dynamics in the market liquidity in the market. At a recent conference I put up a slide that looks at the extent to which balance sheets have come down on the one hand and liquidity requirements have increased on the other hand and by definition that\u2019s squeezing the amount of balance sheet available for trading activities. So we do view that as a structural change in the industry driven by regulatory change in the aggregate. ","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","And is there a way that you\u2019re actually seeing in which this leads to fundamentally better spreads?","Ruth Porat","Well, the gaping that you saw this week, I would say I wouldn\u2019t view that as a positive for the market. I think that one of the things that has been concerning is the increase in treasury sales, which I think initially were attributed to the SLR and there was a view that potentially there would be a readjustment in markets but in fact through the course of the third quarter, even before the last couple of weeks the trend line was up even when market volatility was low and I think that is a concern.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","And actually, if don\u2019t mind can you comment a little bit on the early going in October. Obviously we are only a couple of weeks in and they have been an unusual couple of weeks but certainly JPMorgan commented earlier this week that their markets businesses had seemed a lot more mixed over the last couple of weeks?","Ruth Porat","Well as you said the macro environment, the trading markets are really the key issue and it has been a challenge quarter to-date but as you appropriately noted two weeks isn\u2019t a quarter and as I said in my opening comments we have seen this through the last several years, choppiness in markets and then a reset and it\u2019s tough to gauge when it resets. So it\u2019s been a choppy early start but when you look again across the franchise the investment banking pipeline is strong. ","You have seen continued issuance throughout this period and yes a sustained down draft wouldn\u2019t be constructive and it could affect the timing of deals but at this point the pipeline continues to build. In fact a lot of deals that we may have thought would close in the fourth quarter were pulled into the third quarter, were executed earlier and the pipeline has replenished which really goes to the strength of the dialog across the banking franchise. ","And similarly in wealth management what we are seeing, I appreciate you are asking about trading markets but as we look across our franchise what\u2019s quite relevant is just the consistency we\u2019re seeing in wealth management as well.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Thanks. You mentioned the SLR and thanks for giving us the figure, is there still a [Sacker] type benefit that we should be looking for?","Ruth Porat","Well, there has been no update on the rule. We do still expect that [Sacker] will be a part of the standardized risk based capital calculation and as proposed based on the third quarter number that would be about a 30 basis point benefit to our standardized ratio. On the SLR it\u2019s unclear if the rule would include [Sacker] as part of it, if it would include it we would expect a modest benefit there.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Thanks. I had a question on wealth management. As you pointed out the fee-based asset inflows at $6.5 billion were quite a bit lower than in either the reference quarters. I think you were $12.5 billion last quarter and $15 billion a year ago and I was wondering if there is any color you can provide there, any special factors that we should pay attention to?","Ruth Porat","No special factors. We have seen same strength in the business, it, in our view just reflects timing and as you noted we had strong flows throughout the year. So as we are looking at year-to-date we just had strong flows and there are timing issues.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Okay, and then I just have one more which is that you talked about the discrete tax benefit because of being able to repatriate more attractively than you had expected in terms of your tax provisions. How unusual an event is just the repatriation itself and can you give us a sense for the order of magnitude involved and I guess what I am looking for is a signal as to what we are looking at in terms of potential capital return?","Ruth Porat","So in terms of the repatriation as I noted it was due to some non-U.S. earnings that were at a cost lower than originally estimated, I think we look at requirements in geographic markets throughout the year, this one just happened to be with a benefit.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","And can you tell us sort of what the gross amount was that you repatriated?","Ruth Porat","We indicated the tax benefit. I don\u2019t have that with me.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Okay, fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Matt O\u2019Conner with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Conner - Deutsche Bank","","Good morning.","Ruth Porat","Good morning.","Matt O'Conner - Deutsche Bank","I was hoping just to follow-up on your comment about further capital actions given the strategic changes. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just referring to the CCAR process, earnings were higher, there has been more stability, so think about higher payouts or was there something else that you are referring to maybe related to selling the commodities business, bring up capital, things like that?","James P. Gorman","Why don\u2019t I take that? I think we\u2019re just pointing out that in the context of all the things going on at this time we are obviously building pretty solid capital buffers. That said we live in a dynamic regulatory environment with potentially new G-SIFI buffers coming out but we feel strongly about where we are with our capital base and we feel strongly about where we're going coming into the CCAR process. We certainly expect to continue to return capital to shareholders in increasing amounts over the coming years. ","Matt O'Conner - Deutsche Bank"," ","And then have you guys disclosed either the assets or revenue related to the commodities business, either what you sold or just the entire unit? ","Ruth Porat","No, we haven\u2019t. ","Matt O'Conner - Deutsche Bank"," ","Okay. And then just separately there was an article in the paper a couple of weeks ago related to the dividend arbitrage that some clients are using, that the US broker dealers and global broker dealers are helping. I am just wondering how big a business is that for you guys and remind us of the seasonality around that and thoughts on, I guess just the business going forward. ","Ruth Porat"," ","As we said repeatedly our equity business is strong, diversified across products and regions and that's what drives it. We don't break out particular pieces and there are seasonal patterns throughout the year.","Matt O'Conner - Deutsche Bank"," ","Okay, is that an area that you think you and others will pull back a little bit given just that it's being highlighted and maybe scrutinize a bit more than the past. ","Ruth Porat"," ","It is one of the number of services that we provide to clients and it's really based on client activity. ","Matt O'Conner - Deutsche Bank"," ","Okay. And then just lastly the non-comp, I mean expenses overall actually came in pretty good this quarter in general. The non-comp in particular has been managed down quite nicely. Is there anything, I guess from here or more that you could do or should we think about this as a pretty reasonable run rate?","Ruth Porat"," ","Our view is that there is more to do. We remain very focused on expenses overall and if you go back to 2012 when we first laid out our expense reduction goals we had an expense ratio at that time of about 84% and we indicated by the end of this year we\u2019d get to 79% or lower. Year-to-date we're at 77% but the process of going over the last couple of years is really to provide the analytics, the tools, the dashboards to the businesses to ensure that engrained throughout the organization is a real focus on expenses and expense management and we view that as an ongoing part of the way we run the business. ","As I talked about at a recent conference we divide our expenses into what we call run the bank and change the bank and we've been able to extract savings and run the bank to fund what we called change the bank requirements which include both regulatory requirements as well as ongoing innovation in the business, investments to ensure we're enhancing client experience and applications and across the platform. So again we got a very strict lens on that because it does create incremental capacity as well and we think it's the appropriate way to run the overall franchise. ","Matt O'Conner - Deutsche Bank"," ","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ruth Porat"," ","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James F. Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","Thanks. Can you just updates us on the FICC RWA this quarter and maybe just more strategically as we think outward if there is more pressure from regulators with the SIFI surcharge on top of a surcharge focused primarily on repo and other aspects of the fixed income business, do you think that that there could be some changes in trying to push the RWA lower overtime. Thanks.","Ruth Porat"," ","So risk weighted assets in fixed income are $191 billion this quarter, down from $192 billion last quarter. We just had less roll off this quarter and we remain very comfortable with the $180 billion target for fixed income which was originally end of 2016. We pulled it forward to end of 2015. ","As I indicated at a recent conference we want to make it clear though that there not -- just as with the non-comp expense question there is not a line in the sand on a particular date or activity stops beyond the $180 billion. There is about $25 billion incremental risk weighted assets that run off overtime in areas like structured credit and long dated and collateralized derivatives which generated a negative ROE because we have to finance positions, legacy positions and so as we exit we take those from a negative ROE to neutral and as we redeploy them you shift to a positive ROE and we're already generating strong ROEs in a number of business within fixed income like credit and securitized products and so we have an opportunity to reallocate to get a higher return on those and that's really the way we're looking at what we're doing within fixed income. ","As it relates to changing regulatory requirements and the potential surcharge, I would note that our ratios are very strong. The transitional ratio at 14.3% and even fully phased in as we\u2019re talking about, 11.7% standardized, 12.6% advanced. So what we\u2019re really looking at is how to best optimize within each business to drive the ROE within each business and we believe we\u2019ve got room to really use a number of different levers to do that. ","James F. Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","All right. So that\u2019s helpful, so if you think about the 180 there\u2019s 25, that\u2019s sort of run off beyond that but you might be re-investing depending upon the environment. Is that the way to think about it?","Ruth Porat","Yeah, depending on the environment and client activity because we have the opportunity already resident within a number of products, within fixed income to generate an attractive return. So depending on requirements there\u2019s ample capacity. ","James F. Mitchell - Buckingham Research ","Okay, great thanks. ","Ruth Porat","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi, what inning are you in, in redeploying the deposits that you achieved from the joint venture?","Ruth Porat","So we are -- what inning, you frequently do ask the inning question. I think we\u2019re well on our way, and I think, let me give a couple of parts to that. The early days, I guess you would say even pre-game was building the infrastructure required to support the growth when once we closed out the acquisition and started onboarding the deposits. And so that a very important element of really the setup, ensuring that we had the infrastructure, the risk management, the banker supporting, the financial advisors. So that as the deposits started onboarding we could have positive growth, a good experience for our financial advisors as I already addressed and see the kind of roll-out that we\u2019ve had. ","The other thing is we\u2019ve emphasized repeatedly that our focus is on prudent loan growth, prudent loan growth within wealth management and institutional securities and we have two broad franchises that enable us to have strong demand. But what we\u2019ve been focused on is really prudent loan growth and so we have ample capacity beyond here, we\u2019ve been closing the gap versus the industry average, but still believe we have ample capacity beyond here to grow and that is just with the contractual onboarding of deposits, where, as you\u2019ve seen this quarter there\u2019s organic on top of the contractual. ","So we view this as the opportunity to have the [inaudible] depository embedded within Morgan Stanley that creates substantial incremental opportunity in a flat rate environment or a rising rate environment and I\u2019ll give it to James because he tends to like cricket matches and they last a lot longer and that\u2019s the way we view this, this bank has got a long way to go. ","James P. Gorman","Well I'm not sure you\u2019re asking about cricket innings but if I were to put a number on it I\u2019d say we are somewhere around the bottom of the fourth in baseball and the afternoon tea session on day two of a five day test match. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","","Okay, how much do interest rates help if they increase and how much do they hurt if they don\u2019t increase. I mean some of the more traditional banking peers will actually quantify this for us and you guys haven\u2019t done that. Can you just help size the benefit or the harm?","Ruth Porat","Yes, I\u2019m glad you asked that question because it\u2019s an important one, given the way we see the outlook for the bank. So overall rising rates are a good thing. They do benefit the bank if we deploy deposits into lending and AFS. And second, it should signal an improving economy which would increase activity levels across the franchise. ","But the main point and I tried to indicate that in the opening comments is that the main driver of NII growth is deposit deployment and you can see that in our year-over-year numbers we\u2019re benefiting from deploying these legacies, city deposits and with more coming on board we have a positive impact even without rates rising. And so you take that -- that to us is really differentiated and managed, we\u2019re pleased to see the underlying growth in NII, again even without rates increasing. ","So now you put to the other side at some point rates will increase and for modeling a couple of key points. I guess the first is that the reason we\u2019ve gone through this the giving you contractual deposit on-boarding kind of what the schedule is and what the current asset mix and what the target asset mix is, is that you can model the rate impact whenever you do expect it to occur. ","The other component in modeling that we think about is one, what\u2019s the impact of higher rates on deposit outflows and the data suggests that for Morgan Stanley that would be de minimis because our deposits, our working capital and client accounts are very sticky. We\u2019ve talked about that in some prior calls. ","In terms of deposit pricing we model that based on historic data from both Morgan Stanley as well as for retail deposits at regional and large money center banks, notwithstanding the fact that as I just said our deposits do behave very differently than those retail deposits and our analysis in our model would reflect about a 45 basis points increase in deposit pricing with the first hundred basis points increase in rates. ","We do believe that is conservative given the nature of our deposits and structural changes in deposit alternatives. But it\u2019s what we would assume kind of as something to put into a model. Fed funds is the most relevant rate for our business and the last point is that the average duration of our bank assets is about 1.5 year. So rising rates do benefit us quickly. So the way we look at it is in the flat environment there\u2019s upside given NII growth but it\u2019s all about asset optimization in a rising rate environment given the factors I went through and the cost structure of our bank, no bricks and mortar, the investments have already been made, any rise in rates does drops nicely to the bottom line. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Just two quick follow-ups, the deposit data of 45% seem somewhat low compared to many traditional banks. Are you sure about that, I mean it\u2019s not a whole lot of sensitivity there?","Ruth Porat","When we look at the data that we\u2019ve looked at overtime and again given the nature of the deposits, as I indicated, our view is that that\u2019s appropriate given the nature of the business and as I said that we\u2019re talking about the first hundred basis points so it moves overtime. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And then low rates it stays lower for longer, what impact does that have on your refinancing of your debt. You issued a lot of debt when your credit spreads were blown out a few years ago and now they\u2019ve come in. Can you take advantage of that?","Ruth Porat","We can and we have because we\u2019ve started refinancing debt, as you noted, came on kind of came on in the 2010-\u201811 period. We do realize the benefit overtime given the weighted average maturity of our unsecured debt is about six years. So we would lag into any benefits overtime but at this point we\u2019re refinancing debt we issued post crisis and there\u2019s a benefit. ","Mike Mayo - CLSA","All right, thank you. ","Ruth Porat","Thank you. ","Operator","The next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Good morning. A quick one first, the $141 million gain that you laid out, was that only on that real estate sale or does it also include the gain on TransMontaigne?","Ruth Porat","That, no, it\u2019s just on the real estate. ","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay, can you -- is it possible to quantify the TransMontaigne gain, was that significant?","Ruth Porat","We don\u2019t break that up that\u2019s included within the other revenue line and just as a reminder that also includes the contribution from our joint venture with NUFG for the real estate at [inaudible] there is a number -- it\u2019s in the other line items in that one. ","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay, so I guess though given the fact that you broke it out would imply that you didn\u2019t view it as a material number and it wasn\u2019t material enough to break out, is that fair?","Ruth Porat","It\u2019s included, as I said within the other line. ","Brennan Hawken - UBS","All right, and then thinking about the rest of the physical business and the potential sale to Rosneft, what are the next steps if that doesn\u2019t go through here by year-end can you start to shop the asset now, is there any sort of change that can be made proactively on that front?","Ruth Porat","Well as you know and the way you framed the question the terms of the contract are such that if the deal doesn\u2019t close by year-end the contract expires and so we\u2019re considering alternatives if that doesn\u2019t close. ","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay, is it possible also, while on the physical commodity front to think about what growth rates might have been if we exclude either the TransMontaigne component of these physical commodities revenue out of FICC or physical commodities overall, just given that it\u2019s getting shopped?","Ruth Porat","So yeah, TransMontaigne would have been immaterial to the results, and as we indicated commodities overall was very low. It was down meaningfully year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. So it wasn\u2019t much of comp produced in across commodities generally. ","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay, so it is possible that the growth rate might have been higher if we ex out the physical business?","Ruth Porat","Yes. ","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Right, and then one last one, just when we talk about the loan book a lot of times we focus on the wealth management and I'm just kind of curious you disclosed that always half of the loan growth is going to be coming from the institutional side. How should we think about the NII from those loans flowing through your P&L and generally how should we think about the spreads on those loans versus the loans in your wealth management business. Is there a way to sort of frame how to think about that side of the loan growth?","Ruth Porat","Yes, it\u2019s a fair question because as you know in IS, in the institutional securities business NII is a function of a number of factors. So it\u2019s not as easy to parse through as in wealth management. Just to give you some loan growth numbers so in wealth management I think I indicated securities based-lendings up $2 billion, residentials up $1.5 billion and institutional securities we were up $1.5 billion on the quarter primarily in commercial real estate and we are focused continuing to build the diversified portfolio and our focus is on lending in areas where we have strong client franchise, strong domain knowledge. ","So the other element of it is it\u2019s enhancing our overall client experience within institutional securities. It\u2019s in addition to what we are already doing with key clients. And so it\u2019s reflected there as well and it\u2019s in our view accretive to the overall relationship. We have some slides that we have used in prior conferences that give you yields on a blended basis.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. And when we think about those yields and how that those yields play in my guess is or my sense should be that the level of competition in those markets is probably a bit more intense than you would see on the retail side. Is that a correct assumption or is that off base?","Ruth Porat","Well again as I said part of it is on both sides wealth management and institutional securities what we are doing is really focused on our client base and in institutional securities it\u2019s adding on to what we are doing within our key franchises. So that we view all of our businesses as competitive. We don\u2019t take anything we are doing with any of our clients for granted but we have got in our view a strong opportunity and what we said repeatedly is that we are focused on prudent loan growth. It\u2019s not as though we are looking to originate volume merely to originate volume. There is a substantial opportunity within our client base on both sides of the house and the key lens as you have probably heard us say too many types prudent loan growth and it\u2019s driven with the title funds on risk management and that\u2019s what\u2019s key to the way we are looking to build the Bank here.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay, thanks for the color, Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thanks a lot. Just on -- some of the regulatory ratios, any update on the bank SLR or the LCR?","Ruth Porat","So the bank, given we capitalize the bank to support the loan growth that I am pleased that we have been talking about a lot on this call, we are in a strong position on all the various capital ratios; LCR, SLR and again it\u2019s because we capitalize the bank to support what we expect will be ongoing loan growth.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then small items, but just in terms of the tax outlook and then also the CVA, just wanted to find out, significant this quarter or kind of an average level?","Ruth Porat","So in terms of the first part of your question, overtime given our business mix the tax rate should be around 30% and then on CVA it was positive this quarter. It was a drag last quarter and last year but one point that is worth noting is fixed income excluding commodities was up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and if you exclude CVA that same trend would apply. So the business fixed income products broadly excluding commodities up quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year excluding CVA.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then just on trading, so on commodities anything in the quarter that you would say was like a one-off versus environmental and that\u2019s more going into the fourth quarter and the next year and then I guess same thing on equities, just given the relative strength anything that you would say was especially strong that you wouldn\u2019t expect to continue?","Ruth Porat","No, so starting with commodities not -- nothing specific to call out and so our view is that what we are looking at appears to be structural headwinds in certain commodities markets and as a result the key question is how to best maximize returns if in fact these are structural headwinds. And but there was nothing specific there and similarly in equities we had broad-based strength again across products and geographies just given the leadership in that business. We did benefit from a strong global underwriting calendar but I would say that\u2019s kind of core to the overall franchise and the strength of what we are doing in equity underwriting generally and the equity underwriting calendar remains strong but nothing specific to call out as broad-based strength again.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Ruth Porat","I guess just to add one of the things to note is that we have seen in the past that challenging result in overall poor performance. You often see reallocation but overall I think that one of the key things is typically activity slows as you go into the end of the year in particular with prime brokerage clients we've seen that in prior years. ","Michael Carrier - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks. ","Operator","The next question will come from Fiona Swaffield with RBC.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC ","Hello. I just had two questions. Firstly was on just understanding the compensation ratio, sequentially a bit better because you took out the gain in your analysis on the pretax margins so I assume you should also do the same on the comp ratio and if we do that obviously has approved less, could you also explain this issue of the employee deferred comp and how that would affect the comp ratio sequentially? And the second question is on the SLR, could you talk a bit more about the balance sheet or the denominator, it obviously seems to have gone down which is helping and is there more prospect of that continuing. Thanks.","Ruth Porat","Certainly. So I am starting with the SLR 4.9% versus 4.6% last quarter. We had a contribution from both the numerator and denominator. The benefit on the denominator was actually primarily for mitigation of the gross up and so we've been talking for quite some time about the number of work streams against which we've been executing, including the net long CDS sold, the pickup in compression activities, the reductions in fixed income RWAs overtime and that was the bulk of the benefit that we saw on the denominator. ","As you noted we also had a decrease in our GAAP balance sheet but the other items were a contributor to the benefit from the denominator. And then on the numerator beyond earnings we did have a prep issuance this past quarter. Those two drove the numerator higher. In fact the split between the numerator and the denominator was about two-thirds of the benefit came from the numerator, one-third came from the denominator. ","Fiona Swaffield - RBC ","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse ","Thanks for taking my questions. Just quick one on FVA, a number of your peers have now implemented this adjustment to [inaudible] of these books, curious on your latest thoughts on where Morgan Stanley stands on this.","Ruth Porat ","So FVA referring obviously to fair value adjustments, refers to the potential implied financing cost for uncollateralized derivatives and only to the extent that those are observable, we do continue to evaluate it. As you noted there is a lot of industry discussion there has also been a lot of academic discussion on the topic but in our view transparency continues to be lacking so there is no basis to take the adjustments.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse ","Okay, and then quickly on VaR, that came down particularly interest rates, credit lines assume there was more connectivity during quarter, so just curious if you could parse out the decline debits we position in versus volatility.","Ruth Porat","It's come down, I think in line with overall, this activity level is coming down, we see it and you noted one line, I would say that in commodities it also came down so it was really just more in line with connectivity. ","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse ","Got it. Thank you.","Ruth Porat ","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question will come from Steven Chubak with Nomura. ","Steven Chubak - Nomura","Hi. Good morning. ","Ruth Porat ","Good morning.","Steven Chubak - Nomura ","James, I appreciate your comments on your CCAR focus internally and clearly you made considerable progress delivering stronger return over the last four quarters and one thing I was little bit surprised by just looking at your latest company run mid stress test is that your PPNR forecast of $8.3 billion was it meaningfully different than your prior company run submissions? And I was wondering this merely reflects increased conservatism on your part in an effort to maybe match the Feds historically conservative view of your PPNR profile and just given the progress that you've made over the last 12 months assuming no meaningful changes to the CCAR guidelines would you expect to see a better result this coming year? ","James P. Gorman","Why don't I just take the top line for a minute on the better results this year? We didn't ask something that we didn't get last year so it's not like we have been restrictive, we have behaved according to what we thought was the right balance for the business and the right balance for capital action. So yes as we are accreting earnings which we have been doing throughout this year significantly and we\u2019ve made the capital ratios which we expect to meet and we\u2019re entering the CCAR process with a reasonably high degree of confidence again I think it has six goals around -- we would expect to have further action on the capital side. ","So it\u2019s not like we asked for something didn\u2019t get it last year, we\u2019re just proceeding on a plan that we\u2019ve been on for several years. ","Steven Chubak - Nomura","No, I certainly wasn\u2019t suggesting that it\u2019s more focus on the, I guess your perception of the PPNR in the - progress that you made and it\u2019s probably the one area where as I\u2019ve -- one clear argue that the fed has been overly conservative, at least certainly that we\u2019ve heard from other market participants as well. ","James P. Gorman","That\u2019s a fair comment and I think I\u2019ll let Ruth take you through how we think about it this year?","Ruth Porat","So we would agree it\u2019s obviously premature to comment on 2015 CCAR since we haven\u2019t seen the royalty that we would agree. We think the PPNR calculation was very counterintuitive, last year and our view is that another year of evidence, the benefit of the change in the business mix logically should help in last year it was the completion of the most strategic transformation of the acquisition of final piece of the wealth management business and you\u2019ve seen we substantially increase the quality and consistency of earnings with the acquisition. ","So our view is that this is an iterative process that improves all parties have improvements throughout the course of time and it was counter intuitive and we\u2019re working hard to highlight all that we\u2019ve done and the benefit of the earnings stream and so again that\u2019s been the key focus you\u2019ve identified we did think it was counterintuitive. ","Steven Chubak - Nomura","No thanks, that commentary is extremely helpful and then just switching over this one quick question on preferreds. You issued the additional billion as you noted in the quarter. It appears that you\u2019re at least fast approaching the 150 basis points of RWA target, others have contemplated, as has been mentioned by Basel, I'm just wondering at this juncture do you feel as though you\u2019re full on preferreds at the moment or should we anticipate additional issuance going forward?","Ruth Porat","We have no plans for more preferred issuance this year. Over the past few years we\u2019ve been optimized on capital stack as you said, but prospectively I'm not going to close the door prominently but at this point no plans for preferred issuance this year. ","Steven Chubak - Nomura","No, I understood. Okay, thank you for taking my questions. ","James P. Gorman","Thank you.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. We will again review the progress we\u2019ve made towards the six strategic priorities we delineated in January that will drive our return on equity and return on tangible equity, excluding DVA to greater than 10% and 12% respectively.","We\u2019re pleased with the progress we made during the quarter and we met or exceeded several of the goals. Let me just go through them quickly. First was to acquire 100% of the Wealth Management joint venture. As you know we closed on the final 35% of that joint venture on the last business day of the quarter. As we\u2019ve taken you through the benefits numerous times, I\u2019m not going to spell them out again. Suffice it to say however the deal was a game changer for this firm and for our shareholders, now and for decades to come.","Secondly, we put out a goal to achieve Wealth Management margins through expense management and through revenue growth. In addition to owning 100% of the business, one of the key drivers for our way upside is the revenue and margin upside in the Wealth Management business. Both were higher this quarter. The margin of 18.5% represented the fifth consecutive quarter of margin improvement, excluding non-recurring costs associated with the integration in Q3 2012.","We reached our highest margin level since the first quarter of 2008. In addition, we increased our margin goals for the Wealth Management business at our financials conference in June to 20% to 22% by the end of 2015 without the benefit of high rates of markets and more than 23% if markets or rates increase. Why the increase? The margins reflect the simple math of the upside from 100% with ongoing investment in the business, using the first quarter of 2013 results as a base.","Our third objective was to significantly reduce RWAs in fixed income and commodities. We continued to make progress regarding our fixed income RWA reductions, ending the quarter at $239 billion, down from the first quarter. We continue to expect fixed income RWAs to be below $200 billion by the end of 2016.","Our fourth goal was to drive expenses lower in 2013, 2014 and beyond. We\u2019re on track to meet our expense reduction targets and Ruth will take you through this in more detail. As you can clearly see, our expense ratios have improved as we said they would with revenue growth.","Our fifth point was to grow earnings through Morgan Stanley\u2019s specific opportunities. We recently received approximately $16 billion of deposits in the initial wave due to us now that we\u2019 own 100% of Wealth Management. The team is executing against our plan to prudently deploy those deposits in support of loan growth in both institutional securities and wealth management. Now that we own 100%, we can execute on more of the initiatives we have in place to better align institutional and wealth management, including a deeper partnership between the businesses and their trading days. Because order flows no longer split with our former partner, we expect deeper and more efficient markets to both our institutional and retail clients, as well as greater revenue opportunity for fixed income, in addition to the order flow benefit we discussed [with you] for Wealth Management. We\u2019re also looking forward to launching new products and increasing the efficiency of firm funding.","So our sixth point asked, what did it all add up to? Well, despite difficult markets, our results this quarter evidenced strength and resilience. Revenues in all of our major businesses were up double digits year over year, with Institutional Securities excluding DVA, up 40% and Investment Management up 48%. In addition, we\u2019re pleased to commence the share repurchase we announced this morning, which will offset some of the dilution relating to employee stock programs and also benefit ROE. We recently received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve to return 1% of our tier-1 capital and will execute on the buyback in the forthcoming quarters.","We\u2019ve been on a long journey to generate stronger, more sustainable, long term returns with businesses that balance each other in volatile markets. With the acquisition of 100% of Wealth Management, that business model is solidly in place. Our Wealth Management business complements our leading institutional securities business and the adjacencies across the entire platform will drive upside for all of Morgan Stanley. We have strength across areas of fixed income and are consistently in the top three in equity underwriting and M&A lead tables with increasing momentum in fixed income underwriting. Our investment banking franchise is a leader globally and we demonstrated the power of our footprint with important cross-border deal announcements in the quarter.","I would now like to draw particular attention to our institutional equities franchise which consistently ranks top two globally in market and wallet share. In the second quarter we continued to execute extremely well against challenging markets. In the cash product we benefitted from the hybrid voice and electronic model centered around integrated client coverage. We approached this business with the delivery of research driven content, market insight, and state of the art trading technology to a wide variety of client types. Our electronic offering spends cash, synthetic cash and derivatives, and has more than doubled market share over the last three years.","In equity derivates, our team is capitalizing on the investments we have made over the last several years driven by the breadth of our client reach, deepening relationships and partnerships across the firm, and ongoing strong risk management. And last but not least, in prime brokerage with significant balances we have a practice focused on market access, service excellence and innovative solutions for clients, all leading to an outstanding performance by institutional equities this quarter.","With Morgan Stanley's global reach, we are confident there is continued upside for this business and for the firm.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Ruth and look forward to your questions later on.","Ruth Porat","Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effective DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures. The impact of DVA in the quarter was $175 million with $114 million in equity sales and trading and $61 million in fixed-income sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm wide revenues were $8.3 billion, down approximately 2% versus the first quarter. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the second quarter was 31%.","Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholder, excluding DVA, were approximately $720 million which included a negative adjustment of $152 million related to the acquisition of the remaining 35% stake in the wealth management joint venture. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share excluding DVA was $0.37 after preferred dividends. EPS included a negative adjustment of $0.08 per share from the acquisition of the remainder of the wealth management joint venture.","On a GAAP basis, including the impact of DVA, firm wide revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $831 million. Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share also inclusive of the negative adjustment of $0.08, were $0.43 per share after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was $31.48 per share, tangible book value was $26.27 per share reflecting a reduction of $1.49 due to the completion of the acquisition of the wealth management joint venture partially offset by earnings.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our total assets were $806 billion at June 30, essentially flat versus last quarter. Deposits were $82 billion, basically unchanged from the prior quarter. Quarter end deposits did not reflect the first tranche of deposits that are transferred to Morgan Stanley in conjunction with the acquisition of the remainder of the joint venture. The initial deposits come in on a lag basis with $16 billion transferred this week. We will receive the remaining deposits on a monthly basis through the middle of 2015.","Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $181 billion compared with $186 billion at the end of the first quarter. The decline was driven by a reduction in bank liquidity as we deployed excess liquidity to support loan growth. Although our calculations are not final, we believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel 1 will be approximately 11.8%, and our Tier 1 capital ratio will be approximately 14.1%. Risk-weighted assets under Basel 1 and including the final marker risk rules are expected to be approximately $404 billion at June 30.","Reflecting our best assessment and expectations of the recently received Federal Reserve rules, our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was 9.9% as of the end of the second quarter. We know that this ratio reflects our best interpretation at this time and it's subject to change as we further study the new rules. We estimate our pro-forma supplementary leverage ratio to be 4.2%. This estimate reflects the most recent United States proposed regulatory rules for the numerator and the denominator and is also subject to change as we study the guidelines. We have a clearly identified path to exceed in 2015 to 5% regulatory requirements.","Turning to expenses, total expenses this quarter were $6.7 billion, up 2% versus the first quarter, with compensation expense down 3% and non-compensation expense up 11%. Relative to the expense reduction targets that we articulated in January, we remain on track as best evidenced by our expense ratios relative to our 2014 target. Recall that we expected that some of our expense reduction effort to result in $1.6 billion decline from 2012 reported expenses to 2014 full year expenses. Our $1.6 billion target was set based on revenue consistent with 2012 levels, notwithstanding our expectations for growth. Thus we further indicated that on higher revenues our variable expenses would grow, but the overall expense ratio would improve.","Our revenues excluding DVA were up 8% in the first half while expenses were up 5%. Excluding higher litigation costs, our expenses would have been up 2%. Our $1.6 billion cost reduction target on flat revenues implied an expense ratio of approximately 79% for the firm for 2014. We are at that level in the first half of 2013 and would be even better than 79% without higher litigation, with still more expense savings to be realized over time. As a reminder our target for two year target and expenses have and will likely continue to vary from quarter-to-quarter. Recall that we had some non-recurring expenses in the second half of last year.","In addition, we had severance and certain wealth management items in our result in the first half of this year. Our targets include an expectation for continued elevated legal expenses, but of course those tend to be lofty and difficult to forecast. We continue to work through our cost cutting programs and they will drive operating leverage through the end of 2014.","Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, revenue excluding DDA were $4.2 billion down 5% sequentially. Non-interest expense was $3.4 billion, up 3% versus the first quarter. Compensation was $1.8 billion for the second quarter, down 7% versus the first quarter, reflecting a 42% ratio excluding DDA. Non-compensation expense of $1.6 billion increased 16% from last quarter, driven by increased litigation expense as well as revenue and activity related costs. The business reported a pretax profit of 4785 million, excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact of DVA, the business reported a pretax profit of $960 million.","In investment banking, revenues of $1.1 billion were up 14% versus last quarter, with strong growth in EMEA. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked number two in global completed M&A, number three in announced M&A, number two in global IPOs and number three in global equity at the end of the second quarter.","Notable transactions included, in advisory, Morgan Stanley acted as lead financial advisor to Kabel Deutschland on the proposed \u20ac10.7 billion takeover offer from Vodafone. In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley successfully priced the $4 billion IPO of Suntory Beverage & Food Limited. Morgan Stanley acted as joint global coordinator and [lead left] book runner on the international tranche. Our JV partner MUFG also acted as joint book runner on the domestic tranche. And in debt underwriting Morgan Stanley acted as an active book runner on Petrobras Jumbo $11 billion fixed tranche senior notes offering as well as Chevron\u2019s $6 billion four tranche senior notes offering.","Advisory revenues of $333 million were up 33% versus our first quarter results, driven by cross border activity and improved performance in EMEA and the Americas. Equity underwriting revenues were $327 million, up 16% versus the first quarter, driven by a significant increase in IPO activity and the highest level of sponsor related activity in several years. We had strength in the Americas and Asia, particularly Japan. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $418 million, up 2% versus a strong first quarter driven by loan syndication fees.","Equity sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were $1.8 billion, an increase of 13% from last quarter. Equity revenues were up broadly across products, regions and client segments versus the first quarter. Client revenues were the highest level in over a year driven by higher market volumes, increased volatility and greater prime brokerage balances. In cash equities, the revenue increase was driven by continued strong market share and volume growth, in particular in the Americas. Derivatives revenues were up versus last quarter with strength across regions particularly in Japan and the Americas and in part driven by higher volatility. Prime brokerage revenues also increased driven by increased activity during the European dividend season and higher client balances which increased with overall market levels.","Fixed income and commodities sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were $1.2 billion. Fixed income revenues decreased versus the first quarter due to higher volatility that resulted in lower client activity. However, a reduction in our risk levels during this period helped offset price volatility. FX delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of revenue gains benefiting from ongoing strong contribution from the firm's electronic trading platform. Commodities results were up meaningfully versus the first quarter benefiting in particular from increased client activity in North American power and natural gas as well as precious metals volatility.","Generally, however, the oil liquids market which overtime has been the most important driver of our commodities business, continues to operate at historically low levels. Finally, there was a modest CVA benefit in the quarter. Other sales and trading negative revenues of $57 million compared with positive revenues of $73 million last quarter. Average trading VAR for the second quarter was $61 million versus $72 million in the first quarter driven by a reduction in risk in May in fixed income and commodities.","Turning to wealth management. We achieved revenues of $3.5 billion in the second quarter, a record level. Asset management revenues of $1.9 billion were consistent with the first quarter, benefiting from higher market levels that were offset by lower deposit referral fees due to a rate reset late in the first quarter. Transaction revenues decreased 7% from last quarter consisting primarily of commissions of $567 million which were flat to the prior quarter.","Investment banking related fees of $258 million, down 6% versus last quarter, reflecting lower new issue volumes. And trading revenues of $223 million which were down 25% versus the first quarter, reflecting the impact of lower activity due to difficult market conditions in June. Net interest revenue increased 8% to $446 million driven primarily by growth in our lending product. Other revenue increased to $139 million in the quarter, primarily due to a gain on the sale of our global stock plan business and our investment portfolio gains.","Non-interest expense was $2.9 billion, flat to last quarter. The compensation ratio was 58% versus 60% in the first quarter, reflecting a higher level of net interest income and higher non-compensable revenues in the other revenue line. Non-compensation expense was $834 million up 3% versus last quarter due to a number of expense items incurred in conjunction with the closing of the wealth management joint venture, including software write offs, branch consolidation and increased advertising expenses. The PBT margin was 18.5%. Profit before tax and the PBT margin benefited modestly from the net impact of the unusual revenue expenses in the quarter. Profit before tax was $655 million, the highest level of absolute profitability since the inception of the joint venture.","We reported non-controlling interest of $100 million in the quarter, reflecting a full quarter of earnings. Prospectively we will not have the NCI deduction.","Total client assets were basically flat to 1Q at $1.8 trillion. Global fee based asset inflows were $10 billion. Fee based assets under management increased to $629 billion at quarter end. Global representatives were 16,321 up slightly from the first quarter. Bank deposits were 127 billion effectively flat to 1Q. Approximately $70 billion were held in Morgan Stanly Bank. As mentioned previously, we received the first wave of deposits associated with the final 35% ownership this week.","Investment management revenues of $673 million were up 4% versus the first quarter. In traditional asset management, revenues of $419 million were up from the first quarter, driven by higher performance fees and asset management and administration fees. In real estate investing revenues decreased 11% versus the first quarter when the firm realized strong, principal investment gains. Due to the ownership structure of these funds, the majority of these revenues are passed to third-party Investors in the non-controlling interest line. In merchant banking, revenues were up 31% compared to the first quarter driven by higher principal investment gains.","Expenses were $513 million, up 12% from the first quarter, reflecting a change in revenue mix. Profit before tax was $160 million, down 14% sequentially. NCI was 421 million versus $51 million last quarter. Total assets under management increased to $347 billion driven net inflows of $9.8 billion.","In terms of our outlook, in the U.S, positive economic data suggests that headwinds are abating. Improving employment, signs of strength and discretionary consumer spending, a healthy outlook for housing and a declining deficit are encouraging signs for our clients and our businesses. Recent Federal Reserve guidance is also constructive, in particular its emphasis on interest rate policy. Institutional clients are repositioning in response to the Fed comments. Equity activity in the U.S. remains strong with U.S. Equity viewed as a relative safe heaven. Our M&A pipeline remains healthy with corporate clients increasingly focused on executing strategic priorities ahead of potential rising rates. And our retail clients remain engaged in the markets.","In the Eurozone our outlook for GDP remains subdued. We expect to see higher activity levels, but only relative to anemic lows in recent periods. Japanese markets remained strong and we are well positioned to give partnership with MUFG. In short we benefit from our leading positions globally, our franchise momentum continues and we are increasingly leveraging strengths within business unit to the benefit of the entire firm.","Thank you for joining us and James and I will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). The first question will come from Mike Carrier with Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe first question just on the wealth management business, so you\u2019re hitting the margins, you do the buy in. The one area that it just seems like for that business it still looks little bit on the lower side would just be on the returns and grant this quarter. There is a lot of charges and you don't get the full benefit. But it just seems like even on an adjusted basis, it might be in that 7% to 8%. Just going forward, what's the driver there of improving those returns? Obviously as the margins pick up, that's going to benefit it. But just what's the long-term opportunity for the return in the Wealth Management business?","Ruth Porat ","Well a couple of points, given there was an acquisition, there is goodwill associated with it. So the return on tangible equity in the business is about 30% today. And we do see the profitability, the profit margin and the returns on that business increasing. So up nicely year-over-year increased versus the last quarter and really reflects the ongoing strength on the revenue line, the benefit as the cost moves that we\u2019ve made on expense line. I did call out that there were some higher expenses this quarter, but fundamentally the benefit on the expense line. And we do see longer term upside as we continue to execute on the lending products. So again upside from lending. We revised our target to 20%-22% by the end of 2015. And again to be clear, that was with no assumption about higher equity market levels or rate changes and we expect that we would be above 23% with the benefits of market and rates.","The other thing I would note is that this quarter we did take the charge associated with buying in the balance of the wealth management business. That's $152 million charge, so the return on equity excluding that 10%, but again I would focus you to the return on tangible equity given the acquisition.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just as a follow up on the capital side. So you gave the color on the leverage, you know ratio and the outlook in terms of 2015. In terms of -- how do you get there? What are the different leverage points that you have? And then any impact on the revenues of the business. And the probably more importantly, given that you have got the buybacks this quarter and for the rest of the year, how do you think that plays in? Because obviously their earnings power is improving, the leverage ratio is lower, but you are getting some buyback opportunity. So when you think about buybacks going into '14 and '15, any view on that just given the different dynamics. Thanks.","Ruth Porat","Sure. So let me start with the leverage ratios. I indicated we estimate we are spot at about 4.2% this quarter and as I said we expect to be above 15% in 2015. We do see opportunities with both the numerator and the denominator, and most important they are very consistent with the strategy against which we have been executing. So starting with the denominator where we see a big opportunity, there are a couple of things to note. First, with our focus on reducing risk-weighted assets in fixed income, this is not model approval but passive and active mitigation and as a result we are taking balance sheet down because there is a relationship between risk-weighted assets and gross balance sheet. So that\u2019s the first point. And as we repeatedly said, we are taking risk-weighted assets down in areas that are not accretive to revenues. So we don\u2019t see that as impacting the business.","The second is our focus on central clearing. We have talked about that on many calls. We have invested meaningfully in central clearing. We are well positioned to increase the volume of our derivatives through central clearing and back-loading old trades leads to an elimination of the gross up in the denominator. We are obviously accreting capital which benefits the numerator. So when you incorporate those items, 500 million share repurchase we talked about and then assumption that we do continue to return capital on the future, that takes us to this glide path to above 5% in 2015.","Now to be clear, on top of those items we do believe there are additional opportunities to reduce the denominator but it's too early to quantify. A couple of examples. With banks on both sides of the Atlantic focused on reducing balance sheet, we believe there could be lower derivatives notionals by compressing offsetting trades between clients and counterparties for non-clearable derivatives. A second opportunity is more upside in central clearing. In our calculation, we only incorporated our expectation for the amount to be cleared in the next 12 months. We didn't go beyond one year. This is an important area and so we do see, again, upside in the reduction in the denominator from the amount that's centrally cleared.","And then finally, consistent with all that we have been doing to optimize capital, business unit leaders have the analytics to optimize the returns, we have talked about this in the past. We charge them for the capital balance sheet and liquidity needed to support their business. And when you look at the way we are organized with our bank resource management effort, we've talked about that in the past, BRM. It's a centralized resource governance structure. We are well positioned to make appropriate resource allocation adjustments. So we do feel good about the strength of our capital base. We have baked in returning more capital into that calculation and I would note that we are already above 6% at the bank.","Operator","The next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Very encouraging to see the buyback. Can we assume that, that was something that was approved as part of your approvals process with Fed just ahead of the joint venture buy-in?","Ruth Porat","So, just to break it down, in the 2013 CCAR, the only request we put in, as we've talked about on prior calls, was for the wealth management acquisitions given how strategically important that is. And there is a provision though within CCAR, once you have capital approval you can apply for an additional 1% of tier 1 capital for capital action. So upon closing it, I think this is where you are going, but just to make sure I\u2019m very clear on it, as we went to the final closing of the wealth Management acquisition, we put in the request to use this incremental 1% of tier-1 capital for capital actions. We thought it was the logical next step and are pleased to have the approval, no objection and to be commencing the share repurchase. It hasn't yet started. We just got approval for it, so it gives the ability to use it as James said in his opening comments.","James Gorman","I think, Guy, that the key first I'd say consistently is to focus on the strategic platform, get Morgan Stanley in the shape that it needs to be in for the next decade and more. And then the financial management through buybacks and other capital actions obviously follow from that. So were very careful to make sure we got the deal done even though it was a modest capital outlay of $400 and some million before started anything on the capital action. And we\u2019ve taken this first step and obviously we\u2019re pleased to do it.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","But just to follow up on it then, as we think about the platform and the capital that's needed in it, I look at the capital allocations that you give for the different business unit, which is as I told before a very, very helpful disclosure which a lot of people don't do. So thanks for that. I noticed that you brought the capital in ISG down this quarter by a little over $1 billion. And with the accumulation of retained earnings you brought the parent unallocated capital up by a little over 2 billion. Are we supposed to read or can we read anything into that and to what you think you need for the different business platforms and how much you might be accumulating for ultimate return?","Ruth Porat","Let me first clarify what's in the allocation of required capital. So you\u2019re absolutely right, the parent capital number went up. The allocation is based on the final Basel I, Basel 1 plus 2.5 if you want to call it that. And with the reduction in risk weighted assets and fixed income that we require less capital in fixed income, which is why the ISG number went down and the parent number went up, accretion of earnings plus the reduction of capital required in the business. Now the way we are managing the business is with the Basel III lens as we\u2019ve talked about and we will shift this table to Basel III as soon we are -- the industry is reporting on the Basel III basis completely. But fundamentally, what you see here is that we are continuing to accrete capital. That's why we said we believe we are increasing our degrees of flexibility that's reflected in our Basel III tier-1 common ratio and in particular the clarity we think we have with the execution path on the leverage ratio. So directionally, yes, and then the numbers have changed a little as we move to Basel III.","Operator","The next question will come from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Credit Suisse","Congratulations on the buyback and results. On the core client fixed franchises, it's been a challenging backdrop, but I think you've expressed some level of disappointment on absolute basis, and the results somewhat like it appears. As you looked at broader fixed franchise performance, what do you attribute under performance to? And what's within your control from here to improve those results and the trajectory of it?","Ruth Porat","Well, it was a tough quarter. We reduced risk in May given our concerns about the potential market volatility within fixed income products. You can see that. When you look at VAR, we ended the quarter with VAR down about 15%. And as I noted risk weighted assets were down, down to $239 billion. In our view it does set us up well going forward to support higher client activity. And we do -- I think that we have upside in quite a number of the products areas. And we\u2019re continuing to benefit from the leadership positions across our franchise given the benefit of adjacencies.","James Gorman","I would just add how there is a little bit of an obsession comparing for size. We don't frankly compare for size. We have a different structure business from a lot of other institutions for very important reasons. We\u2019re not a global commercial bank in the traditional sense. So we\u2019re always going to have smaller foreign exchange and rates businesses. But we focus on our returns. We\u2019ve been through a period where we had to clean up a lot of stuff that we had. We did that going back to MBIA and longer. We had to then build out our flow footprint which we\u2019ve been doing over the last couple of years. And now the business is aligned the way we like it. We\u2019re now working on each of those paths as we laid out at the last analyst call getting to their individual returns. The sum aggregate obviously gives us a decent return for the business. So, we\u2019re much more focused on returns that on size.","Howard Chen - Credit Suisse","Understood, thanks. And then switching gears over to GWM. Ruth, asset administration fees grew but may be not as much as we expected with the lag pricing dynamic. So, I was just hoping you could walk through the dynamics of the moving parts of the referral fees this quarter? And any other notable trends ex the referral fees that you might have seen through the business?","Ruth Porat","Well, you went right to the key point which was the referral fees. That referral fee is set on an annual basis and it's based on rates at the time. It was reset late in the first quarter. So this is the first full quarter of the lower deposit referral fees. It gets reset again next year. And the deposit referral fee, just like the higher FDIC fee as well, both of those roll off as the deposits roll over to Morgan Stanley.","Howard Chen - Credit Suisse","And then my final question, thanks for all the thoughts on the supplemental leverage ratio, just, if I heard you correctly, it sounds, Ruth, like most of the mitigating actions you could take are mostly on fixed income. And I guess when I take a step back, I inherently think of yourselves in trading franchise, equity is being inherently more levered business than fix. So how do we kind of marry that with you having fantastic equities results with that inherently being a higher leverage business with you achieving the glide path, if that makes sense? Thanks.","Ruth Porat","So a couple of things. One, we are managing a leverage-based capital -- looking at both leverage-based capital and risk-based capital and a portfolio actually, when you manage those two, results in the highest overall return. Second, on the gross up. In terms of the gross up for the balance sheet, the areas that we're running down are areas entirely consistent, as I said, with the strategy we're executing upon. So back to James' comment that we are not focused on fixed income size for size's sake, we are looking at the returns on the business. And so the run down in risk-weighted assets enables us to focus on the areas that are core to our client franchise where we are continuing to put risk behind clients and the reduction in denominator associated with the move to central clearing. Again, we have repeatedly said on calls that we believe that central clearing is not only good for the market because it increases transparency and standardization, but it does play to Morgan Stanley's strength because it's less about competing on size of the balance sheet and more about content and service and execution. So we were moving in that direction in any event and the opportunity to back load old trades in the central clearing and thereby reduce the denominator, again, consistent with our ability to have a right, a focused, fixed income business that plays to our strength and again benefits from all that we are doing across the franchise.","Howard Chen - Credit Suisse","Okay. Maybe just one follow-up on that. I guess what I am asking is, it doesn't sound like there is a high level of concern that this supplemental leverage ratio and mitigating to that will disrupt these great results, share gains that you have all made in the equities business over the last few years?","Ruth Porat","I know as I said, I think what the elegance of the rundown to 2014, if that's the right word to use, is it is consistent with the strategy that we have already articulated and against which we're executing. And our equities franchise is a stellar franchise, continued strength across products and geographies, balanced across the franchise and so again able to continue to execute.","Operator","The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA","I just wanted to clarify, Ruth, when you said getting the leverage ratio of 5% that has an assumption for return of capital in the future. What did you mean by that?","Ruth Porat","We included an assumption but I don't want to prejudge where 2014 CCAR comes out, and given flexibility that we have as I enumerated the various other items to further reduce denominator. We have built in levels of flexibility so that again it will be based on where CCAR is at the end of this year and managing the mix of levers that we have. But I noted it because 500 million is a good first step in terms of a share repurchase and it is a tool that we believe we've built flexibility to use on a go forward basis, but don't want to prejudge 2014 CCAR by putting a number out there.","James Gorman","I would just point out though, since the last CCAR we have had earnings of 800, round numbers, 800 of [BM2] and 900. So we are obviously accreting reasonably healthy levels of capital quarter-by-quarter.","Michael Mayo - CLSA","Still on the topic of capital, the ROE is about half of where your target is. Any general thoughts on how you\u2019re going to improve the ROE from where it is in this quarter?","Ruth Porat","Yeah. So James laid out in January the six point ROE plan and as he said we've already made progress, substantial progress on a number of the items. Completing the Wealth Management acquisition obviously a key step. The earnings this quarter don't have to benefit of that incremental 35% we closed on the last day of the quarter. That starts July 1. The revenue and margin upside, we've delivered, but as we indicated we think there is more upside there. The reduction in risk weighted assets in fixed income, we\u2019re very much on track, if not ahead of track and we do believe that there is upside in that business. We're continuing to execute on the wealth management -- sorry, on the expense ratios.","And expenses were a bit higher this quarter as we noted. Litigation was a bit higher and again we're on a good trajectory to have tighter expense ratios as we go through to 2014. We\u2019re executing on our on the bank strategy which again gives us some upside and capital as well. So the ROE this quarter was obviously also depressed by the charge associated with buying in the Wealth Management business. But when you roll those items together, excluding the charge about 6% and then we see upside from the six items that we've consistently taken you back to.","James Gorman","Mike, I'd just say there is nothing that we have seen in this quarter that changes our view on what we laid out on our ROE projections. We stand by them.","Michael Mayo - CLSA","And you mentioned backlogs a little bit, but could you elaborate a little bit more?","Ruth Porat","Sure. The pipeline does remain healthy. U.S. Activities is strong as I did note. Europe is up, but that's versus a very week prior 12 months. Japan continues to be strong. Emerging markets are mixed. China is slow. Brazil has a big pipeline, but as challenged. We think that's on pause at least for now. But we\u2019re seeing greater opportunity in Asia Pacific. So it's very country specific. I think the intriguing element is this backlog in M&A which has been sitting for quite some time and I\u2019ve said on prior calls we attribute that to CEO confidence. But what we are increasingly hearing is reassessments of timing, in particular as Fed comments are that any moves are data dependent. Where there are signs of improvements in the economy, that isn't inspiring, in conjunction with concern about higher rates and what that means is if there is a delay. So we are hopeful to see that backlog start moving through the execution. The drivers today on activity have been more cross-border as I noted in the sponsor and activist related activity. The equity pipeline is stable. It\u2019s skewed more towards the U.S., Mexico and Japan.","Michael Mayo - CLSA","And two more smaller ones. Litigation, how much was it this quarter and where do you expect that to go and what's normal?","Ruth Porat","So the second quarter was up a 140 relative to the first quarter. It's proven to be an ongoing cost for the industry associated with all the pre-crisis matters. It's proven to be lumpy, tough to forecast. But we called it out in terms of the expense comparison, because at some point the financial crisis is behind the industry and these start to abate. And just to give a sense, first half this year versus first half last year we were up $250 million.","Michael Mayo - CLSA","And then lastly your VAR was down, at some others, it was up. What is that? Is that just a more cautious risk profile or is this just temporary?","Ruth Porat","The VAR was down in particular on the interest rate and credit line. And that really goes to my comments that we reduced risk in May given concerns about potential market volatility within fixed income products. And I think the team did a good job managing that, but it does set us up well to put to support client activity this quarter going forward. We have capacity there.","Operator","The next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","So a quick one on leverage. Does the new rule change your view on moving derivatives over to the bank sub?","Ruth Porat","That's a great question because I indicated that we\u2019re above 6% at the bank now. And the way we are looking at it, it's obviously just come out and it's still in the proposal stage. But if we move derivative to the bank, we get a dollar for dollar benefit because we\u2019re not obviously funding them with unsecured any more, but with deposits. So there is some optimization there. And I think the way we are thinking about it is client preference, efficiency, logic of it, how the market is evolving, we have some capacity in the bank that we have a clear flight path for the holding company. So it's much more about looking at the specific asset classes and assessing it and it's too early to actually answer it more specifically than that.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","That's fair. So, switching gears then, I guess as you guys continue to work to improve margins in wealth management, is there a way we should think about FA headcount going forward?","Ruth Porat","Well, FA headcount is up a bit this quarter. We continue to be very focused on FA productivity which as I noted is at a record high. And kind of in and around this level is logical and again our focus is primarily on FA productivity. So it's not a line in the sand here.","James Gorman","It will bounce around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. Honestly, I wouldn't think about it too much.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","But really productivity is probably the bigger driver in the way that we should think about it more so than actually the number it has?","Ruth Porat","Yes.","James Gorman","By far.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Great. And then last one from me. As NII becomes sort of more important to you all and the asset leverage increases paying a lot more attention to that, and so this question is a little dated, but I kind of not pay as much attention to [NII] guys for a while. It seems as though NII and ISG has been really weak since 2008. What's been behind that? Is there any way to think about that or what are the drivers there?","Ruth Porat","No, I think your opening comments actually answered it. NIM is much more a banking book than a trading book concept and so it's much more relevant for the wealth management business and it has been improving nicely and should continue to as we deploy deposits. So really it's less relevant in the trading business.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. And on the [latter] business, the wealth management business, we have seen kind of a move here in the two and three year treasury. Is there any benefit that we can expect down the line for you guys from that move or is the deposit investment for shorter and only really like the six months LIBOR would have an impact?","Ruth Porat","Yeah, we've indicated that it really is -- we focus on the much shorter end. So the first 150 basis points in Fed funds is about $1.1 billion in PBT for the business. To the extent we're seeing rising rates because there is improving economic activity, that's constructive for all of the businesses but the guidance that we provided was really anchored at the short-end.","Operator","The next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Could I just ask a follow up question on the derivatives business as you move to central clearing. We talk a lot about the numerator benefit, but have you done any work trying to figure out what the, if any, capital benefit would be on a Basel III basis and going to moving more and more of the derivatives to centralized clearing platform?","Ruth Porat","Still too early.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","But is it at least -- it makes sense that you get some benefit or there is just no way to tell at all.","Ruth Porat","No, our assumption is there is some benefit. There is benefit to it. And trying to quantify it for our call, it's too early, or to estimate (inaudible) capital, too early.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay. And just a follow-up on the spread question on the deposits. As you pull in $55 billion over the next 24 months. How do we think about, you talked about your leverage is more in the short-end, but in the near-term I assume you are putting it mostly in the AFS portfolio.","Ruth Porat","Correct.","James Mitchell - Buckingham Research","And with the backup in yields in the intermediate bond area, wouldn\u2019t you get some benefit. I know your target was 1% spread before the rate spike, should we be assuming a little bit better than that?","Ruth Porat","We are still fairly short and it's been our philosophy given we have been in the low interest rate environment is to keep duration short, given the inevitable rise in rates would prove to be a financial drag, and I think that was the right thing to do.","Operator","The next question will come from Roger Freeman with Barclays.","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital","I guess just on the FICC business, you are talking about risk having come down in May, with markets more normalized this sort of the level of liquidity provision going up. And what was -- the client may just the volatility or I know you had some management changes too so I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s factored in there.","Ruth Porat","I was concerned from the team about potential market volatility and just thinking that was it prudent risk management to bring risk down in the business given that concern. And we\u2019re pleased that they did.","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital","And market normalcy has returned from your perspective so far as where it seems like we learn that from others?","Ruth Porat","It does seem that way, yes.","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital","And just back on the buyback and CCAR, I know you\u2019ve probably said what you can, but just thinking about the 1%, is that a mechanical outcome of this provision to be able to apply for that and not to read into that one way or another as to the Fed's thinking on approving capital stock buyback requests with say your leverage ratio where it is against the target? Are they separate issues?","Ruth Porat","Well, there\u2019s the provision that you have the opportunity to apply to use 1% of your tier-1 capital, but it's still an approval. And so we're pleased to receive the approval no objection and to be able to proceed.","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital","And I guess the only other on the clearing rollout, how's that in the swaps businesses. How's that going from your perspective? And it seems like what we\u2019re hearing from others is no real impact on customer volumes. Have you found the same thing?","Ruth Porat","Yes. The big event was obviously category two. The move went well. Clients are ready. We didn't have operational issues. We do think the staggered rollout of clients was constructive between category one and category two. At this point it's premature to judge I think the impact fully on market activity because there were so many other exogenous events. But it went well and we feel we are well positioned.","Operator","The next question will come from Fiona Swaffield with RBC.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets","Two things. Firstly on the Basel III look through the 9.9 versus Q1. I don't know if you could talk about the numerator and the denominator, because the RWAs keep on going down in fixed income, but there seems to be something offsetting it was the first question. And the second question was the total exposure number. So the supplementary leverage ratio exposure and the move to that through to full. If we look back and you have that big reduction in FICC Basel III RWAs, could you tell us where the exposure would have been or the leverage ratio would have been at the bottom, just to work out what the correlation is potentially?","Ruth Porat","Okay. So, on the first question, the Basel III firm wide RWAs are $426 billion. Some of the movement between the first quarter and the second quarter obviously there is earnings accretion. There was obviously the charge associated with the Wealth Management acquisition and then just finalization of the rules. That gets you to the 9.9%. And then could you repeat the question regarding the leverage ratio?","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets","I'm just trying to understand the moving parts on the total exposure, because we've obviously seen the fixed income RWAs come down a lot in the last 18 months and you\u2019re getting more towards the end of that process. So how much is the total exposure going down is really due to the fixed income? Is it -- those total exposure numbers would have been much higher before you started reducing the fixed income book.","Ruth Porat","It would have been much higher before we started reducing the fixed income book. And I think the two buckets that I broke out, one, the RWA reduction and the RWAs in fixed income were $390 billion at the peak. They\u2019re down to $239 billion and most of that really is in areas that are relevant to the growth subs, in particular our structure credit, credit correlation business. So yes, we've absolutely benefited from what we\u2019re doing and we continue to be on an execution perhaps to take it down even more, which is what gives us the confidence we can continue to do so. And then similarly, we\u2019ve moved, already moved quite a bit. We were early in central clearing. And so we\u2019re already seeing some benefit in the denominator from the move to central clearing and look forward to continuing to execute on that portion.","Operator","The final question will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate the disclosure, particularly specific to Wealth Management loans on page 12. I guess I'm just curious as to if there is any dollar target or growth target of those loans now that you've got deposits obviously flowing in from the MSSB transaction, given your ongoing statements about trying to grow the spread revenue within wealth management?","Ruth Porat","So, I may give you a somewhat unsatisfactory answer because I'm not going to be able to quantify it by buckets, and the reason is, we've said consistently that we are leading with credit risk management and that it will be a prudent build-out of the portfolio and that is how we are continuing to build it. So, the deposits are going to continue to grow and support growth and lending product both for wealth management and institutional securities. And on the wealth management side, the biggest growth is on the securities based lending and secondarily on residential mortgages. We have 5% penetration of our clients relative to our peers who have 10%. So, our view is that there is tremendous upside. We've got a tailwind there but we're, again, leading with prudent steady growth and that's going to be the continued philosophy around it.","And then on the institutional side, that's also how we are going to be utilizing some of the deposits. We do get a funding benefit when we move dollar for dollar funding benefit when we substitute unsecured debt with the more efficient deposits. So, certain product does move to the bank and obviously our relationship or maybe not obviously, our relationship in that lending is in the bank. And then we have an attractive opportunity growing bank appropriate product in the bank. So areas where we already have very strong teams, domain expertise, client base, like commercial real estate lending, asset-based funding, project finance, we can grow the lending suite, an area we hadn't here too far been focused on. So, it is a real diversified portfolio of assets supporting growth on both wealth management and the institutional securities businesses that we'll build over time. And we'll be sharing more about the bank and the bank strategy over time given the growth that we are seeing there.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Then just switching gears a little bit, James, maybe a question for you in terms of how you are thinking about the long-term total payout ratio of the firm given that you've now taken a big step towards that with the announcement of the 500 million share buyback?","James Gorman","Well, as I say, journey of the 1,000 miles begins with a single step and we've had our first step, that's really what mattered. We don't want to get ahead of that obviously. It's what payout ratios are. It's going to be a function of where absolute earnings are and managing against the changing regulatory environment. But what we wanted to do is put ourselves in a position where we could launch a buyback and begin that process which is what we did.","Celeste Mellet Brown","Thank you so much for joining our second quarter call and we look forward to speaking to you again in October.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"15062":["Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call October 17, 2017  8:15 AM ET","Executives","Sharon Yeshaya - Head of IR","James Gorman - Chairman & CEO","Jonathan Pruzan - CFO & Executive VP","Analysts","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Michael Mayo - Wells Fargo Securities","Steven Chubak - Nomura Securities","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Alevizos Alevizakos - HSBC","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Sharon Yeshaya","Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. ","Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. ","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James Gorman","Thanks, Sharon. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us. While the third quarter was impacted by the typical summer slowdown across many of our businesses, our results reaffirmed that we can generate solid returns against a more subdued backdrop. Strong performance in Wealth Management and Investment Management and stable results in the market-sensitive businesses demonstrated the importance of the balanced business model. ","Wealth Management posted record revenues. Margins remained in excess of our target range. These results were achieved despite slower transactional activity. We continue to witness growth in fee-based assets, which surpassed $1 trillion in this quarter. Clients continued to choose the enhanced service models provided by this offering. This trend has reduced our resilience -- our reliance on transactional activity. Incremental revenues will continue to drive margin improvement, subject, of course, to decisions to invest in initiatives that have the potential to further accelerate growth. These investments include not only our digital build-out but also further enhancements to our advisory platforms, lending cash management products and integrated, goal-based planning solutions. ","Within Institutional Securities, Investment Banking showed continued strength, particularly in advisory, notwithstanding the amount of uncertainty around the political and fiscal outlook. Sales & Trading was impacted by the environment, characterized by a seasonal slowdown, muted client activity and low levels of volatility. That said, Equity Sales & Trading demonstrated consistency despite subdued activity. Fixed Income remained above our $1 billion run rate per our average quarterly revenue goal, and Investment Management exhibited steady performance with a combination of positive flows across our actively managed strategies. ","Often an underappreciated part of our firm, Investment Management represents a high-returning business with a complementary mix of traditional and alternative platforms. We continue to explore both organic and inorganic opportunities in this space. Our pending acquisition of Mesa West Capital serves as the most recent example. Mesa West complements our existing real estate product offerings and provides us with an opportunity to leverage our current distribution channels. ","We continued to see signs of operating leverage across our business model, not just in Wealth Management, where it's most apparent. Incremental revenue is expected to generate higher margins, assuming we continue to manage our cost base with discipline. That said, we won't be shy about reinvesting where we see market and competitive opportunities. The Mesa West acquisition and the continuing build-out of our U.S. banks serve as examples of this choice. ","Finally, as has been widely discussed in every corner of our sector, there are 3 additional medium- to long-term drivers of performance improvements for our industry, corporate taxes, rates and any changes to the regulatory framework. To repeat what is commonly understood, as a firm, we have a relatively high corporate tax rate given our meaningful U.S. presence. Second, we continue to be positioned to benefit from higher interest rates. And third, we are heavily regulated, not least in the area of capital, which culminates with the CCAR exam. While the degree of these changes will become clearer only over time, they should not go unnoted. In the near term, we continue to have good client receptivity around the globe. And absent any material changes to macro conditions, we remain confident in the goals we have set for this year. ","I'll now turn the call over to Jon.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you, and good morning. The operating environment we witnessed in the third quarter, in many respects, represented a continuation of the second quarter's market conditions. Client conviction remained limited. Activity and volatility were muted across several markets, impacting Sales & Trading in particular. Typical summer patterns added to the lackluster tone. Despite this somewhat uninspired trading environment, results remained solid with strong performance in Investment Banking and Investment Management and consistent revenue growth in Wealth Management. At $9.2 billion, firm revenues were in excess of $9 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter. In the quarter, PBT was $2.5 billion and EPS was $0.93. ROE was 9.6%. These numbers were aided by certain tax benefits that I will discuss in detail shortly. These tax benefits contributed approximately $0.05 of EPS and 50 basis points of ROE. ","Our year-to-date efficiency ratio of 72% is well inside the 74% target we've set for 2017. This is evidence that the Project Streamline expense savings initiatives we embarked on at the beginning of last year are coming to fruition. Underscoring the firm's operating leverage, year-to-date revenue is up $2.8 billion or 11%, and pretax profit is up $1.3 billion or 20% over the same period last year. ","Going forward, our focus will be on ensuring that the savings achieved to date are kept permanently out of the expense base in an effort to maximize operating leverage across all of our businesses. Over the quarter, non-compensation expenses were down $63 million or 2%, primarily driven by the absence of the VAT provision recorded in the second quarter. We continue to exercise compensation discipline, contributing to a 2% sequential decline in total noninterest expense. ","Now to the businesses. Net revenues in our Institutional Securities businesses of $4.4 billion were down 8% sequentially. In addition to the seasonal slowdown across several of the businesses, volatility in many asset classes remained at or near multiyear lows. And there were fewer idiosyncratic market-moving events. Consequently, client activity slowed from the second quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 3% sequentially. Compensation expenses were $1.5 billion. Our year-to-date compensation to net revenue ratio was approximately 35%, in line with our target of 37% or lower. ","Investment Banking continued to show strength in advisory and debt underwriting. Revenues of $1.3 billion were down 10% versus a strong second quarter. We continue to leverage our global franchise, working with clients to provide holistic solutions. This consistent focus has contributed to an improvement in several of our market positions. Advisory revenues for the quarter were $555 million, up 10% sequentially. Despite a decrease in larger transformational deals, M&A volumes are healthy and on par with last year's levels. A combination of challenging organic growth and attractive financing markets continues to drive activity. ","Turning to underwriting. While equity volumes have recovered relative to the low levels of activity experienced over the course of last year, the quarter-over-quarter results showed a traditional seasonal trend with slower activity in the summer months. We generated equity underwriting revenues of $273 million, down 33% sequentially. We expect healthy activity levels in the fourth quarter, subject to issuance windows remaining open, which may be impacted by macro-economic uncertainties, geopolitical events and a typical seasonal slowdown at the end of the year. ","Fixed Income underwriting revenues decreased 12% sequentially to $442 million, driven primarily by lower investment-grade issuance. High-yield markets have continued to be very receptive to both acquisition financing and opportunistic refinancings, aided by range-bound credit spreads, low volatility and significant market liquidity. Overall, Investment Banking pipelines are healthy and diversified across products, regions and sectors. CEO confidence remains high, and we are actively engaged with our clients. However, we maintain a cautious outlook as political and policy uncertainties may influence management's decision to act. ","In Sales & Trading, we supported our clients when opportunities presented themselves and prudently managed risk throughout the quarter. Our results were consistent with the market backdrop. And overall, revenues were in line with historical third quarters. In Equities, we retained our leadership position and expect to be #1 globally. Revenues were $1.9 billion, down 12% sequentially. Our global footprint and diversified strategy continued to enable us to benefit from pockets of regional strength.","Sequentially, Europe was weaker coming off a seasonally high second quarter, but continued strength in Asia buoyed our results. Prime Brokerage revenues remain a source of stability and client balances continue to grow. Derivatives saw a sequential decrease on fewer corporate transactions, which can be lumpy. And cash revenues remain stable as lower volumes and subdued volatility were combined with a more benign market-making environment. ","Fixed Income revenues in the third quarter were $1.2 billion, down 6% versus the second quarter. Our macro businesses were negatively impacted by sequentially lower results in foreign exchange and persistently low levels of volatilities in rates, where client activity remain muted. As we have discussed, activity in these businesses is often aided by discrete events or meaningful market trends. Lack of such events or trends weighed on results. In credit, revenues were also down quarter-over-quarter. In aggregate, spreads remained at very tight levels, negatively impacting volatility and client demand. Commodities saw a sequential increase as activity improved in the quarter. ","Overall, this quarter's results reinforce the progress we have made in this business. We have continued to support our clients and have generated revenues in excess of the $1 billion goal for 6 consecutive quarters against a variety of market backdrops. We remain confident in the strategy outlined nearly 2 years ago and we are pleased with the performance. Lastly, average trading VaR for the period was $43 million, down versus $51 million last quarter, primarily driven by lower market volatility across both equity and fixed income markets. ","Turning to Wealth Management, which reported further growth in both revenues and pretax profits relative to last quarter's record levels. Our business continues to benefit from a shift towards an advice-driven model with a decreased reliance on transactional activity. This quarter's results further underscored this trend as growth in asset management revenues more than offset the seasonal slowdown in transactional revenues. ","Third quarter revenues were $4.2 billion, a 2% sequential increase. At 26.5% for the quarter, the PBT margin now exceeds 25% year-to-date. The margin increase reflects the benefit of our scale platform with operating leverage across both compensation and non-compensation expenses. Year-to-date, revenue grew 9% or $1.1 billion. At the same time, we saw a total expenses growth of only 5% with non-compensation expenses down and continued compensation discipline. As a result, pretax profit is up 24%. ","Total client assets grew by 3% to $2.3 trillion. We continue to witness strong client demand for our advisory solutions. Fee-based asset inflows were $16 billion in the quarter, contributing to a record year-to-date flows. These flows represent an important organic growth driver of this business. Total fee-based assets increased 4% and are now in excess of $1 trillion or 43% of total client assets. Higher asset levels and strong quarterly flows contributed to asset management revenues of $2.4 billion, representing 4% growth relative to the second quarter. Net interest income of $1 billion is up 2% over the last quarter, reflecting the benefit from both higher rates and lending balances. This was partially offset by higher funding costs, which include a higher blended BDP rate as well as the cost of incremental CDs, saving products and third-party liabilities that are part of our diversified bank funding strategy. ","Wealth Management lending in the U.S. banks grew by about $1 billion in the quarter or 2%. Continued strength in loan production offset the impact of higher paydowns in the quarter. With year-to-date net interest income of $3 billion, up approximately 19% year-on-year, we remain on our way to generate full year NII growth in line with the guidance we had provided. Transactional revenues of $739 million were down 4% from Q2. The decline reflected a typical decrease in retail engagement during the summer months across both equity and fixed income markets as well as the slower underwriting calendar. ","Total noninterest expenses were essentially unchanged versus Q2. The compensation ratio was 55%, in line with our stated targets. Non-compensation expenses were down 3% sequentially due to seasonally lower marketing and business development expenses. This quarter's performance clearly demonstrates the strength of the franchise and the powerful combination of a highly annuitized revenue mix and the operating leverage that comes from a scale platform. We continued to enhance this business profile by investing in our advisory platforms, digital capabilities and banking and lending products. ","Investment Management witnessed another solid quarter with continued growth in asset management fees and strong investment results. Total net revenues were $675 million, up 2% quarter-over-quarter. Overall, AUM grew 3% to $447 billion. We witnessed positive flows and strong investment performance, particularly across our active equity strategies. We continue to see increased investor interest in our high-conviction strategies across the platform. On the back of higher AUM, we saw 5% growth in asset management fees to $568 million. Investment revenues were also strong at $114 million, primarily due to more recent private funds entering carry. As discussed in the past, we expect this line item to continue to be lumpy. Overall expenses of $544 million were up 4% quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher compensation expense on carried interest. ","As James mentioned, in the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Mesa West Capital. This will complement our existing real estate and private credit offering with a premier commercial real estate credit strategy. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter. We will continue to opportunistically evaluate tactical acquisitions across our Investment Management platform as we further grow this high-return business. ","Turning to the balance sheet. On a sequential basis, total spot assets of $854 billion were up $13 billion. In the quarter, the binding constraint for our risk-based capital ratios shifted from advanced to the standardized approach framework. Our pro forma fully phased-in standardized RWAs are expected to be essentially unchanged as higher credit RWAs offset a decline in market-risk RWAs. Our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III standardized Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is expected to increase slightly to 16.3%. Our pro forma fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio is expected to remain at 6.5%. ","During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $1.25 billion of common stock or approximately 27 million shares and our board declared a $0.25 dividend per share. Our tax rate in the third quarter was 28.1%. This included a total of $94 million of net discrete tax benefits, $11 million related to the recurring type of discrete tax item for employee share-based payments and the balance primarily resulting from the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets -- excuse me, deferred taxes. ","This quarter, results reaffirm that our balanced business model is performing. At the beginning of 2016, we presented a 2-year plan. Over the last 7 quarters, we have witnessed a variety of economic backdrops. And while this quarter certainly did not present the most constructive backdrop for some of our businesses, our performance was consistent with our stated objectives. We are encouraged by the continued growth in our more annuitized businesses, providing a buffer to those businesses that are more sensitive to quarterly changes in the environment. We remain focused on executing our strategic plan throughout the rest of the year and, absent any material changes to macro conditions, we are confident that we will hit our stated objectives. ","With that, we will open up the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell","Maybe just on the Wealth Management side, you guys had very good growth -- sequential growth in deposits. There's been some discussion in the industry about kind of a pricing pressure. Can you discuss where you saw deposit rates in Wealth Management business and how you were able to attract, I think, about $10 billion sequentially on deposit franchise?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. I think, as you recall, we've been talking about our deposit deployment strategy for quite some time. And we've been investing excess liquidity into our loan product over the last several years. In the beginning of the year, we told you that, that trend would come to an end. We did see that this year. It happened a bit sooner than we anticipated as we saw more cash go into the markets, particularly the equity markets as those markets rose around the world. And we've seen cash in our clients' accounts at its lowest level. So what we had been doing over the last several years is building out our product suite in that business. As you recall, we were really just a solo product with the BDP product. So we've built out those products, particularly around our cash management engaged initiatives around savings products as well as CDs and other products to sort of supplement our deposit base.","In terms of the pricing, we had 4 rate hikes over the last 2 years. We did, at the end of the second quarter raise our rates across the platform in the broker deposit channel. Those rates were predominantly sort of pegged at 1 or 2 basis points. They're now on average about 6 basis points. But we have been supplementing our deposit base with other savings products and CDs. And you see the cost of that running through the interest expense line. So started the year at $154 billion of deposits, it drifted down to $144 billion as people engaged in the market and deployed their cash. And it's now back at $154 billion again with a slightly different mix, but back to sort of the historical year-end level.","James Mitchell","Okay, great. And maybe, just the follow-up, just on your asset management acquisitions, you've got sort of a new tone, I guess, or more aggressive tone about further acquisitions. Is there particular asset classes you're looking at? Is it focused still on alternatives? Or do you see you'd like to have scale in other asset classes?","James Gorman","I think there are a bunch of areas across the asset management platform we could continue to build out. We have looked obviously at Fixed Income, where we have smaller space. We have a relatively narrow but very productive active asset management business on the long-only side. And so there are some geographic areas where we could fill in. In this case, it was in the alternatives platform. Real estate has been, for most of our history, a tremendous strength. We have a great team running it. The business is doing well. They've launched new funds. This made sense to us. So I think what we're signaling, and Jim, you're picking up on it, is we're open for business to find inorganic pieces that can help build out parts of our platform that make sense. We're not looking for any grand splash here, but we're open for business opportunistically. And this was a perfect example. We looked at another deal over the last couple of quarters. And in the end, it got too expensive, we pulled away from it. So we're going to keep pricing discipline.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Just a follow-up on Jim's question on the wealth deposit cost and the CD program. The CD program has gotten a lot of attention. And it certainly seems to be successful here in bumping up the deposit base. How much of the $25 million in interest expense that you guys saw quarter-over-quarter was attributable to this CD program? And when you guys think about that cash, I believe it's an 11-month program, how sticky do you think that is? And what are you guys working on to try to make sure it's as sticky as possible?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. Let me try to take a crack at that. There are a couple of different points. Just remember, we have not made a huge effort historically to build out incremental products in the wealth -- in the deposit side, because we were sitting on so many excess deposits. So this is new for us. We've been working on this cash management engaged initiative as well as building out sort of traditional CD products. And we will continue to diversify our funding mix and our liability stack. And we also have access to wholesale markets, including brokerage CDs and FHLB and external sweeps and other things. So this is really around the right composition and mix of a liability stack. In terms of the interest expense, Brennan, it was a combination of both. The increase -- the BDP increase really happened at the very end of the second quarter, taking up from 1 -- a little over 1 basis point to 6 basis points.","So some of that increase is from that; and the rest would be from a combination of the CDs. We ran some savings promotions as well. Mind you, this is for existing clients and new money only. And we're obviously not alone in running promotional programs to increase the deposit levels. I think in terms of stickiness, as James has mentioned and I have mentioned, we are seeing more of our clients engage with us on the advisory platforms. We're providing more services and products for them. And I think we're approaching the clients holistically both on the asset as well as the liability side. As I said, we're new to this, so we'll have to see what the numbers play out. But we're very confident regarding the liquidity position that we have in the banks.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, great. And -- okay, so the BDP came at the end of the quarter, so there might be a little follow-through to next, that's fine.","Jonathan Pruzan","No, it came at the end of the second -- I think we raised rates either June 30 or July 1. So we did see the full impact of the BDP rate. We didn't see the full impact of sort of the incremental deposits because those were raised over the second and third quarter.","Brennan Hawken","I see, okay. Thanks for clarifying that. As far as shifting gears to MiFID, when you guys think about MiFID coming here in the capital markets businesses, how are you thinking this is going to impact your European business next year? And when you think about balancing not only the payment for research but also the enhanced liquidity throughout European trading operations, how do you manage the potential impact of spreads through that enhanced transparency? And how do you intend to -- how do you think about sizing that potential impact?","Jonathan Pruzan","Well, a couple different components there. Number one, we are the #1 equities business globally with a sort of -- with an integrated platform and a leading research product. MiFID has been coming for a while. And we've been actively engaged with our clients discussing this change. Those conversations are obviously very unique based on usage and needs of our individual clients. But those conversations have been constructive and ongoing. And we've also been investing in the platforms and the infrastructure to be in compliance. In terms of how it impacts the market, remember, we have, give or take, an $8 billion Equity business. This is a smaller component of that business. We have an integrated platform and provide value-added services through intellectual capital access, liquidity and whatnot. And we've approached our Sales & Trading clients holistically.","So it will have an impact. Trying to measure that is sort of hard at this point. Our sense is, it's going to be a little bumpy because it's not clear that everyone is going to be ready for the switchover in January 3. But we would expect it, a, to be manageable; and b, potentially longer term as the #1 player in this space, if people do consolidate trading with counterparties, we would expect to be the beneficiary of that. So overall, a change, but we adapt to change all the time. We think it's manageable. And it has the potential to accrue to our benefit.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Just maybe an update. In Wealth Management, in the past, you've provided statistics on, I guess, the last time you showed it, 100% of days in the year, you earn between $50 million and $70 million. Is that still the right range? Is the range rising as -- interest rates as you go more fee-based and the markets go up? And then while I'm getting greedy, if you might update us on what percentage of assets are in the $1 million and above camp inside Wealth Management?","Jonathan Pruzan","Wow, those are pretty technical questions. I think still good. How about still good. Lots of stability in this business and good tailwinds. Obviously, the total revenues generated are increasing. But I still feel like it's in that range in terms of a good indicator on a daily basis. The nice thing about this business is not only the stability and the growth dynamic, but we've got some nice tailwinds behind it. Also if you look at the fee-based accounts and the fee-based revenues, it's now over 50% of the revenues in that business this quarter. So again, lots of stability and lots of continued operating -- opportunity for operating leverage going forward. The general shape and characteristics of the business are pretty stable.","Glenn Schorr","And maybe a question on the margins inside Wealth Management, obviously a big number this quarter. As interest income becomes a bigger part, as your deposit programs take hold, I mean, obviously markets go up and down. But you're managing cost there. You have another 150 basis point of benefit coming in a little more than a year. Do you think pretax margins can consistently grind higher? And is there any natural ceiling there?","James Gorman","I guess, that's sort of the early question around, \"Are we going to change our margin targets or whatever?\" Listen, the incremental dollar revenue is coming on with an incremental higher margin than the embedded margin. So in theory, absolutely they grind higher. In practice though, we've got to look at -- we're also focused on growth. And what the management team in that business is doing is looking for ways in which we can drive further growth over the next several years rather than trying to grind out a particular margin in a particular quarter. But you're right. The math suggests with what's happening with retention deals coming off and what's happening with interest rates, margin should grind higher. But again, I'm as much -- more focused frankly on total growth than I am on the incremental margin in a given quarter.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Michael Mayo","Can you hear me?","James Gorman","Yes, we can, Mike.","Michael Mayo","Okay. So your U.S. bank deposits are back to $154 billion and that's almost the size of the 11th largest bank. And I know this is a new realm for you guys, but what is your deposit beta on those $154 billion of deposits? And what I'm really trying to get to is the first couple questions, what should we expect in the future? What do you have planned as far as future CD campaigns or a little bit more on your strategy?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. That's a great question, Mike. Let me just step back for a minute and just sort of talk about NII more globally or at the top of the house. We have seen really good growth in that line item. Year-to-date, we're up just under $500 million. Some of that is on an increase in the lending balances. We're up about $6 billion or $7 billion. Some of that is based on the beta concept. As I've just mentioned, we've had 4 rate hikes over 2 years. This was the first time we raised our BDP rate. We raised it, on average, about 6 basis points. So on the last hike, the 6 over 25% would suggest a 25% beta. Based on historical behavior and our model suggests closer to a 50% beta is the right number to look at going forward. But we're in a new environment of, a, rising rates; b, we've seen money market reform; c, there's been a lot of changes in technology and how people save money.","So I would say that, to date, we've outperformed the beta assumption. But we still think that 50%-ish is the right way to think about it going forward. That also being said, as rates get higher, betas get higher, as you know. In terms of the overall strategy, we are getting more mature in this business and in our liability structure. We have sort of made it through, if you will, the excess liquidity position. We still have some, given that we've just raised the deposit number from the $144 billion to $154 billion, we do have excess liquidity today to continue to fund lending growth going forward. But we're going to have a mix of products that support future lending growth.","We still feel good about the lending opportunity within our wealth client segment. Penetration rates are still reasonably limited. And we've seen opportunities to continue to increase penetration there. And the funding will be a mix of all of the liabilities that I talked about earlier. We do -- we would like to continue to build out this cash management engaged initiative, which should bring in savings deposits, some mix. We raised about, give or take, a couple billion dollars in savings this quarter, probably $5 billion or $6 billion of CDs. That's both within the network and externally; and then a couple -- some incremental wholesale liabilities. So again, we have plenty of access to liabilities. BDP will be and will continue to be our primary product and our biggest contributor. But this is a day that we have expected for a long time and have sort of been building out the capabilities in advance of it.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet.","Steven Chubak","I had a question on Wealth Management as well, but just actually on the fee income side of the equation. So as we think about some of the fee income tailwinds outside of higher markets, one of the biggest ones that you've spoken to is the continued pace of conversions from brokerage to fee-based. We certainly saw that, that benefited results this quarter. And especially in light of DOL implementation likely to be delayed and potentially tabled, how should we think about the pace of fee-based conversions from here as that seemed to provide a nice tailwind to some of the acceleration that we saw in recent quarters?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. Listen, the year-to-date flows have been very strong and they've not been solely driven by DOL. A significant amount of the conversions this quarter came from non-retirement accounts. So while I think the DOL implementation or the original implementation did form a catalyst for some conversions, it's not been the primary driver, number one. Number two, as we continue to build out the goals-based platform, as we continue to build out digital and our other services, I think our clients are attracted to the value-added proposition of a managed account and we see that trend continuing. It's been a nice tailwind, as you say. And we'll see the benefits of that going forward. As you know, there's a lag between the fees and the flows. But it's been really quite positive and diversified, not only driven by retirement accounts.","Steven Chubak","And maybe a broader question on how you're thinking about capital management and some strategic growth initiatives. And one of the things that comes up quite often in discussions is that, as we look at the various capital constraints, you're much more leveraged than risk-based constrained than many of your peers. And as you think about potential opportunities to either better optimize your capital base or -- and even consider or demonstrate some willingness to explore inorganic growth opportunities, are you open to expanding into areas that are maybe more risk-intensive and which could potentially help you optimize against some of your more constraining capital ratios such as leverage?","James Gorman","Steve, it's James. I think that's a much broader discussion than we'd probably do justice on an earnings call. We've worked very hard in the last several years to get ourselves in a position where our buyback and dividend combined generated close to 100% payout. We still believe we're carrying significant excess capital. And you're right, at this point in time, the leverage ratio has been the constrained at least the last couple of CCARs. Now whether that continues remains to be seen. I think the team, we're acutely conscious of risk-based capital, leverage-based capital tradeoffs. I think we've started, as evidenced by the Mesa West transaction, to show that we're not shy about doing inorganic things where they make sense. We're not interested in particularly making a splash on that front.","We like businesses where we have real scale advantages. That's where we're aggressive. And Wealth Management was the example on that. But otherwise, they tend to be inorganic, should be much more tactical, I would think, in general. So it's a much longer discussion. But at this point, we'd like to continue -- we have a lot of shares outstanding. We've got our dividend to $1 a share on an annual basis. We like to continue to pursue the buyback dividend strategy and excess capital. Once we see more clarity around the regulatory framework, if and when we see we have more excess capital, then we'll put that to work either inorganically or with further buybacks or indeed against some of the risk-based businesses that we're in.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski","You alluded, Jon, a little bit to targets for Wealth Management lending growth and kind of the headroom that you see. I was hoping that maybe you could give us a little bit more of a quantitative sense for how you assess your penetration versus competitors, client appetite and, therefore, sort of what you see as a headroom for prudent lending.","Jonathan Pruzan","Well, again, I would say that we've seen continued growth in the lending product across Wealth Management across the 3 products, mortgage, securities-based loans and tailored product. In '16, that was $10 billion. To date, it's been about $7 billion. We've seen good loan production across all 3 channels -- or excuse me, all 3 products. We did see some big payoffs at the end of the quarter that muted our total balances outstanding this quarter. But we continue to see real receptivity within the wealth client network for these products. We're continually designing products that we think that fit within the footprint. Based on market data, it suggests that our penetration rates are lower than some others, so we think that we continue to have room both on the SBL and on the mortgage product. And we've seen consistent production over the last several years. So it sort of gives us confidence that we will continue to be able to grow those balances going forward.","James Gorman","The other thing I'd just add about -- strategically about that business is the lending side provides a lot of stickiness with the relationships. So I was on a phone call with a client yesterday. His adviser left to a competitive firm, a multi-hundred million dollar relationship. We have a significant loan out to that client. And the client has no interest in moving because they like the loan that we have. They like the funding they're getting from that. They -- in fact, after the call, he said they were likely to increase their assets here. So that stickiness for the high end is a big deal. These markets go in cycles as we all know. And people want access to credit. They have large illiquid positions, so concentrated stock in businesses they founded, and they don't necessarily want to liquidate that. And we're in a position where we're dealing with a lot of very, very wealthy people. I think 2% of our assets with clients with less than $100,000 with us. So the vast majority have significant wealth. And it's a real competitive advantage now to be able to compete with the banks and offer these lending products.","Guy Moszkowski","That's a good point. Follow-up question, just on targets again. You were asked the one about Wealth Management margin targets, but what about fixed? Given that in what was clearly a very challenging quarter, you well exceeded that $1 billion quarterly level. Any potential movement on your goal there?","James Gorman","Guy, when we set the targets, it was the beginning of 2016 for 2017. And we said we'd like to see 4 things happen, an ROE range of 9% to 11% in 2017. We've hit that each quarter; efficiency ratio driven by Project Streamline of 74% expense to revenue, and we've been below that for the 3 quarters; Wealth Management margin, 23% to 25%, and we're now operating above that level; and the fourth, of course, was the Fixed Income division's revenues, which we thought, given what the team did with the restructuring in the fourth quarter '15, I think it was, we thought that the business model stood on its own with about $1 billion in revenue. That wasn't obviously an aspirational performance. But we thought that's what it should do. And recall, we've had a couple of quarters around $500 million, $600 million.","First quarter of '16, I think we did about $800 million and change. And since then, we've had, what's that, 6 quarters of consecutive $1 billion-plus. It's actually probably average. I haven't look at the numbers, but my guess is it's averaged $1.25 billion over that time. So clearly, we exceeded the $1 billion. I don't know. We'll think through the end of the year. I don't think there's a lot of point in trying to nail ourselves to a specific revenue target for a business as volatile as that. I haven't seen our competitors do that. What we wanted to do was say we want it full-blown minimum. It's not sort of a race to -- we could drive revenues in that business harder, but we'd use more balance sheet and we wouldn't necessarily have the same risk profile we've got, so there are tradeoffs in it. And at this point, we're really happy with what the team has done. I think they've done a terrific job.","They've taken a business that was really on its heels. And it's clearly become competitive on a global basis. It will never have the macro businesses of the big banks, but it's really performing well across the franchise. So I doubt you're going to see new targets in that. I just don't see a lot of upside for that. And I don't think people can sensibly predict revenue outlooks for something that volatile, but what we did seek to was a minimum revenue number. And let's get through the end of this year, we've got another quarter to go.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O'Connor","You guys had touched on efficiency a couple of times, and specifically Wealth Management. But I guess, just to circle back, from a firm-wide point of view, how much more opportunity is there? I guess I step back and I think that your businesses are higher expense-based in general, but you also have leading market shares in a lot of what you do, have been executing well, as you pointed out, in getting the efficiency ratio down, you're exceeding your plan this year. But just how much more opportunity is there for maybe continued low-hanging fruit in the back office or within the institutional business?","James Gorman","Yes, I don't think there's a lot of -- Jon will comment on this, but I don't think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit. I mean, we've been at this for a few years. So I think we have a pretty good handle on our expenses. The primary driver is, of course, the compensation expense. And I think, the ranges we have given in each of the businesses make sense. I think, our ISG comp ratio this quarter was around 35%. Wealth Management is obviously higher because of the payout structure in that business, but it's been grinding lower over time as non-compensable revenues come onstream. And the Investment Management businesses tend to come out around the 40%, 42%, 44%, somewhere in that range. So that's a number that honestly is more a function of what the revenues are. The non-comp expenses, we have held pretty tight, in fact, extremely.","And we've taken, I think, the obvious low-hanging fruit off the table. But as you point out, these businesses are scale businesses. The non-comp expenses in Wealth Management, I think, Jon, were down a little bit this quarter on significantly higher revenues. And in the institutional businesses, there's a lot been going on with CCAR and resolution planning that has added expenses. We had the resubmission of CCAR last year. We had the British VAT tax issue, which hit the non-comps. We're still grinding through the last of the litigation from the crisis that you see pop along in little dribs and drabs every quarter. And we're increasing our spend, as you would want us to do, on cybersecurity. We're making big investments in digital. ","We're driving a lot of electronic transformation within the institutional business. So there are areas where we're investing in the platform because we want to build a Morgan Stanley of the next 5 to 10 years, not the last 5 years. So short answer is, I think, low-hanging fruit, we have pretty much picked up. Scale in the businesses really matters. That's why you saw, I think, with a 9% year-over-year revenue, it was something like 15% to 18% pretax increase. And we're trading off sensible investments for long-term growth versus short-term fill-ups. And I think what you're going to see with every $1 of incremental revenue, you will still see a higher incremental margin coming on even with those investments. Jon, is there anything I missed there?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. No, I think you've hit it. I think we continue -- if you just look at the non-comp line, we continue to try to make progress on there. If you recall, when we came out with our targets at the beginning of '16, we didn't really expect the incremental CCAR that we got from the resubmission. Brexit wasn't on the table. So there are things that pop up all over the place that sort of cause that business -- cause those expenses to move around a little bit. But again, on an incremental basis, we've shown some really nice discipline and trends in both the areas that we can really control. We have seen a little bit of an uptick in the BC&E and transaction taxes as our strength in outside of the U.S. has continued to grow. So Europe and Asia generally come with higher expenses in the Sales & Trading businesses. But our hope is that we'll continue to maintain the discipline. Maybe some of the investments that we're making around automation will lead to better efficiency that might be able to bring down the unit cost a little bit more. But I would agree with James that sort of the low-hanging fruit is sort of -- we've sort of taken that out already.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","I apologize if you've addressed this already, but as an Advanced Approach bank, could you tell us what your LCR ratio, liquidity coverage ratio, was this quarter? And where do you hope to manage that to?","Jonathan Pruzan","Our LCR for the second quarter was in the high 120s. We would expect it to maintain that level or it has maintained that level. It's going to bounce around a little bit. But clearly, the 100% limitation is not a binding constraint for us at all within the liquidity -- within our liquidity framework. So again, it's not -- it hasn't been a constraint for us. I don't expect it to be one in terms of the management of our liquidity. We look at our stress tests and resolution and all the different analysis that we do. And it has generally not been a binding constraint for either -- for the institution.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Subsequent to your second quarter call, obviously the Treasury came out in October with their new white paper on their views of where the changes in the capital market regulations should head. Can you guys give us some color on 1 or 2 of the regulations that's most important to Morgan Stanley that you'd like to see changed?","Jonathan Pruzan","Well, again, specifically to the October white paper, it was really around the capital markets. I think we're broadly supportive. It was a very large and dense document. Anything that improves the liquidity of markets would be a positive. Anything that reduces the unnecessary administrative burden would be a positive. Anything that reduces complexity around the implementation or the compliance with the regulations would be a positive. Generally, the tone, broadly speaking, has been positive. It's been around recalibration and simplification. And so whether you're talking about Volcker or CCAR or the SLR resolution, which was generally the topics that get discussed, anything that would simplify those, anything that would reduce the complexity and the overlapping nature would be positive. We think the tone, at least from the Fed right now, has been around that simplification process. And we'll see what and if anything gets done over time as people get into their seats and their new jobs.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC.","Alevizos Alevizakos","I've got a broad question. Since you mentioned that a lot of your clients moved their money out of deposits and into active products, I'm wondering whether the percentage of your IB revenues have actually increased. And my main question is basically, since Wealth Management is presumably the largest client in the Investment Banking, what is the percent of the total IB revenues that are generated and actually belong effectively to the Wealth Management division?","Jonathan Pruzan","I'm not sure I follow the question so much, so let me just take a stab at what I think you're getting at. In terms of what we've seen in sort of the wealth network, the total sort of cash and money market and cash equivalent balances are down at sort of near-time lows. So it's not only deposits that people have been deploying into the markets, it's just sort of all their -- it's sort of all the cash and cash equivalent categories. There are clear synergies between our wealth business and our institutional businesses. But in terms of the amount of revenue that goes back and forth, I think that's an area that we think the businesses are complementary and they benefit each other, but we don't -- I wouldn't describe it in terms of the ways that you have. Clearly, having that distribution arm is good for a new issue product. It's good for certain structured products. So we continue to develop products that our wealth clients want. But again, the businesses are complementary and we don't measure it like that.","Alevizos Alevizakos","Sure. And as a follow-up question. At the moment, what are the 3 top products that you would say that your wealthy clients are getting out of your Investment Banking franchise?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, our clients -- we have an open platform. Our clients have access to products across all of the different investment opportunities. Clearly, some of our clients like the new issue product. As I said, we saw a lot of engagement with our clients with the cash and money market balances going down. And it looks like the proportion of invested assets and equities went up across the platform, so broadly speaking, equity product. They enjoy -- also there's structured products that some of the segments enjoy in terms of products that are tied to indices and other markets or other indexes or other rates around the world. But again, it's an open platform. It's a full-service platform. It is integrated with our institutional business, so there are some complementary -- complementarity to it. But again, I wouldn't describe it as the way you're describing it.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.","Devin Ryan","Maybe first one here, just within GWM, obviously a lot in the mix on the technology front with the robo platform and some of the goals-based technology being rolled out, which hopefully should attract new clients and expand the wall with existing clients. So can you remind us on the timing of maybe some of the key initiatives there? And then, just as digital becomes a bigger theme, I think, for the industry, how does Morgan Stanley think about when it's appropriate to build something that's proprietary versus partnering with outside FinTech?","Jonathan Pruzan","A couple different things. I would say, one, that sort of the digital strategy and the digital product rollout, I would say, broadly is on schedule. We're in beta testing with some of the products right now and are going to go out to the full network soon. So I would say, our investments around product are on schedule. When we think about digital, it's obviously a very important component to the overall franchise, but there's 2 components. There's a revenue component as well as an efficiency and automation component. I would suggest that a lot of the investments that we're making are going to help with the automation and efficiency of our branch network, which should lead to again better operating leverage in the business upfront and will also save time with our FAs and our CSAs, so they'll have more ability to spend time with clients.","But again, when we think about our wealth business, it's a business that's built on scale. And it's built on the fact that people with wealth want personal advice. So it's going to be both a mix of technology and digital with the personal element of the advice channel. And we think that's the winning formula going forward. But digital is important. It's on track. I would say the impact to the financial results are going to lag those investments. We'll see it probably first on the expense side and then later on the revenue side.","Devin Ryan","Yes. Got it, okay. Good color there. And then just follow-up here, maybe one around FIC and just bigger picture. When rates were low, I know many thought that as rates started to move, clients would increasingly reposition portfolios, so that would drive higher trading volumes. And I know you've spoken in the past around kind of Prime Brokerage client leverage. I'm sure it's still low. Are you seeing anything structurally holding back client risk-taking? Or do you just feel like it's simply just not enough buy-in on this market or the economic growth outlook? Just trying to think about kind of if there's something else structurally that's maybe within the leverage levels.","Jonathan Pruzan","Listen, I don't think it's structural. We've seen low volatility across many asset classes. We've seen a lack of sort of idiosyncratic events. When there is uncertainty, in some ways, that's -- or differences of opinions, that generates trading activity. We haven't seen a lot of that more recently. I think the underlying fundamentals sort of the global recovery, if you will, are pretty positive. But we haven't seen real dramatic changes in the rate profile. The 10-year treasury rebounded a little bit here recently. But given the geopolitical risk and the persistently low inflation numbers, it's a pretty tight trading band, FX rates, tight trading band, credit spreads, tight trading band. So again, I don't think it's structural. I think it's cyclical at this point. At some point, there will be catalysts to change the direction of the trading environment, and whether that's tax policy, whether that's better inflation data. But there will be something. And so this has been a sort of a subdued environment. I don't think it persists forever. But when and how that catalyst appears is clearly a question mark.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

This is Celeste Mellet Brown, Head of Investor Relations at Morgan Stanley. Welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Call.","Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements, which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.","The presentation may also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings at www.morganstanley.com for a reconciliation on such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley.","This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or investment.","I will now turn over the call to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James P. Gorman","Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, everyone. Ruth and I will now address our performance during the quarter.","As you're all aware, tremendous political uncertainty in the second quarter was detrimental to the global capital markets, resulting in a very challenging environment for all aspects of our business. Weak demand flows and difficult conditions contributed to results in sales and trading. The environment for investment banking was likewise affected by the market backdrop. However, we maintained our top-tier rankings in announced M&A and global IPOs as well as a leading position in global equities. We continued to have momentum in equity capital markets and recently won several significant lead mandates that should enhance earnings once the fog of macro uncertainty lifts.","GWM evidenced revenue and profitability resilience in a very challenging environment for retail investors. Despite the macro pressures that weighed on both retail engagement and new issue activity, revenues were commensurate with the prior quarter while margins improved to 12%, reflecting the benefits of the cost focus in that business.","We also reached a major milestone for Morgan Stanley in the wealth management industry with the culmination of the MSSB integration. The integration was substantially completed on July 8, and we can now finally look forward to the benefits of a fully harmonized business with significant scale. Our Wealth Management business will considerably increase its value to our clients and financial advisors through superior functionality and to our shareholders through enhanced and stable earnings.","Performance in traditional asset management held up and flows were again strong.","Finally, our results evidenced continued comp and non-comp expense discipline across the firm with expenses down 17% year-over-year.","We remain resolute in our commitment to maximize firm value and continue to shape our business for its success. There are 6 specific areas that represent new or continued steps in this regard, and I would now like to touch on each one. First, we persist in our efforts to optimize our balance sheet and business mix to best serve our clients. As you know, we have a strong Basel III capital ratio. We have reduced our Fixed Income and Commodities risk-weighted assets significantly since 2009 and by 15% alone since the end of the third quarter 2011. The reduction in risk-weighted assets has been driven by active management, including resolving legacy issues such as MBIA as well as passive runoff of all positions. We continue to reshape our Fixed Income businesses away from more complex structured product businesses to high-velocity, flow-oriented products. We intend to shrink these risk-weighted assets more dramatically through a combination of passive mitigation and active business unit management. By the end of 2013, we expect to drive fixed income risk-weighted assets to levels at least 25% below those at the third quarter 2011 and 30% below by the end of 2014, subject to final rules and regulatory changes. And we will continue to look for ways to drive additional value in this business.","As I've said repeatedly, we're driving towards the right set of Fixed Income businesses for Morgan Stanley, those that makes sense to our client footprint and complement our strong equities and banking franchises.","Second initiative. As I've also said before, we believe the scale economics and extraordinarily -- are extraordinarily important in wealth management as they are the key drivers to returns. As a result, we're taking steps to unlock value in our wealth management businesses outside of North America, starting with the recently completed Quilter sale. Across non-Japan Asia, we will align Wealth Management with the Institutional Equities and Investment Banking units to realize inherent cost synergies and revenue synergies among those businesses. We also have plans to align our Latin American Wealth Management business with our U.S. efforts. In doing so, these advisors and clients will move to the integrated platform, which now supports U.S.-based clients and allows us to further leverage the U.S. scale, service spreads and sophistication.","And finally and importantly, in the European Wealth Management business, we're considering an array of strategic alternatives to enhance profitability. These moves should be incremental to the improvements we've already discussed in the past in GWM.","Thirdly, we will remain vigilant in regards to all expenses as we have demonstrated over the past several quarters. Non-compensation expenses should further decline in the coming 12 months as expenses from the MSSB integration run off and as we actively manage our expense base across the rest of the firm.","Fourthly, we are focused on headcount and expect to end 2012 approximately 7% lower across the firm than the end of 2011, driven by a combination of previously announced reductions in force as well as applying a very high bar for replacing natural attrition.","Fifthly, our partnership with MUFG deepens every day and across all our businesses. We continue to work with our joint venture partners to identify opportunities to work together around the world. For example, in the second quarter, we and our partners executed a joint bridge loan facility for a leading diversified retailer in Latin America. Morgan Stanley then went on to act as an active joint book runner for the same company's IPO.","Sixth and finally, we expect to complete the acquisition of the next 14% of MSSB in September.","As is plainly evident in our results, the market and our circumstances were challenging in the second quarter. While it is still early days, we are seeing some signs of improvement in the third quarter.","I'll now turn it over to Ruth to take you through our earnings in detail.","Ruth Porat","Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures.","DVA in the quarter was positive $350 million with $74 million in equity sales and trading and $276 million in Fixed Income sales and trading.","Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were $6.6 billion, down 26% sequentially. Noninterest expenses were $6 billion, down 11% versus the first quarter. Compensation expenses were $3.6 billion this quarter, down 18% sequentially, reflecting not only our view for the quarter but also our financial outlook for the year. Non-compensation expenses were $2.4 billion, up 3% from last quarter, reflecting seasonality, but were down 9% year-over-year. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were approximately $312 million. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.16 after preferred dividends.","On a reported or GAAP basis, firm-wide revenues for the first quarter were $7 billion, roughly flat to last quarter. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were approximately $536 million. Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.28 after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was $31.02 per share. Tangible book value was $27.70 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet on Page 4 of the supplement. Total assets were $754 billion at June 30, down from $781 billion last quarter, reflecting lower levels of client activity. Our liquidity reserve was $173 billion at the end of the quarter versus $179 billion last quarter. Our liquidity levels reflected an additional $6.5 billion reduction in debt outstanding in the quarter and $21 billion in the last 12 months, as well as $2.9 billion of collateral outflows associated with recent ratings actions. Deposits were up again this quarter to $68 billion from $66 billion. Although our calculations are not final, we believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I will be approximately 13.5% and our Tier 1 capital ratio will be approximately 17.1%. Risk-weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately $317 billion at June 30. Subject to final rule-making but incorporating the recently codified Basel 2.5 guidance and our best estimate of the new Basel III NPR, our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was just under 8.5% as of the end of the second quarter, assuming full Basel III inflation of risk-weighted assets and 0 benefit from future mitigation. We expect that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III at the end of 2012 will be around 9%, reflecting continuing passive mitigation driven by position roll-off and consensus earnings with a modest benefit from the more active Fixed Income RWA management that James discussed.","Now turning to our businesses in detail. Unless otherwise noted, all discussion of income statement metrics and segment results will exclude DVA for the remainder of my remarks in order to differentiate revenues associated with our business from those associated with our borrowings that result solely from our credit spreads.","In Institutional Securities, revenues were $2.9 billion, down 42% sequentially. Noninterest expenses were $2.7 billion, down 18% versus the first quarter. The compensation ratio was 49%. Non-compensation expenses increased 6% from last quarter due to seasonality. The business reported a pretax profit of $158 million.","In Investment Banking, revenues of $884 million were up 4% versus last quarter. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked #1 in global IPOs, #2 in global announced M&A at the end of the second quarter. Notable transactions included, in equity underwriting, the $16 billion IPO for Facebook and the $3 billion IPO for Felda Global Ventures which are the 2 largest IPOs priced globally this year. In advisory, Anheuser-Busch InBev's $20 billion acquisition of Grupo Modelo SAB. And in debt underwriting, the $5 billion investment grade debt offering for GlaxoSmithKline capital.","Advisory revenues of $263 million were down 16% versus the first quarter, driven by lower fees across all regions. Equity underwriting revenues were $283 million, a 65% increase from the first quarter, reflecting stronger revenues in the Americas, partially offset by modest issuance levels in Europe. Fixed Income underwriting revenues of $338 million were down 8% versus last quarter, reflecting lower revenues from investment grade and high-yield issuance, partially offset by stronger loan syndication fees.","Equity sales and trading revenues were $1.14 billion, a decrease of 38% from last quarter. Results reflect challenging markets and lower industry-wide liquidity and volume. Despite lower volumes, our client franchise remains strong as evidenced by increased market share across most products. Prime brokerage revenues increased sequentially and at a faster rate than balance growth.","Fixed Income and Commodities sales and trading revenues were $770 million. Revenues were down 70% versus our strong first quarter results. Results in the quarter primarily reflect a challenging market and lower levels of client activity. Results also reflect meaningfully lower revenues from commodities after a strong first quarter that included a number of structured solutions for clients. Finally, results include period-specific items associated with the ratings action of approximately $225 million.","The other sales and trading line reflects negative revenues of $11 million compared with negative $286 million last quarter. Included in other sales and trading net revenue is the net positive impact of $76 million for adjustments related to certain derivative positions not qualifying as hedges of net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries.","Turning to VAR. Our average aggregated VAR by primary risk category for the quarter was $81 million versus $72 million in the first quarter and $135 million in the prior year. Period-end total VAR was $85 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $78 million at the end of the first quarter. Average total VAR was $91 million this quarter versus $84 million in the first quarter using a 4-year data series.","Turning to Global Wealth Management. Revenues of $3.3 billion were down 3% versus the prior quarter, driven primarily by lower retail activity. Asset management revenues were up 7%, benefiting from higher asset levels at the end of the first quarter. Transactional revenues declined 19% from last quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $531 million, which decreased 16% from last quarter, reflecting low levels of client activity, Investment Banking-related fees of $223 million, which increased 9% versus last quarter, driven by particularly strong activity in closed-end funds and trading revenues of $222 million, which were down 40% versus the first quarter, reflecting markdowns in deferred compensation plans.","Noninterest expenses were $2.9 billion, down 4% from last quarter. The compensation ratio was 60% versus 62% in the first quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $918 million, flat to the last quarter. Expenses related to the integration were $79 million in the quarter and will decline from here.","Profit before tax was $393 million while the PBT margin was 12%, up from last quarter despite a decline in revenues, reflecting our expense control efforts in this business. The $61 million gain from discontinued operations after-tax includes a $108 million pretax gain from the previously announced sale of Quilter. NCI for the quarter was $81 million, up slightly from $74 million in the first quarter. NCI this quarter includes $8 million related to Quilter.","Total client assets decreased slightly to $1.7 trillion due to market depreciation. Global fee-based asset inflows were $4 billion. Fee-based assets under management declined to $526 billion at quarter end due to market depreciation but were up 6% year-over-year. Global representatives at quarter end were 16,934.","Bank deposits were $112 billion at the end of the quarter with approximately $58 billion held in Morgan Stanley banks. As James mentioned, we have reached a major milestone in this business. The integration was substantially completed 2 weeks ago when we moved the final wave of Smith Barney Financial Advisors onto the new platform. The final transition was executed on plan. In the 3 waves of legacy Smith Barney Financial Advisor and client migration that started in February, we transferred over $900 billion in assets, 7 years of transaction history comprised of approximately 2 billion documents and over 47 million client positions.","Additionally, the transition included significant training for employees moving onto the new platform, which enhances both the financial advisor and client experience.","Asset Management revenues of $456 million were down from $533 million in the first quarter, due primarily to lower valuations. In Traditional Asset Management, revenues of $337 million were flat compared to the first quarter. In Real Estate Investing, revenues of $122 million were down 16% versus last quarter. Due to the ownership structure of these funds, the majority of these revenues are passed to third-party investors in the noncontrolling interest line. In Merchant Banking, revenues were negative $3 million compared with positive $45 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by markdowns in Asia. Compensation expense was $214 million in the quarter, down from $218 million in the first quarter. Profit before tax was $43 million, down from $128 million last quarter. NCI was $23 million versus $65 million last quarter. And total AUM increased to $311 billion, driven by net inflows of $13 billion, partially offset by market depreciation.","In conclusion, results in the second quarter reflect a challenging market backdrop. We expect markets will continue to be affected by slow global growth and the challenges in the Eurozone. However, some of the more Morgan Stanley-specific issues are receding and we look forward to more business-as-usual performance. As James commented at the outset, we are further driving returns in our business through actions including ongoing emphasis on capital optimization, leveraging economies of scale and wealth management, driving further expense and headcount reduction and creating greater efficiencies in funding.","With respect to business trends in the near to medium term, we expect activity levels to remain highest in the Americas followed by Asia. We expect the challenges in Europe will continue to weigh on activity levels in the near term. However, we look forward to normalcy in Europe at some point given the strength of our franchise there. And when the discussion about outlook is more about economic growth and less about political risks, there's further operating leverage in the business. In Investment Banking, we continue to benefit from our leadership positions and have a healthy pipeline. In our trading businesses, we are becoming more effective by leveraging adjacencies across products and clients as well as investments in technology. In retail wealth management, we are pleased to have all of our financial advisors integrated on one platform.","Thank you for listening, and James and I will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Roger Freeman with Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess -- thanks for your comments on what you think some of the sort of direct impact of the Moody's downgrade was. Have you seen -- was most of that, that you could quantify, before the actual downgrades or after and have you seen any change in behavior as the full impact of this has settled in?","Ruth Porat","So there are a couple of pieces to it. The portion that I quantified, the $225 million, came after the Moody's downgrade. So to be clear, it was associated with valuation allowances and contract adjustments. There are a couple of items we can't quantify. For example, our bankers spend a lot of time with clients and counter-parties throughout the period, addressing questions they may have had and that's time which otherwise would have been spent capturing new business. And as the quarter wore on with increasing speculation on rates, on the ratings outcome, some clients seemed to take a wait-and-see approach. So those are tougher to quantify but we certainly felt, in particular given the elongated deliberation process, that it did weigh towards the end of the quarter. Overall, with the ratings action on the sector finally resolved, we are seeing real relief and clients have reengaged. It's helpful to have that uncertainty addressed.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And has there been any utilization of clients, particularly like pension funds, that are kind of more sensitive to transacting with the bank?","Ruth Porat","So if you're asking, has much gone into the derivative sub, there's not much of note. We have seen an acceleration of foreign exchange into the bank. We've seen -- we've been writing more new foreign exchange business in the bank.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question on this topic. The collateral postings, it looks like you've posted a little less than half of what you're potentially obligated to. Is that just a function of the other half not having been called?","Ruth Porat","So we posted the $2.9 billion. Just to give you an update on the total collateral subject to call, it's actually a bit lower than in our first quarter Q. We had an estimate of $6.8 billion in the first quarter. It's now ballpark around $6.3 billion. I think it's fair to say that we've been pleased with the pace of call, it's just been very measured, which, in our view, underscores that clients have comfort, real comfort, with the firm. Since the end of the quarter, in July, we've had another $800 million called. But again this pace does seem to be quite measured. We do expect more to be called going forward. Hard to forecast how much that is, but as we've talked about on prior calls, we are fully reserved for the full amount of potential collateral call and the sizing of our liquidity reserve.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right, okay. And just last question overall. The -- you talked about some of the -- some initiatives, streamlining within the units, focus on headcount. Any rough quantifications, maybe given current sort of run rates, what that -- what impact or benefit they're going to have to run rate expenses?","Ruth Porat","No.","Operator","The next question will come from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","James, on Fixed Income, the targets you mentioned at the beginning of the call appear like a meaningful strategic shift on the rebuild that, again, before you took the helm. The RWA targets are interesting, but it'd be really helpful to just hear exactly what and where you want the firm to be in the Fixed Income businesses today and how quickly you want to get there, and maybe what were some of the drivers of that thinking if, in fact, you agree with what I'm saying.","James P. Gorman","Sure, I'll let Ruth some of the targets on where we are and then I'll let you know where we're going to end up.","Ruth Porat","So the focus is continuing to be on fixed income optimization. As Colm and Kenny have talked about for quite some time, they focus on share capital efficiency and cost structure, and we're focused on ensuring that our footprint is consistent with what we need to do strategically. So we have a cohesive suite of products that is consistent with the strength we have across our platform, beginning with Investment Banking, what we're doing on the institutional equities side and a number of areas within Fixed Income. But there are certain businesses within the Fixed Income that may be nice to have, but they're not necessary and they're RWA-intensive and that's really what James was getting at in the reduction in risk-weighted assets that we're focused on driving. So down 15% from the third quarter to the second quarter, targeting being down 25% in aggregate by 2013 and we're really targeting active business unit management. So this essentially doubles the RWA reduction from the business. I think the other point is as we reduce more complex areas, it's not just the capital benefit, but there's a funding benefit and an expense benefit as well.","James P. Gorman","Yes, I'd just add I sort of see it as a couple of different chapters. The first was we had some legacy positions that, for the last couple of years we've had to deal with, and you have to deal with that artfully. You don't want to take unnecessary pain and we've worked our way out of those positions. I think the most significant, obviously, was the Republic of Italy and the MBIA exposures and so on. The second is that we've been building our footprint on the flow side of the business, which also has been a couple of years in the working. And the third is now adjusting the focus on particularly the heavier risk-weighted asset businesses, which we have been and increasingly have been more aggressive on and are reflective of the environment and the world as we see it going forward. We've consistently said that our focus is going to be on the flow, high-velocity, lighter risk-weighted asset businesses. And if anything, that focus has been -- the dial has been turned up on that.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. Understood, that's helpful. Just on the FID RWA reduction targets, I just want to confirm that's on Basel III basis. And then for starting point purposes, what's the FID RWA today on Basel III, Ruth?","Ruth Porat","That is on a Basel III basis and we -- what we've been doing is guiding to an overall Basel III ratio, not breaking out RWAs by business for the firm.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. The reason I asked, I guess, is if FID is the majority of the firm's RWA and let's just say it's $300 billion and you put 10% equity against that, that's $30 billion and that's larger than the market cap of the company today. I'm just curious, is there -- where are you, James and Ruth, in terms of more transformational thinking within the business because that just seems incorrect in my opinion.","Ruth Porat","Well I guess there are a couple of points in there. Our risk-weighted assets, obviously, are across the business, GWM, our MSIM business, in the lending business and smaller, obviously, in institutional equities. So we're trying to give you a sense of the decline in risk-weighted assets or more important strategically what we're driving within our Fixed Income business.","James P. Gorman","I would add to it, Howard. I understand exactly what you're saying. If all the risk-weighted assets and capital are tied up in that business, why wouldn't we be more aggressive? I think what Ruth is saying is it's not quite as simple as that. We have risk-weighted assets and capital tied up across the firm. That said, in the areas where it is most lumpy and has generated the least returns, we are being the most aggressive and will be increasingly so. It's a balancing act here of not throwing the baby out with the bath water. We have some great businesses within Fixed Income and we had obviously a very difficult quarter. There's no -- we're not going to hide from that in Fixed Income. It's a tough quarter and a disappointing quarter. But we have some great businesses within there and we need to manage that very, very carefully going forward, which is what we're doing.","Operator","The next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So it was helpful to hear that the business is clearly impacted by the potential action from Moody's and given that clients have reengaged was hoping maybe you could help us think about how the quarter progressed, right? Things seem to have got drawn out by Moody's in June. And so was June particularly rough and was a lot of the impact focused in FICC? Can you help us think about just year-over-year how all of that look?","Ruth Porat","You're absolutely right. I think the elongation of the deliberation really just started to weigh on us, clients, counter-parties as it dragged on. And June, you just felt it was -- whether it was fatigue, waiting, it was -- we just certainly felt it weighing as we got towards the end of the quarter, and we're pleased that it finally was resolved. And I think it was exacerbated by the ongoing concerns about the Eurozone and just led to speculation about what the ratings outcome might be. And as I said, clients seemed to take this wait-and-see approach, but it got heavier as it ended. And finally, the third week in June finally resolved. So we have seen a real release, as I said, and it was primarily affecting the Fixed Income business. And so not only did you have the weight of kind of clients' wait-and-see plus our bankers focused on trying to ensure they had what they needed, but then the $225 million as we have the collateral at that last week or 1.5 weeks of the month come out.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. So if we -- I mean just looking at that sort of 9 95 [ph], assuming thats the sort of adjusted x DVA FICC for that 225, if we make assumptions that, okay, June was really weak and then we run rate that, it looks like x June, things were sort of closer to the back half of 2011. The reason I'm asking or trying to get at this is I'm trying to get at what the actual run rate really was in the quarter x this unusual onetime event, which now is -- as we all know is clearly behind you.","Ruth Porat","Right. Well, there were a couple of things. There was the macro backdrop and you've added obviously the 225 back appropriately. I think the other thing that I noted was our commodities was much weaker. It tends to be a lumpy business. We called it out on prior quarters because it's a mix of both flow and structured solutions for clients. We had a number of structured solutions for clients last quarter. We didn't have any this quarter. So the drag was exacerbated by the lower results there as well.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on equities, I noticed that VAR ticked up and the results were not so terrific. Were there any positional losses there, or is there any color in equities on that font?","Ruth Porat","No. Actually, VAR -- just to address that, VAR was up modestly versus last quarter. It was really more in the rates line. But I would say we're continuing to run at historically low levels. If I point you back to the same period last quarter and if you look at that line aggregation of primary risk category, so it takes out the noise from MBIA last year, we were at the $135 million of VAR last year, down to $81 million this past quarter. And so we're still running at low levels relative to the past prior years, and we think that's very prudent. That's the way we're running the business. So wanted just to make sure we were clear on that. And then with respect to equities, when you see the trading histogram for the firm overall, it moved a bit to the left, but we did not have trading losses there. We're profitable across the businesses it was just lower levels of activity.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then how about PB? Did you -- was there the similar themes to what you highlighted as far as the downgrade where there was a great deal of lost productivity and such in that business?","Ruth Porat","Actually in our prime brokerage business, revenues were up, clients were up and balances were up. And as I noted in my opening comments, revenues outpaced balance growth. So we felt very good about that business.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's great. Okay, last one for me. If we could just get a feel for what net new assets were in the quarter and maybe if we could put in a request to reconsider disclosing that number. I know that you guys are focused on the fee-paying accounts, but just -- it'd be helpful just to get a sense of risk appetite among retail investors and the folks that are in the transactional business.","Ruth Porat","The reason we moved to disclosing managed money is that's the way Greg Fleming and the team are running the business and we think it gives you a better indication of the results in the business. So that's where we're managing it and that's why that's what we're disclosing.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Any chance to know what the net new assets were this quarter?","Ruth Porat","I don't have them with me.","Operator","The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","A quick one on Commodities first. You mentioned twice the no-structured solutions in the quarter. Curious if you think that's a function of just flat out lower prices and less incentive to hedge on behalf of clients?","Ruth Porat","No, as I mentioned, it tends to be a lumpy business and this quarter there were fewer of them. We expect the forward quarters there will be some more. We're just not going to -- we don't forecast when they come. So at this point, no.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess the broader question on FICC and apologize to both if I'm misinterpreting this. What I heard was the strategy is pretty similar to the past. You've put a lot of the legacy issues behind or if not all of them. The strategy sounds very similar. It's that you were going to run a much tighter ship on -- lower RWA and tighter on costs in FICC, which I think is what people do want. I just don't know if you had the same level of confidence in the ability to take share and grow revenues in that business. So somewhere in there is a question, I apologize.","Ruth Porat","No, there was a lot in there. Look, as I said Colm and Kenny have been focused on share capital efficiency and cost discipline. And we put in place tight governance around RWA management, so that we can drive down those RWA improvements that James articulated. And that's still with the notion, the key driving factor being what's the strategic suite of products that we need to have the strength in our core franchise. And so, again, what -- you'll see real rigor there and it's not about -- we look at the business not about how big it is, but about what's the returns in the business and are we placed and positioned where we want to be strategically. I think the other thing that we're doing is continuing to leverage not just client strength and market share positions across our franchise, but we're also leveraging what we're doing on the technology side. So there's a lot of talk about electronification in the market and we're benefiting from, for example, the leading MSET platform that we have on the equities side. And what that does is it helps both execution and analytics. So on the execution side, where we're focused -- and I've talked about this on a number of prior calls, markets with discontinuities and rapid throughput, very much in the foreign exchange market. I've talked about the increasing gains that we've had there. Derivatives also benefits. We're using or can use our MSET passport products to see what's in the SEF to place orders. And we've talked a lot about our commitment to central clearing and how we've invested there and you've seen some early wins with clients. And technology also, on the analytic side, helps improve service. So, for example, transaction cost analysis is something that we think is valuable. So what we're doing is providing clients with greater transparency and hopefully liquidity. But the main point here is we're leveraging a real asset we have on the institutional equities side to the benefit of where the Fixed Income market is going and we're rightsizing what we're doing on the Fixed Income side similarly to play off of the strengths we have within Institutional Securities.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Last one, on comp. Obviously, comp ratios get amplified when revenues have a tough time, and this is a tough time. But it also makes me think that sometimes there's a certain floor and so let's maybe just stick with Institutional Securities. I hate using that word, but is there a certain level that comp can't really go below without something bigger happening? And maybe if you could comment on the impact of prior period deferreds.","Ruth Porat","So the way we look at comp is we look at it really again through all the levers we have to control to manage the compensation expense as efficiently as possible. We -- and so we accrue to an estimate for the full year. Obviously, we're only halfway through the year, and relatively strong quarters like last quarter we can accrue more dollars and it's at lower rates. But that shows really the operating leverage and a better environment. And then in tough quarters like this we reduce dollars and that underscores the cost discipline. But the way we think about is we want to drive returns, we want to ensure we can the pay people who are driving returns and we need to make sure that we're doing all that we can to use those compensation dollars most efficiently. That's why we talked about headcount reductions. That's why we established the Office of Re-engineering to do things like continue to drive location sourcing, moving people who don't need to be in centers like New York City to places like our Baltimore outsource location here in the States. So again, it's a number of levers that help us drive down what's that fixed cost component of it and how do we manage overall the compensation expense.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Just one last important one is, your Basel III is better than everybody else for the most part. How will you use that to benefit you? In other words, you're going through the process with MSSB now. There's going to be a price whether you agree on it or it goes through arbitration. How do you balance accelerating the rest of MSSB or buying back stock if it has a tangible book? What's a better Basel III going to do for you?","Ruth Porat","We think what a better Basel III and strong capital ratios do for us now is underscore the strength of the franchise. What we've done with capital and what we've done with liquidity are both, as I've called them in the past, really a fortified foundation and that's a positive for the firm. We think that, over time, that will continue to give us greater flexibility with options to return capital to shareholders in -- with the kind of uncertainty in the macro environment. I think where we are today is very prudent and with the strategic opportunity in front of us, as you said, we have the immediate use of capital. But overall, accreting capital gives us degrees of flexibility.","Operator","The next question will come from Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you just briefly discuss NPR2. If that's on an internal basis or standardized basis? And within that risk-weighted asset Basel III, Basel 2.5 framework, can you also maybe give us a bit of an indication of how large your market risk-weighted assets are at this point considering the rules are finalized?","Ruth Porat","Sure. So there's a lot in that question as well. Why don't I start with, first, building up our spot in 2012 Basel III and then I'll go to the standardized approach and hopefully can get most of your questions in that. What we try to do is guide conservatively based on our best estimates of the rules as they continue to evolve. So at the end of the first quarter, we guided to a spot of 8% to 9% and obviously the Basel 2.5 rules weren't final at that point. And as I said then, the high end of the range assumed the international version of Basel 2.5 and the low end assumed our best assessment of the most likely worst case interpretation of Basel 2.5 NPR. And with 2.5 now done, codified, we ended up essentially in the midpoint of the range. But since then, the Basel III NPR rules were also introduced and we're focused on both the numerator and the denominator and that's what led us to our best estimate for spot, at the end of the second quarter was just under 8.5%. And as I said, that's full Basel III inflation, no mitigation. In other words, our second quarter earnings were more than offset by our assessment of the change in rules under Basel III NPR and that flows through as we roll forward to the end of 2012, approximately 9% by year-end 2012. And then, as it relates to your question about the standardized approach, I think there are 2 questions that keep coming up on standardized approach, one being about the Collins floor, and we are well above the minimum, which is obviously what the test is about. But I think, what you're really getting at is the impact on the correlation book under CRM model approval. So assuming we had model approval, our Tier 1 common ratio would be about 40 basis points higher assuming the book remains the same size it is as at the end of the second quarter. We are obviously working hard to get model approval, but we have not included the benefit of model approval in the numbers we've given you given the timing around -- even when you receive here our model approval, you have to wait a year to see the benefit. So to the extent -- I leave it to you whether you add that 40 basis points onto the guidance that I've given you, but we did not include the 40 basis points in our guidance.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's very detailed. The second question is regarding CVA. You mentioned you have another $800 million of -- first of all, the $2.9 billion of collateral that you have to put up, can I put that in relation to the $225 million CVA charge and can I then use that to, very simplistically, say, okay, there's another $800 million that you've done on the third quarter, maybe that's even going up, i.e., it's something like $13 million -- for every $13 million of collateral you're putting up roughly $1 million of CVA. Should we assume basically further CVA impact in the third quarter? And what I'm doing, is that correct, $225 million where there's $2.9 billion?","Ruth Porat","Well, the most important point is that we're working to risk-mitigate any additional impact. And so I don't want to suggest there that you can do this straight-through extension. I think your proxy looking at the $225 million relative to the $2.9 billion, I'll leave that to you. But it's not all a valuation allowance. As we said it's a valuational -- it's primarily a valuation allowance. There were some contract adjustments, so it's a bit less than what you've looked at there.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And should you move to CCP some of the collateral? I assume you still have to put up CVA so far based on the proposal so far. So that shouldn't really help you. What I'm trying to understand is how could you mitigate this additional -- the additional charges?","Ruth Porat","Yes, we're working through a number of different execution paths there.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Lastly, on FICC. I hate to come back to that question of the risk-weighted asset reductions. The way I understand is you want to reduce capital-intensive businesses. These are normally your strong business, i.e., if I look on the Basel III and 2.5, that's commodities and credits, which historically was -- in FICC, have been your strong businesses. Can you talk a little bit about the revenue impact? And can you be maybe a little bit more specific also on the impact -- does it -- is it actually exiting certain business lines within these areas? Or is it maybe some geographical impact that we should be expecting from this?","Ruth Porat","We've highlighted in the past the areas that are heavy RWA and actually can be heavy funding requirements as well, but heavy RWA that aren't within that very tight strategic circle that I talked about, that James talked about. And they would really include structured credit and sub-investment grade securitization so we're still -- we have -- we're still active in various parts of the mortgage market. But there are parts of it -- some investment grade where we can reduce what we're doing, structure credit the same. I would say that commodities and credit, as you've indicated, are strong business is credit, being one of our strongest and very central to that strategic circle I talked about and similarly commodities has had strength over many years. So I'll point you back to prior comments consistently regarding the other areas.","Operator","The next question will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The first question I have relates to the drop in corporate lending commitments. I'm just curious as to -- if you can provide some color as to what's going on there. Does that imply a substantially lower risk appetite, or was there a specific transaction that got done? Or could you provide some color on that?","Ruth Porat","No, we have continued lending. I think that what I'd point you to is our growth in HFI -- and I want to make sure you're looking at the entire picture, we have been increasing HFI balances. They're up meaningfully about 40% of our lending book now. I don't want to suggest that the rate of growth you've seen in the first half of the year is what you'll continue to see. We obviously moved to HFI. And I think that's Page 8 in the supplement. If you look at the 2 pieces combined, you'll see that we continue to be active there. And as James said, we're very pleased with what we're able to continue to do with our partner, MUFG, and there's a real power to the combination through our lending activities together.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I would just like to follow up on the higher value at risk in terms of the interest rate and credit spread numbers. Is there -- was that due to volatility in the quarter, or was there something else going on there? Sorry for reiterating an earlier question, but...","Ruth Porat","No, that's fine. It's really just due to the mix of client activity and market volatility. But again, I'd point you to where it has run over the prior 3 years and it continues to be -- we continue to run it at lower levels.","Operator","The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","I'm just trying to reconcile 2 of your goals; one goal from, at least, last year, if not more recently, is to increase the market share in the Fixed Income trading business from 6% to 8% and reconcile that with the new target to reduce risk-weighted assets by 30% by the end of 2014. If those 2 goals collide, which one is more important?","Ruth Porat","Well, as I said, we're focused on share and capital efficiency and cost discipline, and we're continuing to drive share and share growth in areas that stay within that strategic circle. I keep coming back to that term for lack of a better one. But, for example, our rates business was up year-over-year. We've invested in it, it's a core part of the franchise. Corporate credit, as we have already talked about, is a key part of the business. So when we're looking and defining the businesses that are RWA-heavy, and in fact, it very much goes to the opportunities that we see in other areas, then it's about increased balance sheet velocity, which Colm and Kenny and all of us have talked about for quite some time that we're driving in our flow business. And so returns are most important. We're not going for size for size's sake, but we see that in the areas in which we're competing, we have opportunity for additional share growth and that's what we're driving, again leveraging the strength across Institutional Securities.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","So a little bit of an evolution, more toward returns as opposed to growth?","Ruth Porat","That's probably fair to say.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And then I'm looking at Page 5 of the supplement. And you have $22 billion of your Tier 1 capital allocated to Institutional Securities. That's a little bit over 1\/2 of the total firm. And my question is when it comes to trading businesses or Fixed Income trading businesses, are you reducing risk-weighted assets enough? I mean you're penalized by the regulators, you're penalized by the rating agencies, you're probably penalized by investors to some degree. And a lot of these securities will be traded electronically, if everything goes to plan. So why not reduce the risk-weighted assets more dramatically?","Ruth Porat","And that is what we're doing. As I said, we have governance around driving risk-weighted assets down. We're going to continue to drive them down while, again, balancing what we believe drives the greatest returns for all of our stakeholders going back to A, what's the strategic lens; and B, what else can we be doing leveraging technology and other strengths in the business. But we are very, I think, consistent with what you're asking, driving RWAs down and have a governance process around that to deliver lower RWAs where we don't -- where we feel it's most appropriate.","James P. Gorman","And I think, Mike, I mean what becomes dramatically if we're down 30% from the third quarter of '11 in risk-weighted assets by the end of '13, that's obviously a very significant shift. We've taken a lot of capital out of the merchant banking businesses and we'll continue doing that consistent with the Volcker Rule. All the prop businesses that we've exited, few little stakes that we have in different pieces that have been floating around, the strategic investments made every -- part of the last decade or so we've been slowly working our way out of, but we don't want to do it where we're taking unnecessarily damage -- unnecessarily damaging ourselves. So there is underneath this, if you aggregate the pieces, I would argue a pretty significant transformation. But we've also got to be mindful, as I think you pointed out earlier, we're balancing obviously revenues in some very strong businesses within Fixed Income and sales and trading with exiting on a prudent, sort of not patient, an aggressive timetable, but not a reckless timetable.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And then last follow-up. So if Institutional Securities takes up 1\/2 of your capital today, where do you think that might be 3 to 5 years from now, a fourth, a third?","James P. Gorman","I don't know you whether we want to wing that.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","But less?","James P. Gorman","Yes, obviously. The capital makes it look whole corporation's coming down. We hold a lot of capital at the parent level where, as Ruth pointed out under Basel III, we're, I guess, a tad below or somewhere below 8.5. We feel like on any comparative measure -- I mean it's one thing to have to go and raise capital and maybe have high returns in the short run versus having low returns and having the capital already in-house, and that's the position we're in. And over time, as we restructure, bring down the risk-weighted assets, obviously we'll get much more active on the capital management side, which is what something I know all shareholders, including us, are looking forward to doing.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First on the MSSB business. If the integration costs are going to start coming down in the next couple of quarters, does anything change on your margin outlook? And I guess, more importantly, you mentioned a lot of other things kind of outside the U.S. that you're working on, I mean using the U.S. as generating more efficiencies. So does anything change if we're still in this rate environment? Or do you still need rates and market as a tailwind to get to that longer-term 20%?","Ruth Porat","So the mid-teens margin by mid-next year is the -- we're still on track for that and that was predicated upon the integration being done and integration-related expenses coming off, so there's no news in that. The discussion we have -- are having regarding what we're doing with our International Wealth Management businesses are modestly additive to that mid-teens by mid-next year target. And as we look at the longer-term higher target it's still predicated on a lift from rates or equity markets. As we've talked about 50 basis points in said funds is 1 point on PBT margin, and at some point, rates will revert to the mean. So that is still additive. But that is how we build it up over time. Still very much on track and the International Wealth Management is modestly additive.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then on the expenses. As part of that reengineering effort, the $1.4 billion, does that take into consideration everything that you're talking about on the fixed side in terms of reducing the risk-weighted assets, reducing the cost or would that be incremental? And then on top of that, just given the environment and given that $1.4 billion kind of target through 2014, has anything changed to force that up or anything more material?","Ruth Porat","So the Office of Re-engineering was set up quite some time ago to look at reengineering bigger parts of the business like what are we doing with technology structure and outsourcing or legal entity consolidation, things like that. We're very much on track for the $500 million run rate excess from this year and $1.4 billion that we talked about. What we've discussed today and the benefit of this incremental drive on non-comp expense is additive to the Office of Re-engineering. So I think a simple way to think about it is there's the Office of Re-engineering. There are the ongoing tactical expense initiatives that we've talked about and this adds -- the added drive on non-comp, comp-related items adds to our savings. And to be clear, in the Office of Re-engineering there is a component that's compensation and non-compensation related because we're fundamentally reengineering certain parts of the business. But the items that James went through this morning are additive.","James P. Gorman","And I think that, to be fair, the bar for incremental expenses for things that are not obviously investments driving really visible revenues is extremely high. We're -- like everybody else in the banking industry at the moment, there are a limited number of things you can control about the external environment. So we're controlling what we spend very carefully, and we'll continue to so.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, 2 items that are  typically unforecastable. But the other sales and trading just x the adjustment this quarter expect to go back to that run rate loss? And then on the tax rate, same thing, a bit lower? A lot of moving pieces this quarter but expect it to go back to more -- a normal level?","Ruth Porat","Well, as you said, the other sales and trading is hard to forecast because there are a lot of different items in that line item. With respect of the tax rate, I can hopefully give you a little more guidance although the tax rate's obviously a function of geographic mix. But we would guide to still approximately 30% in the third quarter. But as I said it's a function of geographic mix and the second quarter was affected by the estimate of full year DVA, so that moves around as well. But best estimate at this point, for what it's worth, is 30%.","Operator","The final question will come from Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just wanted to focus in a little bit more on the Global Wealth business. Looks like it's a little bit trickier quarter for some of the metrics. The brokerage headcount, and I guess, the percentage of assets with -- the percentage of brokers with wealthy clients. How much of this is sort of related to sort of this sort of being the final integration? Or I mean is there something else that maybe you guys can address, or was it really just sort of the all the uncertainty around the ratings and things like that? If you could address that, that'd be helpful.","Ruth Porat","Thank you. So we've talked over the last several quarters about focusing on the quality rather than the quantity of financial advisors. And the number is down this quarter, but again consistent with that strategic prioritization. Where we really focus is what's the retention of our top performers and the attrition in our top 2 quintiles is consistent with prior quarters, which we view as a positive, very much to your question about the impact of platform integration. Given the low attrition while going through platform integration we do view that as a real positive because human nature is people don't like change. The way the team is managing it is to do what they can to increase the productivity of financial advisors, and I think one very good example is the way they restructured the training programs. So we have reduced the number of trainees, incoming trainees, from 2,000 down to 1,250. And the view is that, that does quite a number of things for us. One, it raises the bar on the group that we bring into train. It allows us to do a much deeper job training them. We attach them to mentors and branches. And overall, we've seen a 30% increase in the success rate. So reduce the incoming number of people, not only is that helpful overall for the incoming people but -- and their productivity, but also non-compensation expenses benefit because we have fewer people coming in. But this is just an example of the types of things we're doing to focus on productivity and quality rather than the number. And in terms of the AUM for the $1 million-plus that you noted, what we see is kind of more seasonal pattern that anything. It's drifted down in the last several years in the second quarter as well.","Douglas Sipkin - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, great. And then could you guys provide any more specifics about guidance around integration charges for the remainder of the year? I know you guys mentioned it'd be coming down, but could you put any hard numbers do that in either Q3 or Q4 or just for the second half?","Ruth Porat","Well, historically they were running in the $80 million to $100 million area. It was $80 million in the second quarter. It does decline -- I'm not going to do a flag quantifying what that will be in the third or fourth quarter. But it comes down through the next several quarters for the obvious reason, done with integration. But we are running a number of things in parallel. So for example, data retention, we're continuing to keep people employed to ensure we're doing the right things with respect to data quality. We're also continuing training in the field. And we also have software capitalization kicking in. So we've got a number of additional items that's somewhat down.","James P. Gorman","I think just to add to that, that the mix, as Ruth said, is changing from building the technology to training the people to use it to capitalizing the software that it's based upon. So that's sort of a mix change. And I think the third quarter, obviously with the transaction we'll be doing with Citibank, will be a little messier as we get through that, but the outlook is clearly the mix change and the volume change.","Celeste Mellet Brown","All right. Thank you so much for joining our second quarter call, and we look forward to speaking to you again in October.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call.

In the second quarter 2014, we again grew our earnings on a year-over-year basis excluding DVA and excluding a discrete tax benefit in the quarter earnings increased 46%.","The fruits of our strategy were evident, with the stability of our wealth and asset management businesses providing significant ballast. The trust and partnership we have with our clients in investment banking and institutional equities offset historically low levels of volatility and reduced client activity. Our role has a strategic advisor for clients across our franchise including M&A, prime brokerage, credit, research and other deep content rich businesses positions us to benefit significantly from accelerating positive trends.","I will now take you through the six points we laid out for you in January. And then turn the call over to Ruth.","First, we continue to improve wealth management margins through cost discipline and revenue growth. For the first time since the acquisition from Citi, the remaining stake in the wealth management JV, we have achieved a greater than 20% margin in our wealth management business and record earnings since its inception of the joint venture.","We reached this level through a combination of revenue growth; our revenues grew 5% on a year-over-year basis despite reduced industry-wide transaction activity and continued expense discipline. We drove our non-compensation expenses down by 9% during the same period and our total expenses grew only 3%. We continue to expect to drive our margin to the 22% to 25% target set for the end of 2015.","Second, we have improved our ROE in fixed income and commodities and continue to optimize that business to be appropriately sized for this firm. Although, our revenues excluding DVA were flat in the first half of 2014, we have also reduced average RWAs and expenses thereby increasing ROE in this business year-to-date.","At the end of the second quarter 2014, our RWAs in fixed income and commodities were $192 billion. In addition to this systemic reduction of dead weight capital, more broadly, we have taken significant steps in commodities to improve returns.","We closed on the sale of TransMontaigne on July 1st, the first of two physical oil businesses we are selling and continue to work towards closing the sale of the other physical business later this year. And as discussed at our financials conference in early June, we are optimizing headcount and reducing grossed up balance sheet in fixed income, while maintaining a global franchise by leveraging our clearing and electronic capabilities. Our objective remains to deliver a global offering to the firm\u2019s clients and an attractive return for shareholders.","Third, we are driving additional expense reductions and improvements in our expense ratios. In the first half of 2014, we grew our expenses by 3%, while \u2013 grew our revenues by 3% while keeping expenses flat. Our non-compensation expenses have declined while the firm-wide compensation ratio is also lower. In aggregate, overall expense ratios have improved from 79% to 76% compared to the first half of 2013. We continue to see opportunities to increase efficiency through both tactical and strategic moves, investing in technology and systems that simplify our business and position us to better serve our clients.","Fourthly, we continue to make progress regarding Morgan Stanley\u2019s specific growth output opportunities most notably in the bank. In the last several months, we drew new production records in both mortgages and securities based lending despite sluggish demand for mortgages across the industry. Our success has been driven by the relatively low penetration of our product within wealth management versus peer firms. We have seen a network effect build within our system as financial advisors use the products and find them effective for their clients; they discuss opportunities with additional clients, the successes of them being shared throughout the system leading to more activity.","As we have said before, lending growth will enhance the stability of revenue and earnings for the firm as a whole and make our client relationships deeper and stickier. Of great importance to us, however, is that we grow our banks in a prudent and measured fashion. We have known since 2009 that we would have a very significant deposit base. And we spent the last five years investing in risk management, technology and client service.","Turning to the fifth point. We continue to steadily increase capital return to shareholders. We discussed our plans for capital returns with you on our last call in extensive detail. And we remain committed to increasing returns over time subject of course to regulatory approval. Of note, a key driver of capital returns are stable and consistent earnings, which we continue to demonstrate this quarter.","Finally, we are working towards achieving returns in excess of our cost of capital and of course, subject to our capital returns. We did achieve our target of 10% this quarter that was obviously flattered by the discrete tax benefit. However, excluding DVA in the first half of this year and last year and excluding the tax benefit of this quarter, our underlying ROE was still higher. Of greater significance, we demonstrated improved performance and momentum in many areas across the firm that are important to driving our ROEs sustainably higher including the following.","One, in investment banking, we had a very strong quarter driven by the strength in our underwriting and advisory franchises. Two, we continue to drive industry leading results in institutional equities despite lower market volumes around the world and this is due to the depth and breadth of our franchise and the partnership we have built with our clients over many years.","Thirdly, we drive our wealth management \u2013 we drove our wealth management margin higher even in a relatively subdued transaction environment. We also reached importantly $2 trillion in client assets a tremendous achievement a more than 3x the assets we held in 2006 on behalf of our clients.","Fourthly, our relative performance in fixed income was solid and we made progress towards one of our last strategic business change objectives with the closing on the sale of TransMontaigne on July 1st.","Fifthly, we also successfully raised our first major post Dodd-Frank merchant banking fund in Asia. This was coming in ahead of our expectations with significant institutional representation and with the decidedly less firm capital versus earlier funds. And finally, as Ruth will discuss in more detail, we increased our pro forma SLR estimate under the U.S. proposed rule to 4.6% up from 4.2% last quarter.","I will now turn the call over to Ruth to discuss the quarter in more detail and look forward to your questions at the end. Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effective DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures. The impact of DVA in the quarter was positive $87 million with $50 million in fixed income sales and trading and $37 million in equity sales and trading.","Excluding the impact of DVA firm-wide revenues were $8.5 billion down 3% versus the first quarter. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the second quarter was 1.6% reflecting a discrete tax benefit of $609 million or $0.31 per diluted share principally related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest.","Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders excluding DVA were $1.8 billion. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share excluding DVA are $0.91 after preferred dividends. On a GAAP basis including the impact of DVA firm-wide revenues for the quarter were $8.6 billion. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $1.9 billion. Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.94 after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was $33.48 per share and tangible book value was $28.53 per share.","Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were $827 billion at June 30 down modestly from $831 billion at the end of the first quarter. Deposits as of quarter end were $118 billion up $1 billion versus Q1.","Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $192 billion compared with $203 billion at the end of the first quarter. The decline was primarily driven by the deployment of excess cash from deposit into loans which reduces our bank liquidity and is consistent with the bank strategy we laid out previously.","Turning to capital, this quarter the required Basel reporting regime moved to a Basel III advanced denominator whereas last quarter the required denominator was based on Basel I plus 2.5. In both quarters, the numerators calculated based on the transitional Basel III rule. Although our calculations are not final, we believe that our common equity Tier-1 transitional ratio will be approximately 13.8% and our Tier-1 capital ratio under this regime will be approximately 15.2%.","Basel III transitional risk-weighted assets are expected to be approximately $423 billion at June 30, reflecting our best estimate of the final set of reserve rules, our pro forma common equity Tier-1 ratio using Basel III fully-phased in advanced approach was 12.1% at June 30 up from 11.6% in 1Q.","Our pro form standardized ratio was 10.8% up from 10.2% in 1Q. Pro forma fully-phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $431 billion. We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio under the U.S. regulatory proposal to be approximately 4.6% at June 30 up from 4.2% at the end of the first quarter. These estimates are preliminary and are subject to revision. We continue to expect to exceed the required 5% level in 2015 including an assumption for increasing returns of capital to shareholders.","Turning to expenses. Our total expenses this quarter were $6.6 billion flat versus the first quarter. Compensation expense was down 2% versus the prior quarter. Non-compensation expense was $2.4 billion up 5% reflecting seasonal trends.","Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In institutional securities revenues excluding DVA were $4.2 billion down 8% sequentially. Non-interest expense was $3.2 billion down 1% versus the first quarter. Compensation was $1.7 billion for the second quarter down versus the first quarter on lower revenue reflecting a 41% ratio excluding DVA.","Non-compensation expense for the second quarter was $1.5 billion up versus the first quarter also reflecting seasonality. The business reported a pretax profit of $927 million excluding the impact of DVA including the impact of DVA revenues were $4.2 billion and pretax profit was $1 billion.","In investment banking revenues of $1.4 billion were up 26% versus last quarter reflecting broad-based strength across products and regions with substantial growth in EMEA. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked number 2 in global announced in completed M&A and number 3 in global IPOs at the end of the second quarter.","Notable transactions included in advisory, Morgan Stanley is acting as defense advisor to Shire in its discussions with AbbVie regarding a potential $55 billion combination. Morgan Stanley also acted as lead financial advisor and lead left arranger on the bridge financing for Tyson Foods in its $8.6 billion acquisition of Hillshire brand.","In equity underwriting, we again evidenced the strength of our global franchise notable deals include acting as joined global coordinator and joint book runner; we priced a $3.5 billion capital increase for the National Bank of Greece. And Morgan Stanley successfully executed a $1.3 billion unregistered block trade of YPSSA amongst other international offerings.","In debt underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as global coordinator on the successful $40 billion consent solicitation of debt securities for Pemex Finance. In addition, acting as joint book runner, the firm sourced $9.9 billion of debtor in possession financing for Energy Future Holdings.","Morgan Stanley and its partner Bank of Tokyo, Mitsubishi UFJ played a leading role in structuring underwriting and syndicating the debt facilities. Advisory revenues of $418 million increased 24% versus our first quarter results due primarily to increased activity with particular strength in EMEA and Asia Pacific.","Underwriting revenues of $1 billion increased 27% versus our first quarter results driven by equity underwriting revenues of $489 million which were up 55% versus the first quarter on higher issuance volumes in the strong market and a meaningful uptick in EMEA. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $525 million higher versus the first quarter primarily driven by higher investment grade and high yield volume.","Equity sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were $1.8 billion, an increase of 5% from last quarter. Prime brokerage revenues were up reflecting the benefit of increased client balances and the dividend season. Cash revenues remained resilient against declines in market volumes across regions. Derivatives revenues were down as lower volatility reduced client activity.","Fixed income and commodities, sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were $1 billion down sequentially driven impart by typical seasonality. Commodities revenues were down substantially from a very strong 1Q. Outside of commodities revenues in most product areas declined due to lower volatility which resulted in lower client activity.","In contrast, rates revenues were modestly higher quarter-over-quarter due to improvements in both the United States and EMEA. CVA continued to be a drag in the quarter due to the tightening of our credit spreads. Average trading VAR for the second quarter was $48 million down slightly to the first quarter.","Turning to wealth management, revenues were $3.7 billion in the second quarter up 3% sequentially. Asset management revenues of $2.1 billion were up versus last quarter reflecting the benefit of higher market levels and positive flows. Transaction revenues were essentially flat to last quarter consisting primarily of commissions of $511 million down 5% versus the prior quarter due to lower activity consistent with lower exchange volumes.","Investment banking related fees of $213 million up 18% versus last quarter reflecting higher equity and preferred stock underwriting activity. And trading revenues of $267 million down 3% versus the first quarter reflecting a decrease in fixed income trading partially offset by higher returns on deferred compensation plans.","Net interest revenue increased 7% to $578 million driven primarily by higher revenues from our bank deposit program and continued growth in our lending product.","Non-interest expense was $2.9 billion flat versus last quarter. Non-compensation expense was $762 million also flat to last quarter. The compensation ratio was 59% down versus the first quarter driven by seasonal trends. The PVT margin was 21%. Profit before tax was $767 million; total client asset surpassed $2 trillion.","Global fee-based asset inflows were $12.5 billion. Fee-based assets under management increased to a record $762 billion at quarter end representing 38% of client assets. Global representatives were 16,316 essentially flat to the first quarter. Deposits in our bank deposit program were $127 billion down versus the first quarter due primarily to outflows related to tax season. Approximately $109 billion were held in Morgan Stanley banks.","Our wealth management lending balances continue to grow reflecting the ongoing execution of our bank strategy. Our PLA balances increased $1.9 billion and mortgage balances increased $1.6 billion. Production in the second quarter was at record levels for both products.","Investment management revenues of $692 million were down 6% sequentially predominantly driven by the deconsolidation of certain legal entities associated with a real estate fund sponsored by the firm.","A number of years ago, we provided a liquidity facility for the fund and not have to consolidate revenues and capital. The liquidity facility has expired. Accordingly certain legal entities associated with the fund were deconsolidated.","The deconsolidation eliminates the related revenue as well as a portion of our non-controlling interest and is net income neutral. Additionally, the deconsolidation reduces both balance sheet and risk-weighted assets. In traditional asset management, revenues of $436 million were flat to the first quarter. In real estate investing revenues of $111 million were down 15% driven by the deconsolidation.","Merchant banking revenues were $145 million down 16% driven by lower gains in investments. Non-interest expenses were $487 million up 2% from the first quarter. The compensation ratio was 42% up versus the first quarter driven primarily by the revenue impact of the deconsolidation. Non-compensation expense was $196 million up from $192 million in the first quarter. Profit before tax was $205 million down 22% sequentially due to the deconsolidation. NCI was $7 million versus $54 million last quarter again driven by the deconsolidation.","Total assets under management increased to $396 billion driven by market appreciation and positive flows. We also successfully completed a fund raising for Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia IV in the quarter, our first major post Dodd-Frank fund raising effort.","Turning to our outlook. While June was stronger than the first two months of the quarter recognizing the trading markets remain uncertain, we are on the view that it is too early to determine conditions for the balance \u2013 rest of the year. However, we see strength and opportunities across our businesses with several encouraging trends.","First, M&A volumes remain strong with a healthy backlog and growth in larger transactions which is our sweet spot. Last quarter, we discussed three catalysts for heightened M&A activity and they remain. Healthy corporate, cross border and activist activity suggesting M&A will remain vibrant.","Second, financing markets remain receptive with a strong pipeline in equity underwriting and a positive outlook for debt underwriting benefiting from M&A activity. Third, we are seeing an increase in activity in Europe. The second quarter was the strongest in Europe since the beginning of 2012 with notable improvement in both investment banking and fixed income product. Given the strength and breadth of our corporate and institutional client relationship, we are well-positioned to benefit from these trends and are focused on delivering for our clients.","More specific to Morgan Stanley, we are also increasingly seeing the fruits of the many steps we have taken during the last five years to better position the firm with retail wins worth noting.","First, we continue to benefit from lending growth which is supported by our leading client franchises in both wealth management and institutional securities. Given the scale of each of these franchises, we have ample opportunities with our existing clients while maintaining tight credit standards. As evidenced by the growth in our funded loan book again this quarter, we continue to execute against this opportunity and they remain significant upside. We are prudently building a balanced portfolio on our way to being the 10th largest depository in the U.S.","Second, as discussed before wealth management continues to deliver higher profitability with growing revenues on a higher PVT margin. Now, with 100% ownership of the wealth management business the operating leverage translates into a growing contribution to the firm.","Finally, the outperformance of our cash bond spreads enable us to finance the firm more efficiently that over time of course will result in additional upside.","Thank you for listening, James and I will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Good morning. I was wondering if you could clarify how you treat something that you mentioned but didn\u2019t quantify in your remarks, which is the CVA on the derivatives books of the market businesses. I think everyone is pretty clear in the industry now about calling out DVA, but I\u2019m not sure that CVA gets very consistent treatment and in particular since we are also focused on how FIC and equities are trending. Just want to make sure that I understand how you treat CVA and how much of your credit spreads swings might have impacted FIC particular in regard to CVA this quarter?","Ruth Porat","So as much as we call out DVA and talk about revenues excluding DVA because that does not flow through to capital. CVA does and so it goes right to the P&L. So when we discussed our fixed income and commodities revenues, it reflects the impact of CVA into your point, firms do it differently, but it does reflect at Morgan Stanley the impact of CVA and given the meaningful spread tightening we had in particular year-over-year that\u2019s pretty notable. So for example, year-over-year our fixed income business was up in all major products except foreign exchange, however, given this spread tightening we had a big drag in CVA and if you exclude the impact to CVA, our fixed income and commodities business actually would have been up.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Got it. And was the impact much more in FIC than in equities?","Ruth Porat","Yes.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Okay. Thanks. Also just to pick up on something else that you mentioned, I think to recall that in years passed like before the last couple of years your prime brokerage business did a very strong seasonal business in European dividend arm in the second quarter in particular. Can you give us a sense of how much that might have contributed in the second quarter this year?","Ruth Porat","So we \u2013 that does continue to be a benefit in the second quarter and again, along with the strength we had in PV more broadly with growth in revenues clients and client balances we continue to benefit from the seasonality. So if you look at year-over-year performance in equities that would normalize for what is continues to be a second quarter seasonal event.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Got it. Thanks. Okay. One more question which is really more on capital, you moved equity capital looks like from the parent into the business unit couple of billion dollars on the average in the institutional about $500 million in investment management which is a fairly sizeable percentage increase for that business. Is this also because of the regime change that you talked about in terms of going to the Basel III or is there something else going on there?","Ruth Porat","You nailed it. The way we disclose the allocation of capital across the various businesses is based on the capital regime in place at that point in time. And so this quarter as a result of yet another regime change both the numerator and denominator are under Basel III transitional. Last quarter the denominator was Basel I plus 2.5. This quarter the denominator is Basel III transitional advanced. So it\u2019s a regime change, we just following the required regime quarter-after-quarter. The result is more capital move from the parent to institutional securities.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Got it. Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Good morning. So quick question first on the $1.92 billion RWA in fixed does that include TransMontaigne?","Ruth Porat","We closed TransMontaigne as of July 1. And so that would include TransMontaigne because that\u2019s the second quarter number.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Perfect. Can you help us think about how much that might help reduce that number in 2Q or in 3Q rather? Excuse me.","Ruth Porat","So that \u2013 so TransMontaigne is about $2 billion of risk-weighted assets and there is also a modest liquidity benefit.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Great. Thanks. So we noticed that deposits in the bank \u2013 deposit program fell this quarter, was that seasonal and can you help us think about that this year because it didn\u2019t seem like we noticed as much with seasonal decline in prior years. So was there anything unusual going on there?","Ruth Porat","So firm-wide, the deposits are reported in two lines. You\u2019ve got the bank and then the parent and we have had the onboarding of deposits from Citi. So the deposits overall were up $1 billion, $5 billion from contractual onboarding deposits the tier point that was offset by the typical season outflows for tax payments. Tax payments were actually greater than outflows and what we saw was increasing use of PLA or securities based lending product by clients to pay taxes. I think what\u2019s worth noting is in the fourth quarter deposits tend to be higher due to year end selling.","And then on the flip side, we see deposits going down some in the second quarter with tax payment. So net-net year-end selling and tax payments due tend to even each other out over the period but what you are seeing here is the second quarter seasonality.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Great. And then just clarifying because I got a handful of questions about it before the opening. The bank program deposits include Citi\u2019s portion right. And if we look down at the footnote, we can see Morgan Stanley\u2019s piece and that went from 108 to 109 this quarter. So the rate slowed but it is still was headed in an upward direction, correct?","Ruth Porat","In the wealth management line?","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Right.","Ruth Porat","Yes, wealth management went down right.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Perfect, okay. And then also on the comps and the wealth management business, is it possible to think about how much of that is from the amortization of forgivable loans written to recruit brokers because the past several years we have gone through sort of elevated recruiting environment. And if we think about, I think maybe James made some comments at the Morgan Stanley FIC conference about how recruiting in competition maybe moderating a bit. And so if we think about turnover staying at current levels, is it possible that you guys can help us think about to wealth management comp over time?","Ruth Porat","Well, let me give you a couple of pieces. So the comp ratio is down this quarter and that reflects typical first quarter seasonality with FICA and it\u2019s typically down it was here. The reason we are guiding down to the 55% or lower comp ratio over time really goes to the growth in net interest income and the execution of our bank strategy and the tremendous operating leverage we have as we continue to deploy deposits into lending product.","And so if you again, looking at the overall business where we will be driving it to 55% or lower because the margin on that product -- lending product is as pretty significant and the lending product does not on the same formulaic comp grid. So I think if you are trying to gauge where is the comp ratio going, the biggest driver of that will be NII and the growth in lending product.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Sure.","James Gorman","Hey, Brenan just to separate it. I think your issue was around the amortization also of the deals in addition to what Ruth just described.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Yes.","James Gorman","Long-term strategically in an oligopoly structure you would expect there would be less movement of financial advisors between firms. That doesn\u2019t translate yet into the financials. But over the long-term we think it will.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. Great. Are you were exactly right Jim, I was kind of \u2013 I completely get the NII and how that\u2019s not necessarily on the grid type of a payout and therefore should help the comp. I just was hoping to try to get at maybe some of that amortization. So I guess, the only color you guys gave is over the longer run assuming competition stays down that should also help as a tailwind overall as well to.","James Gorman","Yes. It will.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. And then last one from me \u2013 touched on it a bit prior but prime brokerage was definitely a positive, you hit on seasonality, but as you said when we look year-over-year that should normalize for the seasonality and you guys were flat which in this quarter flat is the new up. So maybe could you help us in parsing out maybe any other benefits that you might have had and was it mostly in prime brokerage and aside from seasonality were there any drivers and tailwinds there?","Ruth Porat","We talked about for many quarters this is a stellar franchise. They have had consistency of performance for many quarters. It\u2019s a diversified global franchise across products and geographies we often talk about managing it, leading it across the nine-box strategy with the product cash. Derivatives and PV on the one-hand and the regions of the world Americas, EMEA and Asia on the other dimension and looking for leadership and delivering for clients within each of those boxes and then looking at opportunities to build adjacencies across those various boxes. We had strength this quarter led by prime brokerage as I noted already with growth in revenues clients and client balances.","And then in terms of cash products we continue to have strong performance in cash. We do believe we took wallet share there. We had good client engagement in index rebalancing. Derivatives was a bit lower on the back of lower volatility but overall it\u2019s a very strong franchise that continues to deliver.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Terrific. Thanks so much. And congrats for good results in a tough quarter here.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","James Gorman","Thanks Brennan.","Operator","Your next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi. Ruth, you mentioned you are moving to leverage your status as the 10th largest depositor in the U.S. and looking at the bank data from call reports it looks like the ROA of the bank is only 60 basis points, and I\u2019m not sure if you should just look at the bank in isolation. Also if we look at the information in your package today, it looks a loan to deposit ratio of 39% or so. If you could just confirm whether this is at least one way to look at your company and to highlight where you want to go let\u2019s say loan to deposit ratio or the ROA of the bank?","Ruth Porat","So what we try to lay out in a number of presentations is the contractual growth in deposits where we are in terms of asset mix. And as you look over time how we look to deploy those deposits moving more from cash until lending products. And clearly the yield today continues to be pretty low given where we are still over weighting cash, philosophically the way we are looking at it is deposit growth is going to support lending is supporting lending in both institutional securities and wealth management both are leading franchises with a large base of untapped clients. And we have a very strong opportunity therefore to continue to build out a nice diversified asset mix here. And while maintaining strong credit standards.","So I think if you look at the decks that we put out, you will see where the yield on that should go over time. There is a lot of noise in the call reports that directionally it would give you sense of the mix between these two franchises wealth management and institutional securities.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","How much would Morgan Stanley benefit if interest rates increase by 100 basis points, maybe just on the bank side or for the firm as a whole, I don\u2019t think you guys have articulated in that way?","Ruth Porat","Quite meaningfully, I mean what we have articulated is, the comp structure in the bank and so again, we are a best portfolio continues to be very short duration and as we are looking at continuing to deploy deposits into lending products the rising rate environments quite meaningfully the margin in the bank given we have no bricks and mortar, we have no customer acquisition cost because we are really lending to our existing client base which is not only a cost benefit but a credit risk management benefit. We have already built the infrastructure to support the loan growth and I have already commented on the compensation approach it\u2019s not on the formulaic grids. So the bank has a very high margin rising rates to be significant.","What we did in the deck that I have already alluded to as we indicated where we were at a point in time and just following the forward yield curve what kind of lift you would see in the yield if you are just following the forward yield curve. And what we tried to do is give you all of the various levers so between the bond boarding and deposits the current mix of assets, the deployment plan over time, you can talk about how you want.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And then lastly, James, you gave a comment, it was almost an aside, in talking about your ROE targets saying well perhaps 15% ROE is possible some day and it was the first time I heard you say that 15% would even be possible for an ROE and that\u2019s a long way from where you have been and it\u2019s a nice stretch from where you are now? But did you say that and why did you mention that you feel more positive about the outlook or is it just a hypothetical one day sort of statement.","James Gorman","I think the time that I said that was in the context of what was available for the industry. And this has been an industry Mike as you know where ROEs have 20 plus percent were the norm. You double the capital, you shrink the balance sheet and unless you create new businesses you are 20 plus percent ROE immediately dropped to sub 5% which is exactly what happened with the industry.","The industry is now working its way back to 10% ROEs through buybacks more efficient capital usage for the balance sheet management. And in our case building diverse businesses that use less capital and obviously contribute to our ROE. So I think \u2013 I certainly not making an immediate projection this is sort of a stage field where the industry is going, is it probable the industry returns to 20% plus ROEs, no, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s probable. Is it probable the industry stays below 10%, no, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s probable.","So it\u2019s sort of framing it now. You will draw your own conclusions about Morgan Stanley\u2019s business mix versus obviously lots of other financial institutions and I think your point about the bank you just asked Ruth about is exactly at sort of strategic core part of the next evolution of this firm is to develop $130 billion deposit bank within Morgan Stanley which is a very exciting prospect, it\u2019s not going to happen immediately. And it\u2019s going to be done with prudence as respect to lending. But it will be done. And it will be done over several years.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Just if you have a superior business mix that should eventually mean a superior ROE otherwise it might not be a superior business mix. So at some point with higher rates, is it possible Morgan Stanley could get an ROE of 15% or so?","James Gorman","You know, there is a great old phrase of a journey with thousands miles begins with a single step. And we are working our way towards 10% when we get there we will have another conversation with you.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Good morning, James. Good morning, Ruth.","James Gorman","Good morning.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Firstly, a first quick question on the investment management business Ruth. In the investment management business, the core asset management fee line was up 10% linked quarter, which is a little bit surprising just given AUM growth was closer to 4. Any color you have on what\u2019s driving that would be appreciated.","Ruth Porat","We have continued to execute on the business. We had good flows in the business. Have been investing in, in distribution. You can see flows were up across the broad in traditional asset management. And I think that the team continues to execute well.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Okay. Got it. James on the wealth management business I mean first of all congratulations on getting to the $2 trillion club. While asset growth has been strong both financial advisor head count and branch growth have been more muted. I appreciate your focus in that business has been on an increasing productivity and efficiency. That said, I would be curious if you guys actually have plans to grow your core advisor base and locations going forward?","Ruth Porat","So as we have talked about for quite some time we are focused on productivity and quality of FAs rather than just sheer number in it and in fact have over time reduced the lower productivity financial advisors we feel very good in and around this level. We are not managing to a specific number and as it relates to the number of locations that we have. We have had an opportunity in particular post closing the acquisition of the joint venture to look at places where we could consolidate offices within major cities.","And again, that\u2019s done on a case by case basis as we look at leases rolling off, the question is within any particular area is there logic in combining an office where you have a fully staffed office with a great culture working really well. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you want to try and merger two offices together that may not be the most effective for clients or the best experience for financial advisor. So we reduced the number of locations quite a bit over the last couple of years, I think the big bulk of the opportunity we really achieved there and now you will see ones and twos depending on any particular market. But no plans, we feel good about where we are.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks. And then lastly from me, just on the prime business you spoke a lot today. Just curious if you \u2013 what you are hearing from the clients in terms of pricing trends just given the implications for supplementary leverage ratio across the industry?","Ruth Porat","We are starting to hear some peers are repricing balance sheet as it affects this business and fixed income product as well very much to your point as a result of the SLR.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","James Gorman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks very much. Ruth just circling back to the SLR for a moment. I\u2019m looking at the slide that you and James put out for the update in January, which highlighted the potential sources of increase. I\u2019m wondering if you can help me understand kind of what the approximate contribution of these categories were to the 40 basis point improvement sequentially?","Ruth Porat","The biggest driver then taking it from 4.2% last quarter to 4.6% this quarter was the numerator that was most of the improvement and that was due to the combined benefit from earnings of the preferred issuance we did early in the quarter, the multiplier effect with DTA and investment capacity deductions. We talked about previously. We continue to focus on mitigating some of the other numerator deduction. And then the remaining improvement is from the denominator items that we talked about previously. Some ongoing compression, RWAs were obviously down in fixed income where you see the PFE grows up. Some mitigation just early days of mitigating the net long CDS sold in some modest balance sheet reduction. But the overwhelming the majority of it was in the numerator and we are executing the opportunities now in the denominator.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And is there any change to the guidance given at that point of those various benefits generating 188 around 200 basis points of potential improvement?","Ruth Porat","Well, the rules change now the inclusion of net long CDS sold and we have obviously had a big move in the ratio from 4.2% to 4.6%. We feel very comfortable with greater than 5% in 2015 with higher returns of capital which may not surprise you even we are sitting here at 4.6% today. And as I said, across the various work stream we are continuing to execute to reduce PFE where it makes sense while still supporting our client activity and client franchise. There are certain areas -- that\u2019s the example of which is compression which I characterized in the past is a good hygiene. It\u2019s effective to reduce the overall PFE through compression activities and we are executing there. The pace is strong. We have accomplished a lot year-to-date the protocol around it has improved. And so we expect the pace will continue to be good. So we are continuing to execute against each of these, the mix may change a bit as we have added now net long CDS sold mitigation as an added opportunity given the role change.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Great. And if I can just transition quickly on page 7 of the supplements in the other funded loans category, which I recognize is small relative to the balance sheet but up very significantly. And I think the footnote suggest that much of this could be purchase loans. And I\u2019m just wondering what would be the strategy behind growing a purchased loan portfolio?","Ruth Porat","No. I\u2019m glad you asked because the growth within the lending book again across wealth management and institutional securities is really executing with our clients and areas where we have a strong franchise, strong client base domain expertise. And so within institutional securities it is an area consistent with what we have discussed today. I talked about it as small fleet across a number of different areas including commercial real estate warehouse project finance. That\u2019s really the bulk of what that\u2019s what drove the increase in funded loan balances up about $5 billion which is as you said is a good increase but small relative to the scale of our franchise. I mean it\u2019s an example of commercial real estate with a 20-year track record that leadership with a really high quality franchise there and we have history originating loans outside the bank. We are now doing more in the bank but we are targeting very much our client base in areas where we have domain expertise.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Great. Thanks and just finally, speculating that the fact you called out on legal costs suggests that they were de minimis in the period?","Ruth Porat","I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t hear the question.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","That there was no call out on legal cost suggest that they were low in the quarter?","Ruth Porat","Right. There was really not much to note.","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Hi. Thanks. Ruth, you mentioned lower funding cost earlier and it\u2019s clear they have gone down a lot. How should we think about how long it takes to work its way through, is it really just inverse of maybe the average maturity. So in other words you get a 15% to 20% of that benefit each year as your debt rose?","Ruth Porat","That\u2019s a fair way to think about it.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay. And so that could \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t call it material but it can move the needle in the firms overall earnings on a year-by-year basis?","Ruth Porat","Yes. Our view is, you have seen real compression across the industry but we outperformed peers. And I think that our view is that it reflects all that we have done over the last number of years to reposition both the business mix and the balance sheet. And so we view it as another tailwind that will leg into tier point over time. But, it\u2019s a benefit and it will be a benefit even in a rising rate environment on a relative basis given our spreads have come in more than peers.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay. Yes. That\u2019s fair enough. I don\u2019t know if you have already addressed it pieces across the other questions but are there \u2013 you mentioned bits and pieces of repricing or attempts to repricing prime brokerage. Maybe a broader question of how you think SLR is mostly impacting the big banks and brokers are impacting the markets and how it will impact how you do your balance sheet planning?","Ruth Porat","Well, we do think it continues to be the way of constraint for banks on both sides of the Atlantic and you are seeing the reduction of balance sheet in lower return assets. And as I noticed some peers are repricing balance sheet using a harsher lens on allocation of balance sheet. So we are seeing wider bit offer in certain financing markets. There was some dislocation in treasury sales which we see as transitory. And the fed prevented additional dislocation with the by-side using the RRP program prevented a more painful readjustment period but you are seeing the impact kind of ripple through in a number of different ways.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","But sounds like a lot of that stuff has made its way through in other words it\u2019s rippled through but its not creating sea change, I\u2019m putting words in your mouth, I realize?","Ruth Porat","I think you are still seeing an evolution here. I would agree for example on treasury sales we view that as transitory. But as firms reposition where they are using balance sheet and putting balance sheet behind client activities I think it continues to evolve in particular given some of the requirements for the European banks. We feel good about where we are because we have evolved our business mix not to keep coming back to that but it\u2019s really important way we think about our business given the changes that we made over the last several years with the strength of wealth management. The lens that we have on balance sheet within fixed income going back sometimes now. We feel we taken the steps, we need to take and have clarity about the execution path within fixed income equities continue to be performing as it consistently as and we have opportunities to support our banking clients with the growth in lending products. So we feel good about where we are but I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s necessarily done across the industry.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay. And then just a little clean up, you have a market gain in the quarter and where was it?","Ruth Porat","That was in the investment lines. It wasn\u2019t a meaningful impact.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay, cool. Thanks Ruth.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","The question will come from Steve Chubak with Nomura.","Steve Chubak - Nomura","Hi. Good morning.","Ruth Porat","Good morning.","James Gorman","Good morning.","Steve Chubak - Nomura","So I had a follow-up question on operating leverage at the bank and well, I was hoping to clarify when we go through the modeling process for wealth management earnings and higher rate scenario. The implied comp ratio that we derive is actually closer to the \u2013 outside of very low 50s. So about 300 to 500 basis points that are -- than your stated target of 55%. And I was wondering whether your mid-50 target contemplates the benefit from higher rates. And maybe even in that same vein where do you see operating margins peaking in a more normalized rate back drop?","Ruth Porat","So the 55% comp ratio and the PVT margin guidance of 22% to 25% assumes the flat rate environment. And we specifically did that so that you could model in your outlook for a rising rate environment. But very much to your point there is tremendous operating leverage in a rising rate environment for the wealth management business. And throughout that the growth in that lending book and through what we were doing in the FS portfolio. So there is upside and you will see that flow through as rates rise and will let you forecast when that happens.","Steve Chubak - Nomura","Okay, great. And just switching gears for a moment or two. I have a capital question pertaining to FIC and just an in effort to help us better monitor your ongoing FIC ROE progress under all the different binding constraints had exist today. It would be really helpful if you could help clarify the current level of required capital as measured under the SLR to support the FIC business specifically. And also given how proactive you have been on the mitigation front, how you should think about required capital levels trending over the next couple of years.","Ruth Porat","So we have broken out a lot of detail here in particular risk weighted assets within institutional securities breaking it down to the fixed income level. So if you get a sense of what \u2013 the progress we are making in that business you can see revenues here today and I think that\u2019s where we are going to leave it, we have been indicating ROEs high and I think it\u2019s intuitive given lower required capital separately we are breaking out lot of the components of the various capital ratios and the leverage ratio and are on good path forward to this greater than 5%.","Steve Chubak - Nomura","Okay. And there has been any change to I guess is roughly $5 billion plus or minus of FIC revenues that were required to achieve your targeted 10% ROE within FIC, presumably it would be a little bit lower just given that you have been more proactive once again on the mitigation front?","Ruth Porat","That\u2019s the indicator we are very much focused on increasing ROE and their multiple levers to get their between revenues expenses and capital. But, as an example couple of quarters ago when I was talking about our commodities business, the physical oil commodities businesses that we were selling, they have revenues that are PBT break-even with some capital tied up in them. So exiting physical oil may reduce revenues but it\u2019s accretive to capital. And accretive to earnings and again, that\u2019s why as we are looking at we said we want to be very clear we are not looking at revenues \u2013 revenue sake we are looking at what\u2019s the most vibrant fixed income business unto itself and when we talk about our fixed income business we are looking at a return on capital greater than 10% within fixed income and moving in that direction. And then beyond that it\u2019s accretive to the returns of the firm. And I talk about this often on these calls but it is key within investment banking yet again this quarter we had over $500 million of fixed income underwriting revenues which is accretive to those client relationship with our clients are looking forward from us but really does benefit from the execution capabilities within fixed income.","And similarly within our wealth management business our clients want fixed income product, municipal product, more specifically, and that benefits from the strength of what we have within fixed income. But we are holding fixed income to a standard like all of our businesses of generating an appropriate return on capital and systematically doing using each one of those levers to drive to a higher return and then everything else that\u2019s accretive to the other businesses benefits the bottom line.","Steve Chubak - Nomura","Okay, great. That detail was extremely helpful. Ruth, thank you for taking my questions.","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America","Thanks. Just one quick last one. When we think about the outlook on the Institutional Securities business, and this is either James or Ruth. Can you give us some sense, I guess two parts, just on the Investment Banking side given the pipeline of M&A, when \u2013 from a timing standpoint, when a lot of those things will close once announced? And any other revenues that can shoot off from there.","And then on the trading side of the business, we're used to normal seasonality based on the last 20 years. Given that the business has changed and firms have restructured some parts of it, has anything changed on that front, whether it's because of client mix or because of its product mix that we see less seasonality than we have in the past?","Ruth Porat","So starting with the first part on M&A and closing and implications for revenues if you look through the year, it does. And obviously varies depending upon the nature of the deal, the industry, the regulatory approvals required so it can be from a month to many months, think 3 to 9 months indicate that they can cut across a number of different periods.","And typically much as a financing is done towards the latter end of that as you are closing although there can be some hedging activity up front. I think the main point that is encouraging as the pipeline continues to be very healthy across all products and in M&A, I noted the momentum with these key drivers across board or corporate activity and activist activity and now we are seeing larger deals. But probably one of the most additional encouraging elements for the team is that the velocity of deals has really picked up as well in other words if you go back a year or two we talked a lot about a healthy pipeline that just wasn\u2019t crossing the finish line and getting into execution and being announced whereas now what you are seeing is much greater clarity and velocity going from identification of a strategic opportunity to announcement and execution that velocity we think is encouraging and the underwriting calendar does remain strong globally, it remain strong in particular the equity side outside of the U.S.","So that should be \u2013 that should give us again all things equal some momentum going through the balance of the year. And then on the trading side it\u2019s tough to call as I said we saw a pick up in June but too early to call whether that have legs to it given most of this year we saw lower trading volumes, lower volatility. And so bit of a pick up in June is not something I would say is fair to extrapolate from here. And as you pointed out summer seasonality is in front of us. Whether the trends change over time and trading businesses as a result of regulatory requirements tough to say I think the one that\u2019s clear is summer seasonality.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Celeste Brown","Thanks so much for joining us for our second quarter call. And we are look forward to speaking to you again in three months.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call.

Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James Gorman","Good morning everyone. In a moment, I\u2019m going to take you through our outlook and plan for 2017, but before doing so, let me briefly touch on the fourth quarter.","It\u2019s fair to say the year finished a lot better than it began. After a difficult first quarter, Morgan Stanley delivered three consecutive quarters with revenues at approximately $9 billion, each with an ROE north of 8%. While our fourth quarter contained some positive and negative adjustments, which Jon will touch on shortly, our operating performance was consistent with what you\u2019ve seen from us since the beginning of the second quarter.","There is certainly more reason to be optimistic as we enter 2017 than there was at the beginning of 2016. The surge in consumer confidence after the U.S. election, the recent and anticipated Fed rate hikes, the strengthening U.S. economy and potential corporate tax reform are positives for our business. Notwithstanding these potential positives, we intend to remain extremely disciplined. This is especially true with regard to expense management.","Before transitioning to our annual deck, let me say a few words about Morgan Stanley\u2019s management team. Many members of the firm\u2019s operating and management committees have spent much of their careers at Morgan Stanley, with many having dedicated more than 20 years to this firm. The stability of the team combined with the depth of experience and operating discipline honed in the difficult years during and after the financial crisis is an undeniable asset in the years ahead. In the next minutes, you will hear us delve into numbers and goals, but it is the culture and people of this firm that will get us to where we want to be.","Now with that, please turn to the slides that you can find on the investors relations website, after which Jon will take you through the quarter in detail. Following our prepared remarks, we will both take your questions.","Slide 3 outlines the key strategic objectives for 2017 that we reviewed on this call last year. In each instance, we feel we\u2019re on track. We are on course to deliver $1 billion of expense reductions to our cost base in 2017. On relatively flat annual revenues in \u201916, we reduced non-compensation expenses significantly and continued to exercise discipline on compensation.","At the end of 2015, we undertook a meaningful restructuring of our fixed income business in an effort to better align its capital and resources with the market opportunity. Our goal is to maintain our historical revenue footprint of $1 billion-plus per quarter but with significantly fewer resources. In 2016, we exceeded this average quarterly target with full-year revenues at $5.1 billion and delivered three consecutive quarters above that $1 billion mark.","In wealth management, the full year\u2019s pre-tax margin was 22%, and we expect to hit the 23 to 25% range by year-end \u201917. We also achieved record pre-tax earnings of $3.4 billion in the face of a number of macro headwinds, including sustained low interest rates and muted retail investor engagement.","In 2016, we received a conditional non-objection to our CCAR capital plan, which included increasing our buybacks by 40% to $3.5 billion and our quarterly dividend from $0.15 per share to $0.20 per share. We re-submitted our revised capital plan in December and look forward to hearing back from the Federal Reserve on our results.","Finally, 2016\u2019s ROE demonstrated progress towards our 9% to 11% goal for 2017.","Turning to Slide 4, you can see that our ROE obviously was 8%. Assuming normal market conditions prevail, as they did over the last three quarters when our ROE averaged 8.5%, we remain on target for our 9% to 11% goal for 2017.","As outlined on Slide 5, there are a number of opportunities for us to continue improving our operating performance. I\u2019m going to address each of these five opportunities in turn.","On Slide 6, turning to that now, you can see that although our total revenues were relatively flat in 2016, we grew our pre-tax profit excluding DVA by nearly $1 billion. As a management team, we have focused on controlling what we can. Optimizing our expense base has been a key tenet of this approach and is a measure of our operating leverage.","Project Streamline\u2019s 200 expense initiatives have yielded meaningful results to date. Notable successes include leveraging our centers of excellence, reducing headcount in call locations, and closing redundant data centers. Additionally, the broad-based nature of the initiatives has energized a more expense-focused culture across the whole firm. This should help us realize the remaining savings potential in 2017 and maintain operating leverage in a rising revenue environment.","On the compensation side, our ISC expense compensation ratio met our target to be at or below 37%. Savings were driven by the fixed income restructuring and our continued discipline. In wealth management, we demonstrated progress towards our goal of achieving a compensation ratio of 56% or lower. We intend to maintain that discipline consistent with the goals mentioned while recognizing the competitive dynamics in this business. The combination of these efforts resulted in a meaningful improvement in our expense efficiency ratio from 77.2% in 2015, excluding DBA, to below 75% in 2016.","As illustrated on Slide 7, in advisory we\u2019ve grown our share and completed M&A and retained our ranking in a market that exhibited resilience in 2016. The year was more challenging for the equity underwriting market as volatility and the idiosyncratic risk events kept many would-be issuers on the sidelines. On a diminished industry fee base, we maintained our market share. Looking to 2017, we are optimistic and see upside from a normalization of volumes.","Slide 8 outlines key strategic priorities within our sales and trading business. In the fall of 2015, we unified our sales and trading franchise under one leadership team, and 2016 was a year of integration. We\u2019re now managing the divisions holistically, aiming to optimize resources, talent, capital and technology. Our equities division has consistently been number one among global peers. We continue to refine our strategy with the goal of maintaining that leadership across regions, including as a top franchise among global firms in Europe and profitably growing wallet share. This includes deepening our relationships in prime brokerage as well as focusing on providing content, capital, and execution services to clients in flow trading.","In addition, we remain committed to investing our Asia franchise as we expect a positive long-term secular trend of increasing activity and improving liquidity in the region. While the equity sales and trading landscape remains competitive, the shifting dynamics may benefit the leading players.","The restructure in fixed income made a year ago was consistent with our objective to have a credible and critically sized business that was relevant to our clients and supported adjacencies that exist with our ISG and wealth management franchises. Turning to Slide 9, as you can see on one measure of success, we set an internal target which was externally communicated to generate average revenue on a quarterly basis of at least $1 billion with reduced resources. As properly discussed, we met this goal and we want to ensure it plays out through 2017 and beyond. The results are encouraging. Importantly, in a more favorable environment characterized by rising rates, more active macro markets, and a vibrant corporate activity, we expect to participate in a growing wallet but with a lower cost base.","So to finish our discussion on sales and trading, I would like to point to the very strong performance in equities. For the third consecutive year, we increased wallet share to 20%, maintaining revenues in excess of $8 billion in a shrinking market.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 10. In 2008, we embarked on a multi-year transformation of the wealth management business. The Smith Barney acquisition gave us an undeniable scale benefit, particularly when combined with ongoing cost management. At the same time, we built our bank infrastructure and have seen material growth in annuitized revenues. As you can see, this led to a 22% compound growth rate in our pre-tax earnings since 2010 against a 4% growth in revenues.","However, as shown on Slide 11, what has been missing from this picture is retail investor engagement and any material benefit from rising rates. The Fed\u2019s actions in December and expected rate increased in 2017 and 2018 combined with a more positive investor sentiment lead us to believe there is real upside to the business over the next several years. Realizing that upside will require us to maintain expense discipline as we grow revenues.","In addition, two years from now the 10-year retention notes that were put in place with our Smith Barney acquisition will expire. Further, our U.S. bank subsidiaries continue to provide us with organic revenue opportunities, not only because of the expected rate rise but also because of the continuation of our deposit deployment strategy. We intend to discuss this in more detail in the year ahead.","Before moving ahead, let me spend a few moments on Slide 12 to discuss the digital landscape. Much has been said about the digital shift in financial services, and there is no question that technology is changing some areas in the wealth management arena. It is an important strategic component for us to realize the business\u2019 growth potential. Our strategies\u2019 primary goals are threefold: first, we want to modernize our branch system using digital to allow our financial advisors and branch operations to be more efficient serving current clients. Second, we want to provide our financial advisors with the necessary tools and analytics to deliver high-quality advice and engage with clients through a variety of channels. Finally and over time, we want digital capabilities to service individuals who are more focused on a full digital relationship. As part of achieving these goals, in 2016 alone we negotiated over 10 alliances with industry-leading digital providers. You\u2019ll hear a lot more about this throughout the year.","Slide 13 then summarizes the growth opportunities in wealth management. Together with an improving U.S. economy, moderating revenue headwinds, execution of both our revenue and expense initiatives as well as structural savings from the Smith Barney transaction, all of these serve as a powerful combination to achieve our margin targets in 2017 and beyond.","I\u2019d now like to spend a few moments addressing investment management. Slide 14 outlines the business. As a reminder, the business has approximately $400 billion in assets under management with world-class expertise in a number of segments, including our real assets, portfolio solutions, liquidity, and global equity businesses. In the fall of 2015, we asked Dan Simkowitz to run the business reporting directly to me. Throughout 2016, we undertook an organizational realignment aimed to unify the business, rationalize costs, and better take advantage of the firm\u2019s distribution and origination platforms. We\u2019ve also positioned ourselves for growth by launching new products such as our ultra-short bond fund, and have had strong momentum in fundraising across a number of funds, including private infrastructure and real estate. Finally in 2016, we dealt with what I would describe as legacy clean-ups to the business.","In the fourth quarter, we sold or marked down a number of third party LP fund positions from the 2005 to 2007 period. Jon will walk through the associated costs in a moment. I am confident that the business will move forward on more stable footing. In the medium to long term, we continue to see opportunities for growth, which you\u2019ll hear more about throughout the year.","Let\u2019s now turn to the final slide of the presentation. Over the past few years, we\u2019ve consistently increased our dividend and significantly increased our total payout to approximately $5 billion while also growing our common equity base. We believe we are more than sufficiently capitalized for our business mix as well as for our size and risk profile. Strong capital return is a critical element of our future success.","Thank you for listening. Now let me turn it back to Jon, who will discuss our fourth quarter results, and then together we will take your questions.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you James, and good morning. The fourth quarter was solid, demonstrating continued consistency and progress against the 2017 plan we outlined last year. In a quarter that is typically characterized by a slowdown across several of our businesses during the holiday season, we generate the highest quarterly revenues for the year. Firm revenues of $9 billion were up modestly compared to Q3, making the third consecutive quarter with revenues of approximately $9 billion. In the fourth quarter, CBC was $2.2 billion, EPS was $0.81, and ROE was 8.7.","Our results in the quarter benefits from net discrete tax benefits of $135 million. These tax benefits were largely offset by other discrete items in wealth management and investment management, which I will discuss shortly.","For the fourth quarter, non-interest expenses were $6.8 billion. Typically fourth quarter seasonality and professional services contributed to the sequential elevation. For the full year, non-compensation expenses are down approximately $700 million. Total non-interest expenses were down a little less than $900 million for the year. While some of the expense reduction was attributable to our business mix, Project Streamline initiatives accounted for the vast majority of these savings.","As you know, with Project Streamline last year, we\u2019ve committed to reducing $1 billion of expenses by 2017, assuming flat revenues. The targeted reduction was driven by three core levers: support services efficiencies, compensation discipline, and normalized litigation.","As it relates to support services, we continue to make progress in our workforce strategy, taking advantage of technology as appropriate. We have thoroughly reviewed our vendor relationships, identifying and executing consolidation opportunities that resulted in synergies and rate reductions. We have noticeably reduced marketing and business development costs by actively managing discretionary spending combined with price renegotiations. We continue to benefit from shutting down the two North American data centers and remain on track to close two additional ones last year. Finally, where we have right-sized certain businesses, we have also right-sized related support groups. Further, we have discontinued services and associated non-compensation costs tied to these reductions.","In addition to support service efficiencies, we remain disciplined around compensation, and litigation expenses have also decreased year over year. As we look forward to 2017, we are well on our way to executing the roughly 200 expense initiatives we identified. Importantly, we are focused on keeping these costs permanently out of the expense base.","Now to the businesses. Our institutional securities franchise performed well in Q4. All three of our major business lines produced strong results with total net revenues of $4.6 billion, essentially flat to the third quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $1.7 billion for the quarter, up 11% sequentially mainly driven by seasonality and execution-related costs. Compensation expenses were $1.6 billion, bringing our full-year ISG compensation to net revenue ratio to 36% compared to approximately 37% last year, excluding DBA.","In investment banking, we generated $1.3 billion in revenue, a 15% increase over the third quarter. The increase was driven by continued strength in advisory and a rebound in fixed income underwriting revenues, partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues. For 2016, we are number two globally in IPOs, announced M&A, completed M&A, as well as equity and equity-linked offerings. Going into 2017, the overall investment banking pipelines remain healthy. Capital markets are open and functioning with increased investor optimism post-election. It is too early to tell whether the optimism will translate into conviction, allowing us to pull deals from our pipeline into the markets.","Advisory revenues for the quarter were $628 million, up 25% versus 3Q16, and at $2.2 billion they were up 13% for the full year. In an environment where growth continues to be challenged, clients are engaged in strategic dialogue and executing on meaningful transactions.","Turning to underwriting, the difficult environment for equity underwriting observed throughout the year continued into the fourth quarter. Revenues were $225 million, down 5% versus 3Q16. Several political events, such as the U.S. election and the Italian referendum, along with actions by the FMOC, ECB, and OPEC contributed to conservatism by issuers and investors throughout the quarter. Specifically in IPOs, while activity generally picked up after the first quarter, volumes in 2016 were down 35%.","Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 16% sequentially to $421 million, driven by strength in high yield and a pick-up in event lending. As previously discussed, we tend to perform better in markets where we see more non-commoditized debt products and activity. Looking ahead, both investment grade and high-yield markets continue to be open to issuers, and we expect to see healthy activity in 2017.","Sales and trading revenues were flat sequentially, weathering seasonal trends, demonstrating strong and consistent performance throughout the quarter. In equities, we expect to finish number one globally for the third consecutive year with annual revenues again exceeding $8 billion. In the fourth quarter, revenues were just under $2 billion, up 4% versus the fourth quarter. Performance was strong across all products and regions.","Revenues in the Americas has particularly strong growth as investor optimism and trading activity improved after the election. As a consequence, cash equities were higher sequentially as market volumes increased. Compared to most fourth quarter, derivatives withstood recent seasonal trends and demonstrated strength throughout the year.","In fixed income sales and trading, we continued to build on momentum from the prior two quarters. Q4 revenues of just under $1.5 billion were seasonally strong and essentially unchanged from the third quarter. Idiosyncratic events resulted in an active trading environment. Quarter over quarter, our macro businesses benefited from increased volumes in rates and repositioning in FX as the markets re-priced the path for U.S. monetary and fiscal policy following the election. Credit saw a sequential decrease as activity was slower than the third quarter, although the general environment remained relatively benign.","Fixed income RWAs and SLR exposure ex-lending were $117 billion and $339 billion respectively on December 31. As James discussed, we are managing our sales and trading business holistically and are sharing and optimizing resources as appropriate. Accordingly, going forward we will no longer report individual RWA and SLR targets for fixed income.","Full revenues for fixed income of $5.1 billion, up 19% versus 2015, are the highest since 2012 ex-DBA. The comparison is more favorable when taking into account the sale of our oil merchanting business in 4Q15.","Lastly, average trading VAR for the quarter was $39 million, down versus $42 million last quarter. We continue to take advantage of periods of market liquidity to de-risk our balance sheet. This provides us with an opportunity to prudently raise VAR if accretive client opportunities present themselves.","Now turning to wealth management, we reported record net revenues of $4 billion, and annualized revenue per FA is over $1 million for the first time. The PBT margin was 22%, negatively impacted by a provision in connection with certain brokerage tax reporting issues. We saw strong client flows of $17 billion. Fee-based assets increased 3% to $877 billion and now represent 42% of client assets. Both are at respective highs. Total client assets now stand at $2.1 trillion and this positions us well going into 2017.","Asset management revenues increased 2% quarter-over-quarter, further building our base of annuitized revenues. Net interest income was up 11% sequentially. The increase was attributable to both loan growth and lower prepayment amortization. Bank lending balances were up approximately $3 billion quarter over quarter, ending the year at $60 billion. Over the last year, net interest income growth of 19% was primarily driven by our deposit deployment strategy and lending growth. Looking ahead, we would expect further NII growth but expect a more balanced contribution from deposit deployment and interest rates.","Transactional activity benefited from the strength in the back half of the quarter as retail investors re-entered the market, driving stronger commission revenues. This was partially offset by a continued subdued equity underwriting calendar. Total transaction revenues were $774 million, down 2% versus 3Q but up when excluding the impact of mark-to-market losses on our deferred compensation plans.","Non-compensation expenses were up 13% in the quarter. The aforementioned provision and seasonality contributed to the increase. The compensation ratio was 56.5 on a full-year basis, on track to meet our 2017 objective of at or below 56%. The execution of our expense initiatives has allowed us to continue to invest in our infrastructure, our digital capabilities and readiness for future regulatory developments, while simultaneously improving our margins.","In investment management, total net revenues were $500 million, down 9% quarter over quarter. The business reported asset management fees of $512 million and AUM of $417 billion, both essentially unchanged versus 3Q. Investment revenues in the quarter were negative $24 million, which included a loss of approximately $60 million associated with the sales and markdowns of non-strategic third party LP investments. Overall, expenses were up 4% quarter over quarter.","Following updated guidance from the Federal Reserve at the end of 2016, we will apply for additional extensions for essentially all of our investments in legacy cover funds, subject to the Volcker rule.","Turning to the balance sheet, total and average assets remain relatively flat at $811 billion and $821 billion respectively. Pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $371 billion, essentially flat to the third quarter. Our capital position remains strong. Our pro forma fully phased in Basel III advance common equity Tier 1 ratio stayed flat at 15.8%. Our pro forma fully phased in supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter increased to 6.3%.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $1 billion of common stock or approximately 27 million shares, and our Board declared a $0.20 dividend per share. For the full year, we repurchased $3.5 billion of common stock or approximately 117 million shares, compared with $2.1 billion or approximately 59 million shares in 2015.","Our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 25.2%, including the $135 million discrete tax benefit. For the full year excluding net discrete items, our tax rate was approximately 32%. As wealth management continues to become a larger percentage of our PBT, we would expect our tax rate to drift higher towards 33% in 2017 and we would expect our tax rate to continue to exhibit quarter to quarter volatility. Of course, all of this is subject to U.S. corporate tax reform.","As James discussed, we started 2016 with five strategic objectives to be achieved over two years, and we have made solid progress on all of them. We are on track to achieve our 2017 ROE target of 9% to 11%. Although the revenue environment was challenging in the first quarter of the year, we were able to position ourselves well for 2017 and beyond. We did this by improving our cost discipline and executing strategic initiatives, including our bank strategy and our fixed income restructuring, while retaining leadership positions in areas of traditional strength of equities and investment banking.","Recently, increased investor optimism and more constructive markets are positive signs for our businesses. As always, changes in macro and geopolitical factors can have meaningful impact to market sentiment, but for now we are encouraged by the increased confidence of market participants.","With that, we will open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Guy Moszkowski","Thanks, good morning. As you pointed out, you met a lot of your objectives for the year, and I guess it points to the question specifically in fixed income, given that you\u2019ve maintained that target at $4 billion, or a billion dollars quarterly, and even in what was a terrible year last year, you managed 4.3, I think, and this year you did 5.1. It kind of begs the question of whether you wouldn\u2019t raise your sights on that.","James Gorman","You know, Guy, these were targets we put in place a year ago for 2017. We\u2019ve seen a lot of cycles in fixed income. We\u2019ve had a lot of people questioning our strategy over the last several years. I think we feel pretty good about what we did in restructuring the business. I think the new team bringing together with equities obviously was a very positive move there, and we\u2019d just like to see it play out a little bit. There\u2019s no point getting ahead of ourselves at this point. Most of our peer companies do not put out such specific goals as we do, and I don\u2019t feel like we should be updating them every year. Let\u2019s see it play out.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay, fair enough. By the same token, looking at Slide 13 where you show 23% to 25% margin target in wealth management and then you\u2019ve got a question mark on 2018 and 2019, it looks as if you\u2019ve drawn the 2018 bar a bit higher, though. Maybe you can give us the thought process there and what you might aspire to by the end of the year.","James Gorman","You have remarkable good eyesight, Guy. I had not noticed that graphic detail. You know, I think it\u2019s fair to say if you took this chart back even further, our pre-tax margin in the mid-2005 and \u201906 range was around 3%. The scale economics of the business are sort of unshakeable, and building out the bank side has obviously given that a huge kick. What\u2019s been missing has been the retail investor, what has been missing has been the new issue calendar in the last several months, and what has been missing has been interest rates. If those things happen, just from the position we are in now, we feel obviously strongly about the target for this year. If those things happen, there\u2019s obviously additional upside, and that\u2019s exactly right - that\u2019s what the question marks were meant to evidence, not exactly the line on the graph, but I take your point. We feel as good about this business as we\u2019ve felt for a long, long time.","Guy Moszkowski","Fair enough, and thanks for that. Maybe I can just follow up on one of the items that you mentioned there in terms of interest rate sensitivity. Your interest rate sensitivity disclosure feels somewhat mechanistic - it\u2019s just on the bank. I was wondering if you had maybe a more holistic view for wealth management in particular as to what, say, a parallel shift in the yield curve of 25 or 50 basis points should do, all other things equal for the wealth management business.","Jonathan Pruzan","Let me try and take that one, Guy. I think as you point out, the wealth business and the NII in that business is clearly the most sensitive to rates. I think last year, we told you that the growth in NII - and I can\u2019t remember what slide it is - but we showed you that in wealth, it went from $3 billion to $3.5 billion. That was really driven by deposit deployment and the growth in the lending balances. I think what we\u2019re saying for 2017 is that we still expect NII growth, albeit at a somewhat slower pace, and it\u2019s probably going to be more mixed in terms of where that comes from.","We still have some room to play out in the deposit deployment strategy. We still feel good about our lending balances - they went from 48 to 60, we would expect to continue to grow the loan balances. Clearly mortgage will probably slow down a little bit given the increase in rates, but SBL and the tailored lending product continues to show good growth, so we\u2019ll see some average earning asset growth that will drive that.","Then lastly, this year we do expect to get a little bit of a lift from rates, particularly if the forward curve is realized. I can\u2019t exactly remember, but in the first quarter of \u201916, I think the forward curve was showing maybe one or half a rate increase. Now we obviously have two rate increases, and to the degree that those get realized, that will clearly help that NII line in wealth.","Guy Moszkowski","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and as a reminder ladies and gentlemen [Operator Instructions]. In the interest of time, we do ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. You may then re-enter the queue by pressing star, one again for any further questions.","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Chubak with Nomura. Your line is now open.","Steve Chubak","Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask a follow-up relating to Jon, your last remarks concerning ROE targets for 2017. You\u2019d previously indicated at the last strategic update that hitting the 9% was really contingent on delivering mid-single digit revenue growth per year, and it looks like consensus is modeling somewhere closer to low single digit, so instead of your 3% to 5%, somewhere closer to 2%. But given the significant progress you\u2019ve made on the cost side, I\u2019m just wondering whether you can still hit the 9% even if revenue outlook materializes more in line with consensus.","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. I think that if you recall, one of the slides, we started with a 7% ROE. We said a billion dollars of expenses should add about 100 basis points of ROE, and therefore the revenue growth was going to generate the difference. We still feel very good about the target. We still have more progress to make on the expense side, and we would expect to keep those expenses out of the business, so the operational leverage on those revenues is pretty good.","So again, I think in light of the last three quarters that we\u2019ve put up close to $9 billion and sort of, as James said, on average about an 8.5% ROE, we see a clear line of sight to that 9 to 11, and we feel pretty confident about it.","Steve Chubak","Got it, and just one quick follow-up relating to the wealth management comp guidance you guys have given. Just looking at the business, the comp ratio did tick down slightly this year, about 50 BPs, so continuing to grind that lower, but admittedly the mix, particularly towards higher margin NII, would have suggested that maybe we should have seen a little bit more progress. James, you actually alluded to some of the competitive dynamics in your prepared remarks that could drive intensifying competition. Just wanted to get a sense as to what factors have impacted your ability to drive more meaningful comp leverage, and maybe how much incremental margin upside we could see from higher rates, alluding to Guy\u2019s question about the rising column chart in terms of margin progress beyond 2017.","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, in terms of the rate question, I\u2019ll answer that. We did increase NII $500 million in that business, or more than $500 million in that business last year. We would expect to continue to grow NII, not--it\u2019s obviously a bigger number and so growth rates will slow down, but we feel very good about the margin and the net interest income opportunity, and that will clearly drive an increase in our margin. We were 22 and change for the year, so again we have clear line of sight into that 23 to 25 level.","James Gorman","I\u2019d just say on the comp ratio quickly, you know, I think it\u2019s clearly encouraging. It\u2019s heading in the direction that we all want. At the same time, we are making some investments in the business. I mean, the bank build-out is critical, and we\u2019ve got to be careful that we\u2019re not pennywise and pound foolish here. We need to invest behind the bank, we need to invest behind that digital strategy, we need to invest behind upgrading the technology and the branch system, and we\u2019ve been investing behind our marketing efforts there.","So you know, while we could probably accelerate the comp ratio decline, I\u2019m not sure that would be good for the medium and long-term growth of the business, which we\u2019re all focused on at the same time.","Steve Chubak","And how far along are you in terms of those investments? Are they largely completed at this point, or should we expect that to be ongoing?","James Gorman","No, I don\u2019t want to overstate them; they\u2019re just--it\u2019s part and parcel of running good business. You\u2019re always investing in your business. The business mix itself will dictate a decline in the comp ratio, as will further growth because the incremental expense costs on the further revenue growth are obviously relatively attractive.","Steve Chubak","Thanks so much for taking my questions.","James Gorman","Sure.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is now open.","Mike Mayo","Hi, I just want a clarification. Your ROE target of 9 to 11% is for the calendar year 2017, and it\u2019s not contingent on anything right now. You\u2019re committed to getting to that ROE?","James Gorman","Well Mike, I think when we set that target, and we stand by it, it was contingent upon three things, as you\u2019ll recall. I think it was the last page of the presentation a year ago. one of them was 3 to 5% revenue growth, one of them was continued progress on our capital return, because obviously ROE is a function of both the equity and the earnings, and the third was no one-time large enforcement-slash-litigation--you know, financial crisis-type events. This year, we saw zero revenue growth, or maybe 1%, I think. We saw no one-time large-slash-enforcement litigation events, and we were able to increase our capital, but we still accreted capital interestingly. Even with our capital increase, we\u2019re not at 100% payout.","You know, we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll be above 9%. Obviously if there\u2019s a very difficult revenue environment this year, we stand by our original predictions that we\u2019re subject to, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to need to be at the 3 to 5% revenue growth to get there, but certainly if we had a negative revenue environment, that\u2019d be a different issue.","Mike Mayo","Then as far as your progress in trading, you\u2019re gaining market share in equities for sure, and it looks like a little bit in fixed income. Is that from U.S. banks or European banks, and if it\u2019s in European banks, is that the sustainable?","Jonathan Pruzan","So Mike, yes--I mean, as you said, we put up over $8 billion in equities and $5 billion in fixed income. The equity pool in terms of the revenue or the wallet looks like it will shrink for the year - we haven\u2019t seen everyone\u2019s results yet, and we had the opposite phenomenon in fixed income where it looks like the pools have been getting a little bit bigger sort of quarter to quarter.","In terms of where that share is coming from, it\u2019s sort of hard to discern, but I would say one of the things that we\u2019ve been very proud of and very focused on is keeping the global network intact as we restructured and changed our businesses around the globe, and I think that global network is accruing benefits to us as we\u2019ve seen others around the globe sort of disrupted or distracted, based on the events going on. So unclear if it\u2019s coming from any particular competitor, but we do feel good about the shares that we have and the momentum we have in those businesses.","Mike Mayo","And then last follow-up, James, you mentioned the 10-year retention for wealth management personnel. Can you just summarize what that\u2019s about and when that could impact results?","James Gorman","When we did the deal, Mike, in I believe it was closed in the early--mid-January of 2009, we did the deal, we put in place a retention program which is not uncommon for these kind of transactions, particularly when you\u2019re moving financial advisors across platforms and creating a reasonable amount of disruption at that point in time. We moved all of the financial advisors ultimately onto a new platform, those from the original Dean Witter franchise, those from Morgan Stanley, and those from Smith Barney. The net impact was several thousand financial advisors at that point were given a deal, a retention deal depending on size of business, shaped sort of the nature of the deal. It\u2019s amortized over nine years, I believe - nine or 10 years, I think it\u2019s nine years. The last year of amortization, the expiration of it is in January of 2018, if memory serves me, so--","Jonathan Pruzan","Nineteen.","James Gorman","Maybe it\u2019s \u201919. We\u2019ll clarify that - I think it\u2019s \u201919. So we\u2019ve got two years left of the nine-year deal. Some of those financial advisors in the meantime have retired; a small number have moved onto other employment, so the annual amortization rate is probably not exactly the same year by year, but it\u2019s a meaningful number. We finish with that in two years\u2019 time. We\u2019ve been paying it for seven years so far and we\u2019ve got two years left, but then it\u2019s done.","Mike Mayo","Right, thank you.","James Gorman","Sure.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks. On the $17 billion of fee-based flows, I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s any new client money in there, or is that all a result of conversion of current client? Within that, I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s just all-natural progression as you\u2019ve basically doubled the fee-based assets over the last seven years, and where you think that natural resting ground will be as DOL may be coming into play in a couple months.","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. I think for the first question, it is a mix of both, some new assets as well as existing assets. I think we\u2019ve always said that we think there\u2019s a secular trend going on here long-term, that people are moving towards fee-based accounts and want to have that choice or use that mechanism at an account level, as opposed to a brokerage account, so this is a trend, as you said, that we\u2019ve seen for quite some time. We would expect it to continue. We\u2019re now at 42% of client assets are in fee-based accounts. We continue to believe that that number can go higher and expect it to drift higher as we--as time continues to play out.","What the natural or what the ending point is, is unclear, but we still think there is room above 42.","Glenn Schorr","While we\u2019re on that topic, let\u2019s just say that DOL goes as planned, meaning there\u2019s no dilution, there\u2019s no delay. Does the April 10 deadline, is that an event that changes behavior ahead of it on this fee-based discussion, or is it just natural progression, the date is just the start date?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, I think it\u2019s hard to sort of parse out why people are changing. We\u2019re clearly positioned to be in compliance with the rule if it goes into effect on April 10. What we\u2019ve always said is we want to give our clients choice, so they will have choice to either move into a fee-based account or stay, and therefore this is about client preference, and we\u2019re happy to see how it plays out.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. One quick one here on ROE, or actually it might not be all that quick. So I get it that there is some uncertainty in the revenue environment, but you guys highlighted it seems like momentum continues to improve, specifically FIC looks stable, exceeding targets with lower capital, equities strong, and II starting to benefit from rate uplift, and risk appetite is expanding and transactional revenues are starting to improve in wealth management. So--and then finally, we\u2019ve got the outlook for potential changes from a new administration that\u2019s highlighted regulation and a desire to cut back.","So in light of all that, how should we think about the ROE guide? It certainly seems like the low end given those factors would be quite easy for you, and how should we think about that new administration and potential benefits from lesser regulatory burdens?","James Gorman","Well Brennan, I think you just outlaid the bull case. The bear case would be the retail investor doesn\u2019t engage, there\u2019s a geopolitical or political event which creates enough confusion in the minds of potential issuers that the underwriting calendar doesn\u2019t come back, the M&A pipeline for whatever reason does not crystallize, given some of the changes on the political front, including potential tax reform, et cetera. So you know, I think--listen, we\u2019re all working hard here to get the ROE up higher. We have been explicit in setting a range and a time frame for that range. Again, I don\u2019t know that our--that is being common practice among our competitor set, but we did it and we\u2019re very comfortable with that range.","So you know, if we have the high class problem you\u2019ve laid out, which we all hope we do, terrific - we\u2019ll generate a higher return than we might have estimated at the low end. But let\u2019s see that play out over time.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Your line is now open.","Andrew Lim","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if we could return to the NII sensitivity. It would be nice to get some measure of how much your NII would increase for, say, a 100 basis point parallel upward shift in the curve. I think you did something along those lines in the 1Q fixed income presentation last year, so perhaps you can give an update on that. And then just together with that, perhaps give a sense of how sensitive you are to the short end increasing versus the long end - are you predominantly sensitive to the short end increasing and then hoping that that short end increases in tandem with what the curve is indicating?","Then--sorry, just a second question, if I may. Your CET1 ratio was virtually unchanged on the quarter despite the strong earnings, and I was just wondering if you could talk a bit more about any negative OCI impacts coming from [indiscernible] valuation adjustments. Could you also talk about how you view excess capital? I think [indiscernible] on the same page as seen as having a lot of excess capital, but the question mark is how much? What are you waiting for in terms of having that return to shareholders - more clarity on the regulatory front, maybe the stress capital buffer becoming more a tangible part of capital ratios? If you could talk about that a bit more, that\u2019d be great.","James Gorman","Hey Andrew, that\u2019s a lot of questions for one question, and glad to see we came out with your recent research. I\u2019m going to let Jon answer maybe one of these and we can follow up offline.","Jonathan Pruzan","I\u2019ll pick one. So I think--as you know, on the capital return, we just re-submitted our CCAR submission. We\u2019ll wait to hear back from them. We continue to increase our capital return. In our disclosure, you can see what we have in parent capital, and we would like to continue--as our earnings grow, we would like to continue to return more capital to shareholders.","The second point I would make on your Tier 1, I think it was your CET 1 question, it\u2019s just around we had--our buyback and our preferred and common dividends sort of offset our earnings, and then you saw a movement in our AOTI. We have about a $60 billion AFS portfolio throughout the organization, and that caused about a $700 million, give or take, after-tax impact. So all the earnings net of the buybacks and the dividends and the AOTI sort of ended up in a flat place.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Michael Carrier","Right, thanks guys. Just a few on wealth management, and some of these are just clean-ups; but I think, Jon, you mentioned some expense items in this quarter. I think it was related to something on tax, something--some tax issues, but I just wanted to make sure we had that amount, if you had it. Then on the net interest income, any color on, just given the strength in the quarter, how much was maybe non-core, like prepayment, stuff like that? And I think in the past, you\u2019ve mentioned--I think it was 150 basis points, it was like $1.1 billion TBT, but any update just on the sensitivity there?","Jonathan Pruzan","Right, I\u2019ll go backwards. I don\u2019t recall the 1.1 comment, so I don\u2019t think that came from me. In terms of the other questions--I\u2019m sorry, start again, go back?","Michael Carrier","Yeah, it was just the expense item. I think you mentioned there was something in wealth management.","Jonathan Pruzan","Yeah. I think we-- as you can see from the non-comp expenses, that gives you a sense of sort of the magnitude. The full-year TBT was 22. We feel good about the 23 to 25% margin in that business going forward, and we took a provision this quarter to address those issues that we\u2019ve identified.","What was the other question? I\u2019m sorry.","Michael Carrier","No, that was fine. I just didn\u2019t know if there was a--if you sized it. The other one was just on the rate sensitivity.","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes again, I think we are--we feel good about our rate position. We are at the sensitive. Duration in the bank is still--if you look at the bank in totality, it\u2019s still under two years. We saw one increase in the end of \u201915, we saw one increase at the end of \u201916, so we have started to get a little bit of uplift in terms of the return on our cash and on our short-term securities. The mortgage origination pipeline is still pretty good. New mortgages are being written at higher rates, so we\u2019ll get the benefit of that. The duration in that portfolio extended a little bit out; but again, we feel good about NII growth in the bank. You will see that in the results in the wealth management business, that we\u2019ve taken that number from under $2 billion a couple years ago to $3.5 billion in NII, and we would expect that to continue to grow, and that will obviously help the margin in that business.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Devin Ryan","Thanks. Good morning James, Jon. A couple quick ones here. So in wealth management, just wanted to follow up on James\u2019 comment about one leg of the strategy as a move towards focusing on clients that are interested in a full digital relationship. Just curious if we should think about that as maybe expanding the customer base to smaller levels of investable assets, just because those will become more economic. Just trying to think about what that comment means.","James Gorman","Well you know, I think that there has obviously been an evolution in this industry, and there\u2019s clear market segments. The vast majority of clients that we deal with and aspire to deal with are people who are attracted to the intellectual capital and product offerings that a firm like Morgan Stanley has, so we have disproportionately much larger households among our 2, $2.1 trillion of assets, a very large percentage of them in household above $10 million, and again between 1 and $10 million that we\u2019ll be building a lot of digital technology to support the financial advisors and the branch operations and delivering online capability and services to those clients.","At the same time, there are clients who want to deal with a digital-only platform, and we\u2019re sort of reserving the option to serve that client base. We don\u2019t think in the certainly short, medium, maybe even long term it\u2019s going to be a large part of our business - that\u2019s not our presumption. We\u2019re not a pure online or direct player, but we have that capability.","I think the biggest opportunity, however, exists with providing online capability to existing clients who want a multi-channel relationship with us.","Devin Ryan","Got it, okay. That\u2019s great color. Then just staying on TWM, looks like a slight downtick in FA headcount. On the other hand, you had, it looks like, a record quarter of productivity, which was good to see. Just curious if you can give any thoughts around headcount trends from here, the outlook for recruiting? I suspect maybe the deal wells had a load of negative impact on that, but curious where we go from here.","Jonathan Pruzan","Yeah, listen - I think as you know, the FA headcount bounces around a little bit. I think we\u2019re comfortable with the levels that we are at, and it probably is sort of in and around this level. We have seen a slowdown in recruiting, both in terms of ins and outs. The net impact has been a little bit, as you see here, a little bit of attrition; but again, I think this is sort of a level that we\u2019re comfortable with and that the recruiting environment has certainly slowed down over the last couple quarters here.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. So my question is basically about the levers to--in which optimized can be--you know, capital can be more fully optimized. I guess the two parts of my question are, on the one hand, as long as the CCAR process exists, obviously there will be constraints on how much capital presumably can be returned in any given period of time; and on the other hand, you\u2019ve sort of right-sized your fixed footprint and so it\u2019s now consuming less RWA than it has historically. So is there anything that can be done in which RWA can be generated in a way that consumes this capital and accretes then to revenue, that\u2019s different than what the current experience is?","Jonathan Pruzan","The way I would think about it is as we generate capital, we\u2019ve said we have sufficient capital, so we\u2019d like to keep it stable. To the degree it accretes, which it did accrete over the course of the year, we can try to continue to support our client base. We have capital capacity to increase our balance sheet if the opportunity presents itself, so that\u2019s certainly an opportunity that we haven\u2019t seen in the past. Clearly over the last couple years, our balance sheet has sort of been flat to down, but as we see some increased activity and client activity across the globe, there is an opportunity to invest that back into our core businesses, so that\u2019s another area that potentially looks like there could be an opportunity this year, whereas I would say last year it didn\u2019t feel like we were in that same spot.","Eric Wasserstrom","Got it, so that was actually my follow-up. So it sounds like in \u201917, you think there might be a bit more opportunity for balance sheet growth?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, I think we enter this year with more of a half-full optimism, as opposed to if you recall in the first quarter of last year when we set out these targets and these guidelines. We were in a very different and difficult environment, and it was a very much half-empty environment with sort of disruption and not really functioning markets. Today, markets are open and functioning, and there is this new sense of optimism. So if that continues, there should be potentially opportunity to increase the size of the balance sheet.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Fiona Swaffield","Hi, good afternoon. I have two questions. The first was in the past, Morgan Stanley has talked about the deposit beta within wealth management, and there\u2019s--I remember a number of 45 for 100 basis points. I wonder whether you could update us on that, whether that\u2019s changed, because it\u2019s some time since you\u2019ve talked about it.","The second area was Brexit strategy. Wonder if you could talk again about where you\u2019re going on that front and what your options could be if there is a, as it looks like, a single market exit. Thank you.","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. On the beta question, there\u2019s obviously been a lot of discussion around betas, mostly because we\u2019re now in an environment of rising rates where we haven\u2019t seen one in eight years, so everyone is sort of using models that are based on historical practices, and we obviously have seen also money market reform and some changes in the structure of the markets. I would say in terms of how we think about our beta today, Fiona, again I think my comments have generally been that we think the beta is about 50, and I think we still are comfortable that that\u2019s a reasonable effort--excuse me, a reasonable estimate. Realized betas on the first two hikes have clearly been lower, but we think 50 is probably as good an estimate as any, and we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out and what actually happens to rates.","James Gorman","Just on Brexit, Fiona, I think given the PM\u2019s speech this morning, we\u2019d probably need a little more time to digest. This is a bit of a moving chessboard here. We like the U.K., we like the rule of law in the U.K., we like having our businesses there, and our aspiration is to keep as much of our business there as possible; but to the extent we have to comply with obviously the Brexit rules, we\u2019ll be putting a headquarters somewhere in continental Europe, and that will have some implications going forward. But it\u2019s a little early at this point. Let\u2019s digest what she said this morning, and we\u2019ll be meeting with them over the next week or so.","Fiona Swaffield","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Hi. There has been a lot of focus on the asset sensitivity within the wealth management unit specifically, but I was wondering if you could comment on how the overall balance sheet is positioned for rising rates, including the institutional securities unit and investment management. Just thinking about the aggregate balance sheet.","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, well I think that most of the--most of that sensitivity is in wealth, and will sort of be seen in that segment reporting wealth line. The institutional securities business, as you\u2019ve tracked in the segment reporting, NII is not really how we think about that business, nor in sort of how it plays out in light of the sales and trading nature of that business.","Broadly speaking, rising rates in terms of what that is as a function of global growth rates and\/or volatility will impact the sales and trading business; but again, most of the sensitivity lies within our wealth business because most of the assets outside of wealth are floating rate assets matched with floating rate liabilities.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, and then the follow-up, just in the institutional securities, we saw the net interest income there go down; but is that more just the mix shift in terms of how clients are paying more in fees versus the interest income, or is there more of a liability sensitive position there?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, I think it\u2019s very hard to look at net interest income in ISG, particularly the sales and trading businesses. As you know, we\u2019re carrying inventories, we\u2019re trading positions. NII is created a lot of different ways. It\u2019s not really how we look at that business, so the wealth is the real area you\u2019ll see impact.","James Gorman","I think we\u2019re going to take a couple more questions. We\u2019re running a little overtime here, there\u2019s been a long queue. We\u2019ll take a couple more and then we\u2019ll shut it down.","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Bove with Rafferty Capital. Your line is now open.","Richard Bove","Thank you. You had a very impressive quarter in terms of earnings growth, clearly, in the fourth quarter, but at the end of the day your common equity was down, which has been true of every one of the major universal banks. I\u2019m just wondering, if interest rates are expected to rise on a continuous basis, I guess, certainly 2017 and beyond, how do you get common equity to go up?","Jonathan Pruzan","So, how do we get common equity to go up? We\u2019re actually trying to keep common equity flat, as we think we have sufficient capital to run our businesses based on the current size, shape and risk profile of the company. We have been increasing our capital return to try to achieve that. As you point out, this quarter we were impacted by a movement in our AFS portfolio, as well as some movements in DBA as our credit spreads tightened. Those movements are going to be volatile depending on what happens to rates and what happens to spreads; but again, our goal here is to try to keep capital pretty flat going forward.","Richard Bove","Yeah, but if interest rates keep rising and if the impact is similar to what you saw in the fourth quarter, your common equity is going to continue to fall. If your common equity continues to fall, in answer to an earlier question you indicated that you\u2019d be able to expand the size of the balance sheet to take advantage of new opportunities, but you won\u2019t be able to do that if you can\u2019t get common equity to stabilize or rise in a rising interest rate environment.","In other words, you may be able to get an increased benefit in terms of asset sensitivity from some of your business lines, but from the balance sheet as a whole, the piggybank is smaller today, or let\u2019s say December 31, than it was on September 30. How do people benefit if the piggybank keeps getting smaller?","Jonathan Pruzan","Well again, I think we did accrete capital, average capital and absolute capital over the course of 2016. We started the beginning of the year 2016 saying that we were capital sufficient, so we have more capital than when we made those comments, so we can continue to leverage that capital. Our capital--our average equity was down $400 million, I think, quarter over quarter, so again on a roughly $70 billion base, it wasn\u2019t a dramatic decline. We still have more capital today than we did at December 31, and we continue to believe we have capital capacity to invest in our business and grow our business.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Matt Burnell","Thanks for taking my question. Two relatively quick ones, I hope. First of all, Jon, in investment management, obviously the fourth quarter numbers were a little bit skewed by the loss, but first of all, can you tell us a little more detail as to why you took those charges, and in the bigger picture you\u2019re still above the 40% target for comp to net revenues in that business, and how confident are you, you can get to that by 2017?","Jonathan Pruzan","All right, I\u2019ll take--let me take the first one first. As we said, these were non-core investments. They were capital intensive. They were limited partner investments - this was money that we didn\u2019t manage, nor had we invested. They were investments that were made going on 10 years ago when we made the risk decision to exit those positions, and we did and sort of took the charge that you saw in the fourth quarter of $60 million. So absent that charge, obviously better results in that business - stable asset fees, stable asset management fees, and would have been a better investment line was it not for that charge that we took. Again, those were decisions based on--risk decisions that we decided to exit those positions.","In terms of the comp ratio, to be fair, as you know, carry runs through that line item, so the comp ratio target that we put out there, it\u2019s really quite volatile and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to--you know, depending on what the investment environment is, it sort of perverts if we have a lot of carry gains. We won\u2019t meet our target, yet our income will be a lot higher, so that target is probably one that we won\u2019t meet depending on the investment environment.","The one thing I will tell you is that if you look at--you don\u2019t have the ability to parse this through the different line items, but the non-carry related comp expense is actually down as a percentage of the fee-based revenue, so we are exhibiting good expense discipline in that business, but it will be volatile based on carry and investment gains. So not a great target that we had out there, and probably one that we\u2019re just going to be focused on the discipline around the non-carry related comp.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Jim Mitchell","Hey, good morning. You guys have made great progress on the FIC RWAs, I think almost at your end state already, well ahead of schedule. Just before you stop disclosing it, can you just kind of walk us through on the SLR side? I think you still are less than halfway to your end state. Why is that slower than the RWA side, and is the end state still your target and how do we get there?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, we\u2019ve obviously--from the slide that James put up, when we announced the restructuring, we\u2019ve taken the FIC RWAs down from 158 to below 120, which as you said was our 2017 target. SLR, we\u2019ve also made some great progress from 417 down into the 340s. I think the difference, you\u2019re seeing obviously more liquid products, so in terms of leverage assets versus RWAs, that\u2019s one of the drivers. We feel good about the size of this business. We feel good about the results of this business, and again we\u2019re going to still manage this business aggressively but we\u2019re just not going to be really seeing those individual targets, as we think that the size of this business is appropriate.","Jim Mitchell","So what you\u2019re saying is where you are from an SLR perspective today is you\u2019re not going to get much more progress from here?","Jonathan Pruzan","No, I\u2019m saying we\u2019re going to continue to try to make progress in those line items, but--and we feel good that there are probably some more opportunities. We have taken them down pretty dramatically from the 417 into the 340s, so we think there is still some optimization there; but we feel good about the size of this business and the results that its generated.","Operator","Thank you, and that concludes the question and answer session.

This is Celeste Brown, Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Call.

The presentation may also include certain non-GAAP financial measures.

This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","","James Gorman","Thank you, Celeste. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, the fruits of our strategy were evident. Despite a challenging quarter for markets, our results demonstrated consistency and durability of our business models. Our EPS, excluding DVA and the charge for the wealth management acquisition last year, was up sequentially in a seasonally weaker quarter and with higher legal expenses. More important, however, we remain focused on our long-term objectives.","Starting with Institutional Securities, our results underscore the power of our integrated models. Our outstanding leadership and equity sales and trading again benefited us this quarter and we generated our highest revenues in the third quarter since 2008. We continue to be first or second globally with our continued success driven by the focus on clients, the sustained investments in technology and targeted investments in certain areas of the business. In investment banking, the focus we have placed on improving our wallet share in certain areas has paid dividends as growth and our market share increase in debt underwriting offset lower market wide advisory and equity underwriting volumes. Cross border activity continues to be a dominant theme and Morgan Stanley remains the number one ranked firm in terms of cross border advisory activity benefiting from the strength of our global client franchise.","The cohesiveness of our model was illustrated by the Verizon deal where we are leading one of the biggest M&A transactions in history but also co-led the $12 billion bank loans syndication and the $49 billion senior note offerings. At growing deposit base provided us with an important additional tool in this transaction. We also remain focused on ROE in the fixed income and commodities business and continuously evaluate every aspect of what we\u2019re doing. We stayed very close to home in regards to risk in third quarter due to the liquid markets and this is evidenced both by our average and period end VAR.","We continue to reduce risk weighted assets in the business and in the third quarter at 213 billion. Recalled that this number now excludes the IWA is associated with lending. However, we\u2019re investing in other areas of fixed income that are core to our future including our people and technology. Turning now to wealth management, the third quarter was the first full quarter during which we owned a 100% of the business and we are just beginning to see the benefits. Despite seasonality and a relatively subdued trading environment revenues were essentially flat and we improved our margins and profitability once again. The revenues and margins were supported or driven by some of the benefits of the acquisition. Elimination of the order flow agreement and continued growth in net interest income both of which generate high incremental revenues and higher incremental margins I should say now traditional advice and commission revenues. In addition we retained a 100% of the earnings associated with the business. Obviously increasing net income to the firm from wealth management in this case by over 30% sequentially.","As we have discussed with you in the past, this business and the acquisition will continue to drive upside for the firm and it's stakeholders as we prudently deploy the balance of the deposits from our former partner over the next several years in both wealth management and institutional securities. We can generate attractive ROEs on the assets supporting the deposits in the retail and institutional businesses even in the low rate environment and without reaching for risk. This is due to the relatively low funding cost, the lack of bricks and mortar and our embedded client base.","While we do not discuss investment management frequently it's earnings contribution continues to grow in absolute terms. We have been very pleased with the investment and financial performance of our traditional investment management real estate and merchant banking businesses.","The continued progress in regards to performance coupled with disciplined expense management drove the highest PBT in that business since 2010. We remain focused on our expense programs more broadly and continued to make progress towards our goals although the results are less evident this quarter because of elevated legal expenses. We expect to meet or exceed our expense targets excluding litigation. In the meantime however we will continue to reap the benefits of our strategy leveraging our world class franchises upside from wealth management and deposit growth, intense focus on expense management and thoughtful capital allocation. As you would expect we began buying back stock in the quarter. This is the first time since 2008 and we look forward to increasing capital returns to shareholders overtime. I will now turn the call over to Ruth.","","Ruth Porat","Good morning I\u2019ll provide both gap results and results excluding the effect of DBA. We have provided reconciliations in the foot notes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures. The impact of DVA in the quarter was negative 171 million with 141 million in fixed income, sales and trading and 30 million in equity sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were 8.1 billion down approximately 3% versus the second quarter.","The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the third quarter was 25.3% inclusive of a discreet benefit. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders, excluding DVA, were approximately $983 million. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share, excluding DVA, were $0.50 after preferred dividends. On a GAAP basis, including the impact of DVA, firm wide revenues for the quarter were $7.9 billion. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $862 million. Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.44 after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was $32.13 per share, up 2% versus the second quarter. Tangible book value was $26.96 per share, up 3% sequentially.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our total assets were $832 billion at September 30 up versus last quarter due primarily to the growth in our deposits pursuant to the contractual agreement associated with the acquisition of the remainder of the wealth management business. Specifically, deposits as of quarter end were $105 billion, up $23 billion versus 2Q of which $21 billion was due to on-boarding of deposits from our former JV partner and the remainder was from organic deposit growth. Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $198 billion compared with $181 billion at the end of the second quarter. The increase was also driven higher by the recently on-boarded deposits, most of which have not yet been deployed thus resulting in elevated levels of bank liquidity. Our non-bank liquidity level also remains elevated.","Turning to capital. Although our calculations are not final, we believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel 1 will be approximately 12.6% and our Tier 1 capital ratio will be approximately 15.3%. Risk-weighted assets under Basel 1 and including the final market risk rules are expected to be approximately $386 billion at September 30. Reflecting our best estimate of the final Federal Reserve rules, our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was 10.8% as of the end of the third quarter.","Pro forma risk-weighted assets under Basel III are estimated to be $414 billion. We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio to be around 4.2%. This estimate reflects the United States proposed regulatory rules for the numerator and the denominator and is subject to change if rules evolve. Our ratio was consistent with second quarter levels despite no longer reflecting the benefit of clearing as a deduction from the denominator and the increase in deposits in the quarter, which on a combined basis, reduced the ratio by over 30 basis points. We continued to expect to exceed the required 5% level in 2015 including an assumption for a greater return of capital to shareholders.","Turning to expenses. Total expenses this quarter were $6.6 billion, down 2% versus the second quarter. Compensation expense was down 3%. Non-compensation expense was flat to 2Q notwithstanding higher litigation expenses, which have been elevated since last year and were higher in the third quarter and in each of the first and second quarters.","Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, revenues, excluding DVA, were $3.9 billion, down 8% sequentially. Non-interest expense was $3.3 billion, down 2% versus the second quarter. Compensation was $1.6 billion for the third quarter, down 8% versus the second quarter, reflecting a 42% ratio excluding DVA. Non-compensation expense of $1.7 billion increased 5% from last quarter, driven by higher litigation expenses and a catch up for the Fed\u2019s 50 assessment of approximately $25 million, which covers all of 2012 and the first three quarters of 2013 partially offset by a decrease in activity related costs. The business reported a pre-tax profit of $542 million, excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact of DVA, pre-tax profit was $371 million.","In Investment Banking, revenues of $992 million were down 8% versus last quarter. Results were driven by continuing strong debt new issuance activity and our integrated efforts across Institutional Securities. More generally, according to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked Number 3 in global completed M&A, Number 4 in announced M&A, Number 3 in global IPOs and global equity at the end of the third quarter. In addition to Verizon which James mentioned in his opening remarks notable transactions included in advisory through our Japanese Joint Venture Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley we acted as exclusive financial advisory to Tokyo Electron on it's merger with Applied Materials, Japan\u2019s first all stop cross border merger. In equity underwriting Morgan Stanley acted as lead joint global coordinator for the 2.5 billion follow on equity offerings for Grupo Financiero Banorte, the largest Mexican Stock Offering of the year.","And in debt underwriting Morgan Stanley served as joint active book runner on the General Motors 4.5 billion debt offering it's first major placement since the emerging from bankruptcy protection as well as sole book runner on the financing for the previously announced acquisition of Smithfield Foods. Advisory revenues of 275 million were down 17% versus our second quarter results driven by decreased revenues in EMEA. Equity underwriting revenues were 236 million down 28% versus the second quarter driven by lower results in both the Americas and Asia-Pacific.","Fixed income underwriting revenues were 481 million up 15% versus the second quarter driven by investment grade and loan syndication fees. Equity sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were 1.7 billion a decrease of 5% from last quarter. Results were strong across geographies and products evidencing less seasonality and it's typical for the third quarter. Derivatives revenues increased sequentially as strong risk management offset the summer slowdown in certain products. And brokerage balances remained relatively constant from the second quarter also blocking the typical summer trend. Although revenue was down due to seasonality in Europe.","Cash revenues declined modestly though held up better than industry volumes. Fixed income and commodity sales and trading revenues excluding DVA were 835 million. Revenues declined with broader market activity, client volumes, market liquidity and thus overall risk levels were generally low driven primarily by macro-products. DVA was also a drag in the quarter due to the tightening of our credit spread and was a significant driven of sequential revenue change. Credit products revenues increased despite the challenging environment. Commodities revenues were up modestly driven by higher client activity.","Investment revenues of 337 million were up significantly versus the second quarter driven predominantly by the sale of insurance broker hub. Average trading bar for the third quarter was 52 million versus 61 million in the second quarter driven by low levels of risk taking throughout the quarter in fixed income and commodities. Turning to Wealth Management, revenues were 3.5 billion in the third quarter. Asset management revenue of 1.9 billion were flat to last quarter reflecting the benefit of higher market levels at the beginning of the quarter but offset by lower deposit referral fees from our former JV partner. These fees declined pro-rata with the deposits that were on-boarded in the third quarter.","Transaction revenues decreased 4% from last quarter consisting primarily of commissions of 507 million which were down a 11% versus the prior quarter due to seasonality and generally subdued activity. Investment banking related fees of 185 million which were down 28% versus last quarter reflecting lower activity in closed-end funds and partially offset by higher trading revenues of 317 million which were up 42% versus the second quarter reflecting higher DCP as well as the benefit of elimination of the order flow agreement with our JV partner now that we are on 100% of wealth management. Net interest revenue increased 11% to 493 million driven primarily by retiring a preferred security and the JV concurrent with our acquisition of the remainder of the wealth management business as well as growth in our lending product. Other revenue decreased sequentially to 75 million from 139 million.","Last quarter this line reflected revenue from the sale of a business as well as [indiscernible] gains that did not repeat this quarter. Non-interest expense was 2.8 billion flat to last quarter the compensation ratio was 58% flat to the second quarter. Non-compensation expense was $796 million, down 5% versus last quarter due to the lack of expense items incurred in the second quarter in conjunction with the closing of the wealth management joint venture, as well as continued expense disciplines. The PBT margin was 19%. Profit before tax was $668 million, another quarter of record profitability.","Total client assets were up versus the second quarter at $1.8 trillion. Global fee-based asset inflows were $15 billion. Fee-based assets under management increased to $652 billion at quarter end. Global representatives were 16,517 higher than the second quarter. Bank deposits were $130 billion up versus the second quarter. Approximately $94 billion were held in Morgan Stanly banks. The third quarter was the first in which we did not have a drag from NCI from wealth management, because we now own 100% of the business.","Investment management revenues of $828 million were up 23% versus the second quarter. In traditional asset management, revenues of $369 million were down from the second quarter driven by lower performance fees and asset management and administration fees. In real estate investing and merchant banking, our revenues were up meaningfully reflecting strong investment performance, favorable market conditions and catch up of carried interest in two funds as we surpassed our hurdle rates.","Expenses were $528 million, up 3% from the second quarter driven by higher compensation associated with higher revenues. Profit before tax was $300 million, up 88% sequentially. NCI was $64 million versus $21 million last quarter. Total assets under management increased to $360 billion driven by market appreciations.","Turning to our outlook. The impasse in Washington over the last several weeks was an unfortunate tax on the economy. Assuming constructive steps are now taken, we expect the U.S. growth as well as broader market activity to resume the pace that was on prior to the events of the last several weeks. Although our M&A pipeline has steadily grown over the course of 2013 and increase in transaction volume off of the recent lows hinders on CEO confidence about the economic outlook. Clearly regarding a long-term resolution as distinct from a short-term fix is likely needed before there was meaningful pickup in new activities. However, M&A revenues for the fourth quarter should not be affected to any notable extent by the recent impasse in the upcoming decision dates, because revenues are associated with deals that have already been announced and are well on the path to closings. Underwriting activity, particularly on the equity side, remained strong. Institutional trading activity started off the quarter relatively subdued, but may accelerate on the back of the recent temporary resolutions. Retail investors have been similarly cautious though they have not pulled away from the markets.","I will conclude by saying our results evidenced a stable and diverse business mix. The model weathered a slowing trading environment well but of far greater importance is one that is poised for greater upside with normal fees. With our high margin predictable wealth management business such a significant percent of our portfolio, we have a significant shock absorber in weaker markets. In addition, we expect that our earnings will be even more predictable with the ongoing execution of our bank strategy. Morgan Stanley is well positioned from a resource perspective from a return to somewhat normal market. Our bar is at the lowest levels in the earth and we are prepared to take risk on behalf of our clients when demand resumes. Liquidity is high and we have a strong and high quality capital base. Thank you for joining us. And James and I will now take your questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And the first question will come from Glenn Schorr with ISI.","","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Hi, thanks. So I heard your comments loud and clear on fixed income in the quarter, I just want to make sure that the RWA shrinkage is on track at the same pace that you had laid out for us and that there is no necessary mindset change in offshore [ph] and still think that you can put up in the, I don\u2019t know, $1.5 billion to $2 billion a quarter range in normalcy?","\u00a0","Ruth Porat","So our orderly reduction program [ph] is very much on track, has not changed that. The only thing that I did discuss at a conference in September is to provide greater clarity about our consistent perhaps to reduce [indiscernible] within fixed income. We are breaking out lending from the RWA total so we\u2019re presenting just RWAs for fixed income so in the second quarter when I said we had 239 billion of RWAs in fixed income if you exclude the lending related RWAs that number is 219 billion. This quarter we are down to 213 billion and we've similarly reset our end state it was 200 billion it's now sub 180 billion. So very much on the same path, no change there and then as it relates to how we're looking at managing the business overall we\u2019ve a very keen lends on driving to and ROEs that is greater than our cost to capital. We think that the reduction and risk weighted assets is a core part of that, expense management is core part of that and that is a key driver. We\u2019re looking at revenues, expenses capital optimization but the key lens is really on in ROE and excess of our cost to capital.","","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Fair enough. On that front just I noticed first is the Basel III ratio that you gave at 10.8 is that standardized versus advanced and curious on how we got 90 basis point growth in the quarter I mean earnings were okay but risk weighted assets were down 2.8% it's a big jump, was just curious how they got there.","","Ruth Porat","That's on advanced, it's fully loaded and it is driven by two things, one, earnings accretion and then the associated reduction in numerator deducts under Basel III and the reduction in risk weighted assets. So both numerator benefits and denominator benefits.","","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Not something we should be looking for every quarter, right? I mean it's a big, big move.","","Ruth Porat","I'm not going to, I will let you do the forecast they were continuing to drive earnings and was continuing to reduce the risk weighted assets.","","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay last one you were also on the long-term lending commitment page 12, there is a wealth management loans and lending lines that's been growing sub-45% year-on-year it's up 7% in the quarter. Is that in any way a leading indicator for deposit deployment or am I mixing apples and oranges there?","","Glenn Schorr - ISI","No you are very much focused on where we\u2019re focused strategically one of the big benefits of the acquisition is onboarding of the deposits. The rate of onboarding this quarter this past quarter, the third quarter was unusually high. We had a big slug come over immediately upon shortly after closing the acquisition and on a go forward basis we will have 1.75 billion in that area, 1.75 billion coming over on a monthly basis. So we had a bigger on boarding this quarter but the focus really is deployment of those deposits to support loan growth both in wealth management and on the institutional security side and as we've talked about in wealth management the real opportunity is we\u2019re underpenetrated versus our peers. Now we\u2019ve got about 5% penetration, our peers have about 10% and we see very attractive growth opportunities both with PLA product that's security based lending as well as residential mortgages and so that's what you're seeing and that's what we've been building towards since 2009 when we created the joint venture and we\u2019re executing on that.","","Glenn Schorr - ISI","I just want to know are those commitments, is that securities based lending because my gut is it's a tough environment while refi is dropping by 50% in the quarter, is that securities based lending? What am I looking at to see that kind of growth in commitments? Because something good is happening.","","Ruth Porat","So PLAQUE, the securities based lending PLA you are seeing strong growth in it, residential mortgage is where you have commitments and that we've had a strong pipeline of demand there so even with the slowing environment we have more demand than we\u2019re executing against but the bigger growth is in PLA.","","Operator","The next question will come from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","","Howard Chen - Credit Suisse","Just a follow-up on slower quarter for everyone we can see that you de-risk. I was just hoping you can discuss where returns are in the major fixed businesses today. So we can just track progress over time as the environment improves and you do evolve of what you want to do on capital and expenses?","","Ruth Porat","So the \u2013 was that \u2013 it was lower volumes industry wide, I would note that and I said this in my comments given the tightening in our credit spreads, we did also have a meaningful negative swing in CVA sequentially. If you exclude CVA in both quarters, our FICC results were actually down single-digit percentages, but going through the products as you asked, rates was challenging, risk remained low. We continue to run with the historically low levels there. It tapers down in May as you may recall I talked about that last quarter. So we would look to see some upside in that business longer term if markets normalize. Foreign exchange was down quarter-over-quarter. That was volumes and mix. Electronic is better, but voice is lower and that\u2019s the higher margin. So that was bit of a drag. On credit \u2013 on the credit side as I noted, it was a bright spot. We were actually up quarter-over-quarter. We had good performance across IT distressed and high yields and was balanced across geographies. That\u2019s been a consistent strong area for Morgan Stanley. Mortgages was also quieter and commodities was up a bit modestly, but still running at lower levels. So overall, I mean, the net of it you can see in the results was slower, quieter, quarter. Our risk was down, we are always down in those areas and we would expect to see some upside as markets normalize.","","Howard Chen - Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks Ruth. And switching over to supplemental leverage ratio, can you discuss what the change in centralized clearing assumptions did to the model and is it simply earnings generation during the quarter that made up to that delta for that model change and with the positive inflows you mentioned or is there something else that\u2019s going on?","","Ruth Porat","So in terms of clearing in the second quarter, I think the general industry lead was clearing would benefit the denominator. And obviously in the second quarter, the rules have just come out prior to various earnings calls and we have now had time to assess clarify certain items. There were changes in both the numerator and the denominator. And in particular with respect to central clearing the rules clarified clearing unto itself doesn\u2019t \u2013 isn\u2019t a deduct, it does facilitate compression trades and we are still very focused on back loading. And we have seen an acceleration in interest in compression trades by banks both in the U.S. and in Europe, because it\u2019s one of the few tools to reduce exposures. The other thing that changed quarter-over-quarter is the on-boarding of deposits that I mentioned, we on-boarded $21 billion of deposits. So just those two were \u2013 was about a 30 basis point reduction and the offset to that really was in the numerator between earnings and some of the numerator deducts was the offset.","","Howard Chen - Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks. And then you have been speaking to higher litigation expenses over the past few quarters, James, you have talked about it more broadly to the investment community, I was just hoping you could take a step back and just give us a sense of what inning you believe Morgan Stanley is in working through just crisis related litigation issues?","","James Gorman","Well, that\u2019s an interesting question, Howard. I think we have obviously fully disclosed all of the litigation risks that we have out there and we are working our way through it. I can\u2019t really tell you what inning we have been taking elevated expenses for a couple of quarters, I am sure there will be \u2013 some of that will continue, but we are managing our way through. We have I guess the good fortune to be one of the smaller dogs in this price, and as an institution and we obviously have less of the traditional mortgage exposure. So in some areas, we are just not participants happily, but in the traditional \u2013 in some of the litigation we are.","","Howard Chen - Credit Suisse","Okay thanks. And maybe just a last follow-up to that one, Ruth, how would you sort of size the incremental litigation expenses this quarter and could you also just give us the size on the gain on sale of Hub as well? Thanks.","","Ruth Porat","So litigation has been running about $200 million to $300 million higher per quarter than one would assume in the end state and state the obvious it\u2019s lumpy, it\u2019s unpredictable, but we got to tell you more it\u2019s on the same set of issues associated with pre-crisis matters and so it should come down when these issues are behind the industry, but it\u2019s been about $200 million to $300 million. And then with respect to the sale \u2013 the gain on sale, it\u2019s part of the overall investments line. There are number of items in that. And I think on a go-forward basis, if you look at prior quarter, prior year that\u2019s probably more reflective of future run rates.","","Howard Chen - Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks.","","Operator","Next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","I just wanted to clarify a little bit the comments that Ruth made about the receipt but not really deployment of the deposits. I mean there must have been some impact on net interest income for GWM and maybe more broadly for the corporation from the receipt of those deposits or is that not fair?","","Ruth Porat","I know that ain\u2019t fair. What I was trying to say is that with the on-boarding of deposits we did have a big portion come over in this quarter, a lot still in cash and we\u2019re deploying it into AFS and loan growth and so you do see this quarter some of the upside in net interest income and wealth management is due to growth in our lending balances. The other benefit you see in NII is associated with the acquisition part of the acquisition we eliminated outstanding preferred with Citi and the expenses associated with it. So two drivers of net interest income but you're absolutely right, there is upside this quarter in that and we expect to continue to see more upside as we\u2019re deploying out of cash into AFS and loan growth.","","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","And then you gave a you told us that your quotes are one of 10.8 under Basel III was under the advanced basis. Can you tell us what the calculation is on standardized basis?","","Ruth Porat","So on a standardized basis RWAs are a bit higher it's obviously the second test we establish a minimum and if we\u2019re running greater than the required we\u2019re not required to report it but we are above that minimum.","","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","So you're saying the RWAs are higher and so the standardized ratio would be lower?","","Ruth Porat","Yeah. The standardized ratio will be lower; I guess that's most relevant actually under CCAR moving to standardized for 2015 but of course requirements under CCAR for standardized is 4.5%.","","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Right. Goldman gave some comments on their investment banking backlog and said that it was actually the best it's been in five years. Can you give us a sense for your comments sounded a little bit more cautious in that regard but can you give us a sense for the direction of your backlog relative to last quarter?","","Ruth Porat","The backlog is up, it's actually it's high been in years. My comment with respect to in particular M&A is the backlog in M&A has been growing nicely throughout the year consistently but the main factor really is while we have talked about on many other quarters which is M&A is proxy of CEO confidence and given the impacts in the last couple of weeks and the fact that we don\u2019t have a final deal in DC but it's kind of an interim step here. I just had a caveat that until there is confidence about the economic outlook I wouldn't want to suggest that that growing pipeline actually goes through to announce and closed.","It's frustrating because all signs had been that DC was improving and confidence was up and the pipeline was building accordingly and hopefully we get a resolution and we actually see that work its way through. The equity pipeline is also very strong, the highest it's been in years and I think that we would expect to see more activity that moving through the pipeline. The fourth quarter tends to be seasonally better than the third quarter given July blackouts and August and it's a very strong high-quality pipeline.","","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","And then the final question is on FICC, you have someone else had asked identified in the past a minimum target revenue of 6 billion and I think the implication has been that in order to exceed your cost of capital you need to generate that kind of revenue levels year-to-date on a cleaned up ex-DVA basis. You have done about 3.5, so let's say that you're cracking for 4.5ish this year. That\u2019s still well below the 6 billion, do you remain as confident as you might have been a couple of quarters ago that the $6 billion is a realistically achievable level and if not have you, are you making any incremental changes to your resource deployments?","","Ruth Porat","We remain very focused and confident about the path to a higher ROE in fixed income and as I said there are three major levels, revenues which is a function of the operating environment among other things. And so we will put that to the side expenses and capital. And we are looking at all three levers, but the main thing is controlling that which we control to drive ROEs greater than the cost of capital within fixed income. And so between expense management, some of the things that we have been doing there continue to do and capital optimization we have a flight path to an ROE in excess of cost of capital. And that\u2019s the real value. If there is one metric to stay focused on, it\u2019s ROE. That\u2019s the way we are managing the business.","","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Got it. So it sounds like you feel that you might be able to achieve that cost of \u2013 that, that return ahead of the cost of equity without necessarily achieving $6 billion in revenue given the expense and other capital levers that you can use. Is that fair?","","Ruth Porat","Yes.","","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research","Okay, great. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you so much.","","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","","Operator","Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on your comment James that you are just beginning to see the benefits from acquisition of the 100% of the joint venture. I mean your branches are already down your profit margin is up some to have the deposits aside from additional loan penetration to your customers, what other benefits are still to be achieved?","","Ruth Porat","So I will start on that. There are quite a number if you just go through the items that we talked about that are the contractual benefit as a result of the acquisition that will probably give you a sense of why we believe we are just beginning to see it. So one is the order flow agreement that we terminated that upon completion of the acquisition and so order flow previously went down over JV partner stays at Morgan Stanley, that\u2019s in the principle trading line. However, given industry volumes were lower in the third quarter just with the overall markets having seasonality, we had a more modest benefit lower than we would expect on a quarterly basis and then a more normal environment still upside there.","Net interest income I already commented on, but with continued loan deployment, that\u2019s a very important area additional upside, in particular, given the margin on that \u2013 on loan products we see real upside in NIM. There are couple of other ins and outs to deposit referrals in the FDIC fees smaller and then obviously the elimination of NCI, which is below the line, but does benefit earnings. And so again a more normalized environment continuing to build out the loan book the upside from that lending product are dropping to the bottom lines.","","James Gorman","And I think, Mike, I would add a couple of additional thoughts. One is if you look at where the industry, the wealth management industry now is it\u2019s very concentrated. And during the period of turmoil of the crisis, post-crisis and then our acquisition of Smith Barney and various staggered pieces that we hurdle on the way, there was a lot of attrition, a lot of moving people between different firms. And that is the tax on the industry obviously and it\u2019s inconvenient for clients in many cases, but that level of turnover has dropped significantly and we expect it to continue to drop. So that reduces your overall compensation costs, because obviously recruiting deals can be very expensive, number one. Number two, the strength of the old Smith Barney business at its core was its managed money program and the strength of the Morgan Stanley business at its core was its capital markets capability, which is based upon Westchester. And we are continuing to see each of those strengths sort of populate the other side of the house. So it\u2019s now become together as one firm. And that\u2019s why you are seeing so much growth in the managed money side and you are seeing very good retail distribution of institutional underwriting. So I think just fundamentally it\u2019s a more robust business and the broader industry structure is more accommodating to better performance over time.","","Mike Mayo - CLSA","As far as the outlook for the number of reps, the number of offices, how much you are looking to organically grow the business from here and also how long will it take to deploy the new $20 billion of deposits again?","","Ruth Porat","So in terms of FA headcount, it was up this quarter for a couple of reasons. One, attrition has been running at low levels for some time. It was even lower this quarter and then we had a higher number of trainees with the probably the training program and the time of the year. You could see that number going up a bit. Really, we are not managing it to a number. It\u2019s we are still focused very much on as a productivity and we just had a larger training program, strong for your needs [ph] we\u2019re just starting. So kind of in and around that level. In terms of branches you saw the number of branches come down this quarter, the way we look at that it it's a function of really market by market analysis, [indiscernible] the question is do you have completely fully staffed offices within any market, strong culture, no more room in this space. No need to consolidate or should you consolidate so at this point the big reductions that we've seen are really behind us now it's just market by market analysis and then in terms of the deployment of the deposits to support loan growth, you're really going to see that the deposits deployment go not just into wealth management products but also institutional products and of course the AFS portfolio and as we consistently have said we\u2019re very much leading with risk management credit risk management. So there is nice growth near-term and we've been building that infrastructure as I've said since we created the joint venture back in 2009 but we\u2019re leading with risk management, we're not, just going to keep using the term prudent study pace and you will continue to see it deployed over the next continued study phase.","","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Then last follow-up what specific loan products by category would it be a lot of mortgages or what else in addition to that?","","Ruth Porat","Well the main thing is really this PLA product, the securities based lending product which is a more flexible product for our clients really enables them to retain their securities portfolio, continued to be invested in the market that's the primary one. We\u2019re underpenetrated as I said, residential mortgage is next on the list, the next major category for our retail area and we continue to have strong demand because we\u2019re off of such a small base and again given the low levels of penetration. And then on the institutional security side its product very consistent with our strong areas within our franchise to James opening comment where we have strong client franchise, strong bankers that built the incremental infrastructure required. So for example in commercial real estate, in project finance areas consistent with the businesses we\u2019re already in where we are already serving clients, we're now just expanding the suite of products. So it's growth in both areas.","","Operator","The next question will come from Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","","Mike Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a follow up on the SLR, you mentioned some changes in that process. You guys have gone through the proposal, in terms of getting from 4% to 5% in 2015. Can you just give us an update on that glide path again in the past you said collapsing is in trade but anything that has changed based on further review of the proposal?","","Ruth Porat","Certainly so greater than 5% in 2015 we\u2019re very confident with the supply path there because there are opportunities with both the numerator and denominator and very consistent with the strategy against which we\u2019re then executing. So we\u2019re not assuming any benefits from potential changes in the rules and starting with the denominator where we see the biggest opportunity, the first is with our focus on reducing risk-weighted assets and fixed income that leads to a reduction in the balance sheet, a reduction in the grossed up balance sheet of this relationship between RWAs and grossed up balance sheet. So that's number one, its very much on strategy. The second is derivatives growth as I said can be reduced through compression trade; we've been focused on that for some time. We had not previous as of the second quarter hadn\u2019t quantified it and viewed it as an additional upside opportunity. All that we've done in central clearing, our focus in particular on back loading helps facilitate the pace of compression trades and just in the SLR was announced and the BIS proposal was announced, we have seen an interesting in compression we think both in U.S. and in Europe and the total compression opportunity is greater than what we had assumed from clearing. So that is very much in the plan. There is also numerator benefits from capital accretion and some of the numerator mitigation so that the combined gets us to a strong glide path to greater than 5% in 2015 and also important to know it includes the assumption that we would have spiteful capital returns to shareholders.","","Mike Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just on the asset management business it seems like each quarter it comes in stronger than expected. I guess just two questions on that on the traditional side it seems like it was a little weaker you mentioned performance fees to just trying to figure out how much that impacted it? And then when I think about the real estate and merchant banking, just longer term you just want to try to gauge how much of that business you guys can still do meaning its funds managed by others versus anything that you might have to shrink over time. Just want to get an update on that?","","Ruth Porat","Sure. So on the traditional asset management side, you identified that it\u2019s \u2013 it was down due to higher performance fees in the second quarter. And then we had higher waivers on liquidity funds this quarter. And then on real estate and merchant banking as I said the upside was gains there. We recently broke through hurdle rates on two funds. So we had catch up on carry for those two funds. We are now close to the end of the catch up for those two funds. We are earning carry on several other funds, but good performance and had attractive catch up on carry. And then in terms of looking forward and those funds we have strong teams in place. We are pleased with the returns there. And it\u2019s clearly a function of how much capital you have in those businesses.","","James Gorman","Yes, I don\u2019t think there is any constraint or in fact I think the business is in some ways more attractive, because increasingly it\u2019s fee-based businesses, because you have less capital at risk, where we are in private equity, we are in mezzanine finance, we are in real estate, we are in infrastructure funding, we have a pretty broad-based merchant bank. And a number of those groups are in fundraising right now. And I think its good teams as Ruth said, good performance, limited capital and it\u2019s a nice business model.","","Mike Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks a lot.","","Ruth Porat","Thank you.","","Operator","Next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Good morning.","","James Gorman","Good morning.","","Brennan Hawken - UBS","So just to follow up there real quick on Mike\u2019s question, is it possible to quantify the carry in the catch up that you guys had this quarter just so we can understand how much is recurring and how much was sort of more one-time?","","Ruth Porat","No, we don\u2019t break that. I can leave that to you.","","Brennan Hawken - UBS","That\u2019s alright, okay. I figured I\u2019d give it a shot. And then on asset management just to sort of verify because I think there was a little bit of confusion before to be open on this, would you guys had a bump in your investments line in the investment management division, but that really \u2013 it\u2019s my understanding that primarily washes out in NCI for that segment, is that right?","","Ruth Porat","No, within investment management, we had carry catch up as we indicated, because we broke through the hurdle rate on a couple of funds. And so a majority of that actually is retained at Morgan Stanley and NCI can see as well, there is still NCI associated with the funds, but now we retain a large portion of that in-house.","","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. So that was the primary source of the carry and then we have got to just basically come up with our own assumptions about how much is catch up and how much is repeatable?","","Ruth Porat","Correct.","","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. And then you gave some great color on the strength in the equities business of remarkably strong quarter really especially looking at the U.S. counterparts, they have reported here to-date. And it didn\u2019t sound like, there were any kind of one-time components or things that wouldn\u2019t repeat, but just kind of just want to verify, is there anything that we should think about as one-time in nature in that number?","","Ruth Porat","No, we have consistent \u2013 I feel like quarter-after-quarter we talk about the strength in our Institutional Equities business. There was another strong quarter across products and geographies and I have said that a number of quarters in a row here balanced across the franchise. DV balances were very resilient and that was notable given summer seasonality. And cash equities, the market data indicates that we outperformed with industry volumes down, so a strong quarter. Typically, the fourth quarter is lower in part with PB balances lower as managers go into year-end, but nothing to note other than consistent strong performance by the Institutional Equities business.","","James Gorman","One of the things that has been a determined move by the equities management is to provide a much more integrated approach across cash derivatives prime brokerage to our clients. And I think that help me as gain market share and obviously helps with the stability of the revenues.","","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Terrific. Thanks. And then last one for me just on the buybacks, is this the right pace we should assume or should we assume some pick up here in 4Q and the buyback is approved through the first quarter too, so we should carry that through that right, just want to verify my understanding there?","","Ruth Porat","Yes. The approval process for CCAR through the end of the first quarter of 2014. So you should assume that we will use it no later than the end of the first quarter of 2014.","","Brennan Hawken - UBS","And is it okay; is it right for us to assume that there is a space for a pickup in the phase?","","Ruth Porat","Well the map would just that given what we've used so far.","","Operator","The next question will come from with Fiona Swaffield with RBC.","","Fiona Swaffield - RBC","I just have a couple of follow-up questions on [indiscernible] and deductions. Firstly on the deductions they seem to have fallen quite significantly on 1.5 billion sequentially, could you explain what\u2019s driving that, what kind of things whether its into institute GTA [PH] or private equity funds I'm not sure and then the secondary is on the Basel III RWAs, they have gone down outside of fixed income I think for the first time, I remember it. Are you doing something particularly outside fixed income as well on the Basel III efficiency basis? Thanks.","","Ruth Porat","So in terms of Basel III RWAs the main focus really is in the fixed income as you know as you said I think it just consistent with overall wider market low volumes the backdrop that we have been talking about. In terms of the Tier 1 common and numerator and deductions there obviously the buckets and waterfall of numerator deductions based on Tier 1 common levels and so again as we create capital there are reduced deductions, numerator deductions kind of the waterfall.","","Operator","The next question will come from Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson.","","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson","Just two clarifying questions, one back to the SLR glide path, does the continued on-boarding of deposits is that done sort of ratably over the period of time in terms of their contemplation in SLR or is the endpoint somehow fully loaded in the current figure?","","Ruth Porat","So there are two parts to that question, the on-boarding of deposits was very large in the third quarter due the, that was contractual nature of the acquisition, one large tranche came on as I said a couple of weeks after closing and then the balance of fit is about 1.75 billion per month through the middle of 2015. So the big increase that we saw this quarter you\u2019re not going to see on a go forward basis that\u2019s the terms of the contract 1.75 per month through mid-2015 and yes that is fully loaded into the estimate of greater than 5% in 2015.","","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson","Got it, it's just that the influence of the incremental is just not so significant over the-","","Ruth Porat","Exactly and as you have deployment you have greater earnings though you\u2019ve a couple of variables going on as well.","","Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson","Got it and then just returning to FICC, it sounds like the most significant comment you made is that adjusting for some of the items that your results quarter-on-quarter would have been down actually relatively little and so I'm just trying to reconcile that with the and of course it looked like there was a little bit of share gain in credits from some of your commentary. And so I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that with the continued reduction in RWAs to understand how it is that there is this group of assets that seem to have so little profitability associated with it.","","Ruth Porat","That's precisely the problem they have so little profitability, associated with them currently and on a go forward basis. So the RWAs that we identified that we\u2019re reducing structure credit, long dated uncollateralized derivatives are drag on the overall returns in the business and through passive and active mitigation we are pleased to be shutting them at the fastest pace that we can. You've seen that we are materially ahead of anything that we laid out you know we were 390 billion on the old [ph] basis, RWA is back in the third quarter of '11 it's been a lot of heavy lifting and we are getting near to the -- there is light at the end of the tunnel given the pace of execution and with business leaders having the analytics, dashboards to know how to reduce risk weighted assets that\u2019s helped the pace. So we are pleased to be exiting them and it does help on the overall returns because it not only helps free-up capital from fixed income but I think that it's providing us with more consistent quality earnings base within fixed income which is one of the key elements as we\u2019re thinking about how to resize any kind of capital return on a go forward basis.","","Operator","The next question will come from Roger Freeman with Barclays Capital.","","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital","Hi, good morning. Just on the \u2013 back on the share repurchases, you think you commented I think earlier, greater share repurchases to hit the greater than 5% target. And obviously also as part of the ROE expansion, does that \u2013 that doesn\u2019t assume anything sort of beyond the pace that you have been approved for, is that right?","","Ruth Porat","I mean the answer what I think your question was and then let you have a follow-up if I missed it.","","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital","Okay.","","Ruth Porat","So I was answering one question regarding the very small share repurchase program we approved to do this year that ends through March, we enter the end of the first quarter. And as we look forward given all that we have done to build capital given the greater consistency of results, the accretion of capital, we are building in our view increased flexibility to return more capital on a go-forward basis. We are not going to judge CCAR or timing cadence, but it does build greater flexibility on a go-forward basis and that\u2019s what I was trying to convey. I am not sure if I hit your questions.","","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital","Yes, mostly. I guess the point being that greater share repurchases is part of the active hitting 5% and that\u2019s 2015 target, that\u2019s kind of implies that you would expect to do higher than the small repurchase next year as that gives you a year?","","Ruth Porat","We have certainly built in that in providing this guidance of higher than 5%, but until we see the CCAR number, we have the capacity to do it.","","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital","Got it.","","Ruth Porat","As what the greater than 5% means and my caveat, we haven\u2019t seen the CCAR rolls, the shocks. So we are not going to prejudge CCAR as that I am not going to say what it will be next year, but we certainly have the capacity with the glide path to greater than 5% with much higher share repurchase even included in that number.","","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital","Okay. And then I just wanted to maybe get any updated thoughts you have on the physical commodities business obviously, we don\u2019t have final walker yet, but there has been a lot of obviously discussion in the industry and others have gotten out, this is where -- how do you think this stands for you strategically?","","Ruth Porat","Well, I don\u2019t think there is much change from what we commented on previously. It\u2019s been a good business for us for many years. We want to be smart about what we do to drive returns in the business for the firm overall and so really no update at this point.","","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital","Okay. And just a small one on the \u2013 back on the carry, I know you are not quantifying the size, but what percentage of the way \u2013 the carry catch up, is this typical 80-20 in catch up?","","Ruth Porat","Yes, probably I think a bit more than that. So basically\u2026","","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital","Right, 75% and 80% away there?","","Ruth Porat","No, so we have done a carry catch up this quarter and we are almost through it. And so again it\u2019s going to be a function of the market in the economy.","","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital","Okay. So there is a little bit to go. Okay.","","Ruth Porat","Right.","","Roger Freeman - Barclays Capital","Alright, okay, thanks.","","Operator","The next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Hey, good morning. One quick follow-up on the SLRs, are compression trades and OTC clearing, are they in your guidance? I thought it was excluding that, it was just sort of the run-off would get you to 5% or did I misunderstand that?","","Ruth Porat","So in the second quarter as I said, the general industry read was that clearing would benefit the denominator. Since then its clarified clearing unto itself does not, so take that out. When you take that out and you add the deposit growth that\u2019s the 30 basis point deduct that I mentioned previously. However, what we have separately \u2013 we have the time now to do is go through and quantify the benefit from compression trades. So compression trades is distinct from clearing, reduce the denominator and it\u2019s really the pace of activity with compression trades volume that we are targeting with compression trades is what helps is one component of what drives the leverage ratio higher. The fact that we have been focused on central clearing for some time and that we have been focused on back loading facilitates the pace of compression but put those two as distinct issues and it\u2019s not the clearing itself, but just compressions.","","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Fair enough, the compression in your guidance of that.","","Ruth Porat","Yes. Compression is in the guidance.","","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Okay, thanks. And then on the cost saves, can you give us some sense in where you are, you targeting $1.6 billion net by the end of next year? Where do you stand at this point?","","Ruth Porat","So we are very much on track for the expense reduction goals. When we set out the goal, as you may recall, of $1.6 billion reduction, it's at the end of 2012 and said by the end of 2014 we would be down by 1.6 billion but we're also very careful to say that that was predicated on revenues flat to 2012 and indicated that it was higher revenues which we expected certain expenses would go up in particular those that are activity-based but that we would measure progress based on overall expense ratios, we\u2019re trying to hold for it number of different components and when you look at the components of non-composition expense year-to-date, activity related costs like brokerage and clearing and transaction taxes are up while non-activity related costs like occupancy and market data are down and so when you kind of go through the map take 2012 revenues, deducts that our expense ratio back then was I think it was 84%. If you deduct the 1.6 billion expense savings, we said we would get that takes your expense ratio down to 79%. We now have revenues up from activity related costs up but net-net we\u2019re at that level and if you exclude elevated litigation expense we're ahead and our view is that litigation expense will be a cost for the industry for the near-term but we\u2019re improving our fundamental cost base and we will get through that at some point. So very much on-track for the expense program ex-litigation.","","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Right I mean I understand what you're saying you had targeted ratios but revenues are up where do you think they should be current revenues or I guess another way to say if you think your 50% of the way through it 25% or 75%. I mean obviously you must have some kind of thoughts on absolute headcount or something like that?","","Ruth Porat","Just on the numbers given we are already at the 79% expense ratio that was implied back in 2012. One way to answer I would say that we\u2019re excluding litigation that we\u2019re, that we have achieved but we\u2019re only partially way through executing it and so we have the balance of next year fourth quarter balance of next year to continue to execute on programs that we've laid out and for that reason we say that and I would say that we\u2019re there but we're continuing to execute on the programs that we identified back at the end of 2012. So we\u2019re feeling very good about our ability to continue to reduce expense rate.","","James Gorman","I will just add that there is a culture of expense management across the firm but we haven't seen for long time whenever I travel around the world local offices, sub-business groups everybody understands the program; everybody understands what we\u2019re doing. We have a very well-coordinated program with 40 or 50 executives as part of it. So this is going to be continuous process. As Ruth said on the percentage basis I mean we\u2019re already at the 79% but that's honestly that's not our focus, our focus is continue to make the firm more efficient by bringing in together as one firm which we did taking three platforms to one in wealth management, operating wealth management closer to institutional securities, lot of the electronic development within institutional securities. So there have been a lot of things that are going to be ongoing for next several years and I think we will continue to add.","","Ruth Porat","So we completed three of eight quarters and achieved the target in the end state and we\u2019re continuing to work.","","Operator","The final question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","You guys provided a lot of details on fixed RWAs but if you talked about the total assets in that business?","","Ruth Porat","We have not broken that up, no.","","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","I guess if I can take a stab at trying to get to the opportunity of reducing those assets if we think about RWAs coming down by 30 billion to 40 billion obviously there is a multiplier effect for the overall firm. I will thing it's more for FICC. It seems like it might be in the 100 billion to 150 billion range in terms of total assets within FICC that might come down?","","Ruth Porat","I'm going to go through the map on the call if there is some technical you want to follow up with IR, you can do that.","","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay but it should be a multiple of RWAs I would think, right?","","Ruth Porat","So we're looking at the RWA reduction, we're looking at grossed up balance sheet and we\u2019re managing all of our businesses through a risk based capital lends, leverage based capital lends, increase doing an SLR lend. So again while we\u2019re driving is the strongest return in that business so balance sheet is coming down as we -- and grossed up balance sheet is coming down even more as we reduce risk weighted assets.","","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay and then just separately as we think about the remaining 35 billion or so deposits coming in some of the benefits that you still get from what just came on, how should we think about the blended yields you deploy that into. Obviously, this could be a mix of retail loans, corporate loans and some securities, but what\u2019s maybe a good blended yield to think about?","","Ruth Porat","In a recent presentation, James actually laid out the return on cash, AFS, lending product and so we are continuing to deploy the cash into AFS and then between both the wealth management and institutional book and so let you build out the growth there. The components are in the presentation.","","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay, thank you very much.","","Celeste Brown","Thank you so much for joining our third quarter call.

","Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.

These adjusted operating performance metrics will be utilized throughout the remainder of this presentation in order to assess our strategic objective established in 2016. ","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James Gorman","Good morning, everybody. Thank you, Sharon. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. I'm going to take you through a summary of last year's performance as well as our outlook and plan for 2018. Following my remarks, Jon will take you through the quarter in detail. And after that, we will both take your questions. If we could start by turning to Slide 4 in the deck. At this point in our strategic evolution, it's worth putting our future goals in the context of what has taken place over the last several years. As illustrated in this slide, our primary focus in the early years was to put the troubles of the financial crisis behind us and to complete the full integration of the Wealth Management business. These steps were critical in order to reposition our firm to benefit from our world-class and complementary franchises. Then in early 2016, we outlined a 2-year strategic plan. The plan's primary goal was to achieve a 9% to 11% return on equity by the end of 2017. It also included a number of quantifiable secondary targets that we aim to achieve over the same time frame. Looking forward, with these targets achieved and a solid strategy in place, our management team will continue to work towards generating sustained high returns by investing for growth while maintaining fiscal vigilance and capital sufficiency. ","Slide 5. It outlines the key strategic objectives we aim to achieve by 2017. In each instance, our 2017 results are in line with or better than the target ranges. ","On Slide 6, we provide a more in-depth perspective, focusing on the financial backdrop that influence these results. As you all know, 2017 was a mixed year. While many financial markets produced strong returns and U.S. monetary policy continued to tighten gradually, benign markets impacted trading conditions. As we're all aware, much of 2017 was characterized by persistently low volatility across both rates and equities. This dearth of activity impacted our more market-dependent businesses. Despite these trading conditions, we were able to gain wallet share and capitalize on pockets of opportunity as they presented themselves. ","Our strategic plan for the past 2 years has focused on two equally important goals, increasing profitability and demonstrating stability of earnings. On Slide 7, we show the increase in profitability since 2015 both across earnings per share and ROE as well as return on tangible common equity. As many of you have requested, this is a metric we will highlight going forward. ","Turning to the next slide. We illustrate how our business mix has aided the improvement of earnings stability. Of course, this stability is the direct result of many changes, all aimed at building complementary franchises in securities, Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management. Importantly, a greater proportion of our earnings are now derived from more stable and higher-ROE businesses. This increased contribution from Wealth Management and Investment Management should help preserve profitability during periods of market disruption. ","Slide 9 shows as we look forward and outline areas for organic growth and further operational improvement. At the forefront of this plan is our strategy of deepening our lending footprint across our Wealth Management and Institutional Securities franchises. That will further add to the objectives of stability and consistency that I discussed earlier. We also see opportunities from continuing to press our advantage in our traditional areas of strength. Additionally, we will look for ways to realize the potential of our Investment Management platform, leveraging our attractive business mix, global client footprint and top-tier performing strategies. Our intention is to achieve these objectives while remaining fiscally vigilant and driving efficiency gains. When this disciplined execution is combined with attractive return profile, we feel confident we can deliver ongoing attractive returns. ","Slide 10 illustrates the steady growth of our lending footprint as well as the diversity of the overall lending mix. We continue to see demand for financing solutions and opportunities to deploy capital at attractive returns to support our clients' needs. This lending growth is supported by a high-quality deposit base, which is sourced predominantly from our existing Wealth Management client footprint. We look forward to discussing our lending and deposit strategies in greater detail during the year ahead. ","Turning now to Slide 11. Since the full acquisition of Smith Barney in 2013, we've focused on opportunities that come from being a premier wealth management provider at scale. We've witnessed material growth in our two main sources of annuitized revenues, fee-based assets and client liabilities, which produces, of course, net interest income. In both cases, we've made significant investments, enhancing our advisory platforms and banking and lending infrastructure, respectively. This has enabled us to take advantage of secular industry trends. At the same time, we continue to optimize our expense base while still investing in future growth initiatives, including our digital offering. Despite investments, noncompensation expenses are actually down from 5 years ago. The margin expansion demonstrates the business' undeniable scale benefits. ","Slide 12 shows the resulting impact to our revenue profile. Material revenue growth has been complemented by a change in revenue mix. Transactional activity, historically a more volatile source of revenues, has been significantly reduced and offset by growth in net interest income and fee-based revenue. As a result, average daily revenues have increased. Importantly, looking to the right of this slide, in 2017, 88% of days were above $60 million a day compared to 42% of that number in 2015. ","Slide 13 summarizes the future growth and margin opportunities in Wealth Management. Two years ago, we provided a 23% to 25% pretax margin target. This target was premised on an expectation that we would be able to grow both net interest and noninterest revenues while maintaining expense discipline. The objective was achieved, and it resulted in a full year 2017 margin of 25.5%. We continue to see upside to this margin. Over the next 2 years, we expect to achieve a 26% to 28% margin. Achieving this revised target will be dependent on executing on a number of revenue and expense initiatives that are outlined on the right-hand side of the page. Recall that we expect the margin to be positively impacted in excess of 100 basis points as the Smith Barney retention notes will be fully amortized by January of 2019, also at the same time we will continue to invest for growth. ","Turn to slide 14, which provides an overview of the progress made in Institutional Securities. The bar chart on the side shows the aggregate wallet of Morgan Stanley and our top 8 peers for each business, with the green circle illustrating our share of that wallet. As you can see, over the past 5 years, we have gained wallet share in each business line. As it relates to 2017, we witnessed solid results across all businesses. Investment Banking, it had its best year post crisis, driven by strong performance in all businesses, including our ECM franchise, which ranked #1 globally in a resurgent underwriting market. In Equity Sales & Trading, we maintained our #1 position for the fourth consecutive year, with a wallet share in excess of 20%, allowing us to maintain revenues of approximately $8 billion despite a smaller wallet. In Fixed Income Sales & Trading, we've gained share while resizing our business to one which is both critically and credibly sized and more appropriate for the wallet opportunity, and it generated more revenues than prior to the restructuring. ","Slide 15 outlines the progress we've seen in Fixed Income Sales & Trading franchise since the meaningful restructuring we undertook in 2015. Our target was to maintain our historical revenue footprint, but with reduced resources. As previously discussed, we met this goal in both 2016 and 2017, 2 years that saw very different market backdrops. These results are encouraging, particularly as we're able to navigate a more difficult 2017 and gain share despite a diminished industry wallet. Going forward, we aim to maintain a stable footprint in what we expect to be an improved industry wallet. ","Slide 16 outlines our Investment Management business. As I've noted before, Investment Management represents a high-returning business with opportunities for future growth. The approximate $482 billion of assets under management represents an attractive and complementary mix of alternative and traditional platforms. As illustrated, a meaningful portion of our revenues come from businesses such as alternatives, high-conviction equities and emerging markets. These are businesses where we believe we can deliver differentiated client value. As we've successfully undergone an organizational realignment and legacy cleanups over the past 2 years, we're now positioning the business for growth. 3 key drivers of growth will be investment performance, client partnerships and distribution and product innovations. ","Slide 17 provides examples of our ability to deliver on this growth potential. Our global distribution capabilities are notable. Approximately 2\/3 of our 2017 gross sales have come from outside the U.S. Strong positive net flows from these markets represent a differentiated contributor to assets under management growth. The examples outlined at the bottom of this slide illustrate that funds with differentiated strategies and strong investment performance tend to deliver significant AUM growth. We have identified a broad set of actionable organic growth opportunities within Investment Management. Moreover, as mentioned on our last call, we will continue to opportunistically evaluate M&A opportunities, such as Mesa West, where we can fill gaps or accelerate growth. ","Turning now to Slide 18. As a management team, we're focused on fiscal discipline. Optimizing our expense base has been a key driver of this approach as demonstrated by the multiple efficiency ratio targets we have set for ourselves over the years. For 2017, the success of our Project Streamline cost-savings initiative generated an efficiency ratio of 72.6%, a significant improvement relative to 2015, and indeed, inside our target of 74%. In 2018, we will adopt new accounting standards that Jon will touch on. While this change is PBT-neutral, there will be negative impact on the overall firm efficiency ratio. Looking through that lens, the efficiency ratio would have been approximately 73% in 2017, slightly up. Going forward, our goal is to continue to drive efficiencies across the businesses and maintain a ratio below the 73% level. ","Slide 19 outlines our historical capital return. In recent years, we've consistently increased our dividend and significantly grown our total payout to over $5 billion in 2017. Our non-objection from the 2017 CCAR submission allows us to return almost $7 billion in dividends and buybacks through 2Q 2018. The increase in capital return has been executed while we've concurrently invested for future growth and maintained adequate capital levels. Strong capital return is a critical element of our future success, and we believe we are more than sufficiently capitalized for our business mix, size and risk profile. We remain optimistic about regulatory refinements in the area of capital. However, it's too early to predict the magnitude of any changes, but we expect some relief while still maintaining extremely prudent capital and liquidity levels. ","Finally, let me touch on the impact of the U.S. corporate tax reform on Slide 20. Whereas the impact to the overall economic backdrop and activity levels within our business segments will only become clearer over time, we expect an immediate positive impact to our financial results in 2018. As a result of our significant U.S. earnings contribution, not least here, our Wealth Management segment, we expect to see a meaningful reduction in our effective corporate tax rate. These estimates are based on our current interpretation of the legislative changes. They may change as we receive additional guidance and as the interpretation of the Tax Act evolves over time. ","So Slide 21 summarizes our key strategic objectives over the course of the next two years, and they include, delivering a Wealth Management pretax margin of 26% to 28%; expanding our ISG penetration and leadership across the businesses; positioning Investment Management for growth; and finally, realizing a firm efficiency ratio of 73% or better. Together with an attractive capital return profile, the fulfillment of these targets will enable us to continue to drive ROE growth higher. Predicting ROE, of course, is difficult. That said, given our growth initiatives, maintaining expense discipline and recent changes to U.S. corporate tax law, we are increasing our target ROE range to 10% to 13% from 9% to 11% over the medium term. This new range underscores our belief that annually we should be able to consistently exceed our cost of capital across a variety of market backdrops. This management team is committed to executing on our strategy while looking for compelling growth opportunities in order to bring these objectives to fruition, which will provide both future profitability and performance. ","I'll now turn the call over to Jon, who will discuss the fourth quarter and annual results in more detail. Then together, we'd be delighted to take your questions. Thank you.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you, and good morning. In many respects, the fourth quarter's operating environment represented a continuation of the third quarter. In Sales & Trading, volatility across equity and fixed income markets remained depressed. Consequently, client activity was limited, affecting Fixed Income in particular. Corporate clients, however, remained active, driving strong results in Investment Banking. Investment Management momentum continued. And notably, Wealth Management posted new records. Firm revenues were $9.5 billion. In the quarter, PBT was $2.5 billion, EPS was $0.29 and ROE was 2.9%. Excluding aggregate discrete tax items of $1 billion, adjusted EPS was $0.84, and adjusted ROE was 8.6%.","For the fourth quarter, total noninterest expense was $7 billion, a 5% sequential increase, driven by higher compensation expense on higher revenues and seasonally higher marketing and business development and other expenses. Our full year efficiency ratio of 72.6% is below our 74% target we set 2 years ago. This marks the successful completion of Project Streamline, our initiative to reduce expenses by $1 billion relative to the 2015 levels. The target assumed flat revenues and incorporated a reduction across both compensation and noncompensation expenses. Project Streamline was broad-based, with over 200 separate initiatives across the entire firm. Some notable successes include, improving our workforce strategy by converting consultants and contingent workers into more cost-efficient FTEs and leveraging our U.S. and international centers of excellence; reducing professional services expenses by improved procurement processes and the implementation of technology-enabled solutions to reduce redundancies and reducing our technology-related expenses by consolidating 12 legacy data centers into 5. The adoption of private cloud and virtualization technology was an important component of the compression enabling us to achieve a smaller technology footprint. We have remained disciplined around compensation, achieving compensation ratios for Institutional Securities and Wealth Management below our targets of 37% and 56%, respectively. We have also seen a reduction in litigation expenses. The 460 basis point increase in our pretax margin achieved over the 2-year period provides the best illustration of the success of the project. Relative to 2015, ex DVA, full year 2017 revenue is up $3.4 billion or 10%, while noncompensation expenses are down 3%. This generated an increase in pretax profits of $2.5 billion or 32%. Looking ahead, our focus will be on ensuring that the savings achieved remain permanently out of the expense base. This will be key for us to maintain a firm efficiency ratio of 73% or below. ","Now to the businesses. Net revenues in our Institutional Securities business of $4.5 billion represents a 3% sequential increase. The slowdown in Fixed Income was offset by strength in Investment Banking. On a full year basis, net revenues of $18.8 billion were up 8%, representing our sixth consecutive year of growth ex DVA and a new postcrisis high. Noncompensation expenses were $1.7 billion for the quarter, driven by seasonally higher business development and other expenses. Compensation expenses were $1.6 billion, bringing our full year compensation to net revenue ratio to 35%, an approximate 200 basis point reduction compared to 2015. ","Investment Banking continued to show strength. Revenues of $1.4 billion were up 13% quarter-over-quarter. The increase was driven by underwriting, particularly in equity, which increased 52%. This was partially offset by a 6% reduction in advisory revenues. Looking at the full year, Investment Banking results benefited from the broad-based rebound in underwriting activity. Equity and Fixed Income underwriting were up 67% and 44%, respectively. Revenue growth across all regions and virtually all products contributed to these results. We continue to leverage our global footprint, working with clients to deliver holistic solutions. From a regional perspective, Asia showed a meaningful sequential increase, particularly in equity underwriting, demonstrating the value of our global franchise. We continue to expect Asian markets to play a key role in 2018. For the year, we were #1 globally in IPOs, equity and equity-linked offerings and #2 in announced and completed M&A. Full year revenues of $5.5 billion represent the second-highest in our history. Overall, our Investment Banking pipelines remain healthy and diversified across products, regions and sectors. Underwriting markets globally remain very receptive to a wide range of issuers with a variety of financing needs as credit spreads remain low, volatility muted and market liquidity deep. CEO confidence remains high, and we are actively engaged with our clients. Results, however, may be impacted by macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical events. Despite these uncertainties, we believe that the diversity of our franchise across both products and geographies will position us well for the year to come. ","In Sales & Trading, revenues were down 8% quarter-over-quarter. Muted markets characterized by continued low volatility and lack of idiosyncratic market-moving events impacted results. In equities, we retained our leadership position and are 1# globally for the fourth consecutive year. Our full year revenues were approximately $8 billion despite much of the year being impacted by historically low equity volatility. Year-over-year, we saw a growth in EMEA and Asia, offsetting a modest decline in the Americas. From a product perspective, derivative revenues were down on fewer large structured transactions in 2017, which was partially offset by higher cash revenues. ","Looking ahead to 2018, the implementation of MiFID II continues to be a focus area for many investors. We continue to see strong client demand for content, liquidity and financing solutions. Based on these early weeks, we have navigated MiFID as expected and have provided support to our clients through this complex process. ","Fixed Income revenues in the fourth quarter were $808 million, down 31% versus last quarter. The sequential decline was primarily driven by our macro businesses, which saw low client activity. Low volatility weighed on our rates and FX businesses. Credit results exhibited stability against a favorable backdrop for risk assets, and our lending businesses continued to be a source of stable revenues. In 2015, we made the decision to resize and reshape the business because we believed the size of the wallet would not change materially for the next several years. Since taking action, the wallet has been in a plus or minus $5 billion range from the $63 billion we saw in 2015. In 2017, we generated revenues of $4.9 billion despite a multiyear low for the industry wallet. Importantly, we believe there's operational leverage in the business should the wallet recover. ","Now moving to Wealth Management, which posted record quarterly revenues and PBT. Fourth quarter revenues were $4.4 billion, a 4% sequential increase contributing to a full year revenue growth of 10%. The PBT margin was 26.1% for the quarter and 25.5% for the full year, a year-over-year increase of more than 300 basis points. We continue to see the benefits of scale. Total annual expenses grew by only 5%, generating full year pretax profit growth of 25%. The expense leverage has enabled us to maintain a substantial level of investments into our future capabilities, including our digital, banking and advisory platforms, while at the same time increasing our margins. Total assets grew by 3% to $2.4 trillion in the fourth quarter. Total fee-based assets grew by 4%, now comprising 44% of total client assets. And fee-based asset flows of $21 billion capped a record year with total flows of $75 billion. Higher asset levels, combined with strong flows, contributed to asset management revenues of $2.5 billion, representing 3% growth relative to the third quarter. Net interest income of $1.1 billion is up 5% sequentially. The benefit from higher asset yields and lending balances was partially offset by higher funding costs as we diversify our deposit products. Full year NII growth of $576 million or 16% was driven by an increase in average loan balances of approximately $10 billion and higher rates. In 2018, we would expect NII growth to slow based on our anticipated funding mix and higher deposit betas than we experienced in 2017. ","Transactional revenues of $790 million increased 7% sequentially. On a full year basis, transactional revenues were stable, following a multiyear decline. Total noninterest expenses increased 5% sequentially, driven by higher comp on greater revenues and seasonally higher market and business development expenses. The full year compensation to net revenue ratio was 55.6%, in line with our target. This quarter's performance again demonstrates the strength and stability of our Wealth Management franchise. Investment Management witnessed another solid quarter with stable asset management fees and broad-based investment gains. Total net revenues were $637 million, down 6% quarter-over-quarter. The quarter included an impairment of an investment in a third-party manager reflected in other revenue. Full year revenues were $2.6 billion, a 22% increase versus the prior year. Our AUM of $482 billion in the fourth quarter grew 8% with positive net flows across all strategies, including strong seasonal flows in our liquidity business. As James discussed, we continue to see increased investor interest for strategies where we deliver differentiated value and strong investment performance. Net flows across our active strategies as well as private fund capital raising reached multiyear highs in 2017. Asset management fees of $572 million were up 1% sequentially. On a full year basis, asset management fees increased 6%, in line with the growth in our average AUM. Investment revenues were $112 million, down 2% relative to the last quarter. Full year investment revenues were $449 million, up considerably from last year, which included sales and markdowns on legacy LP investments and third-party-sponsored funds. As discussed in the past, this line item has potential to be lumpy. ","Turning to the balance sheet. On a sequential basis, total spot assets of $852 billion were essentially unchanged. Our pro forma fully phased-in standardized RWAs are also expected to remain stable at $379 billion. In addition, our pro forma fully phased-in Basel III standardized Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is expected to decrease to 16%, and our pro forma fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio is expected to decrease to 6.4%. The decline in both ratios is driven by the net discrete tax provision recorded in the quarter. ","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $1.25 billion of common stock or approximately 25 million shares, and our board declared a $0.25 dividend per share. Our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 71.5%. And for the full year, it was 39.7%. These rates include the approximate $1.2 billion net discrete tax provision due to the enactment of Corporate Tax Reform in the fourth quarter, primarily relating to the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower enacted tax rate. This was partially offset by other intermittent net discrete tax benefits unrelated to tax reform, which totaled $168 million in the fourth quarter and $233 million for the full year. Excluding these items, the adjusted tax rates were 31.4% for the fourth quarter and 30.8% for the full year. In 2018, we expect our tax rate to be reduced to 22% to 25% for the full year while exhibiting quarter-to-quarter volatility. Our first quarter tax rate is expected to be lower as the vast majority of conversions of employee share-based awards into firm shares will occur in this quarter. 2017 was a year of mixed environments for our businesses. As we look ahead to 2018, we are cautiously optimistic that the trading backdrop we saw in the fourth quarter will not persist. Further, there are a number of possible macro drivers that can positively impact the year ahead. Tax reform, in addition to the direct impact to our earnings, should provide the impetus for further engagement across corporate, institutional and retail clients. Continued monetary policy normalization will benefit our bank franchise and has the potential to lead to greater activity across Sales & Trading. We remain optimistic that regulatory refinement will reduce complexity and the administrative burden. ","With that, we will now open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","So I absolutely like the higher ROE targets. I'm curious if you could outline even just the highest level thoughts of assumptions behind them for both markets and rates. And then maybe more importantly, how much do you consider, like that of -- that, that is numerator growth, meaning returns? And how much does denominator shrink in terms of cap returns? Because you obviously have really high capital ratios.","Jonathan Pruzan","I think maybe I'll take the second half of the question first and then maybe James will add. In terms of numerator and denominator, as we said in the past, we think we're capital sufficient, and we'd like to continue to increase our capital return over the 2-year period that we talked about that. Our capital has actually grown by about $2 billion but, on average, our balance sheet has grown about $40 billion. So again, we believe that we're capital sufficient. And so therefore, the growth in ROE should be driven by the numerator and not the denominator. And in terms of the general capital return, as James mentioned, we haven't gotten the instructions for 2018. So I think it's a little early to predict how all of this sort of works into CCAR. In terms of operating environment, for the assumptions, we generally budget based on sort of a continuation of what we've seen in 2017 and also the forward curve. So generally, a positive macro backdrop and continuation of global growth that we've been seeing around the world.","James Gorman","Yes. Glenn, for a long time here, we've been asked on these calls, \"When are you going to get to 10% ROE?\" And I think the main takeaway here is that -- our view is we're not going to be below 10% ROE. So that's sort of number one, which is, frankly, a pretty important inflection point for this firm post crisis. We were obviously higher than that pre-crisis, but we also operated with leverage of 30, 40, 44x. We're operating with leverage of 11x. And we're confident in setting a target that says we'll be at 10% or greater. And we put a range out there for lots of reasons, including the ones you're alluding to. We don't know exactly where rates are going to be. We don't know exactly whether global GDP is going to be growing at 4%, 3.5%, 3%. We don't exactly the impact of the U.S. tax reform on corporate earnings. ","There are a lot of unknowns. But we're pretty confident, based upon our business mix, our presumed corporate tax rate, taking into account there's still a lot of questions around that, and where the global economic growth is that we will generate above 10%. Whether it will be 10%, 11%, 12% or 13%, that obviously will be driven by economic environment. If we get faster rate increase, that helps our deposits and rate trading business. If we get regulatory relief, which is not embedded in this, that helps the denominator. If we get continued global economic growth, synchronized growth at 3-plus percent, then clearly, we are, like our competitors, highly correlated to GDP growth. So all of those things, all of those things start to play in it.","Glenn Schorr","I appreciate that. The one quick follow-up is on the tax rate. I get it. This has got to be super complex, but I'm curious what might be the big items that would push you towards the top or the bottom of that range in terms of what gets allowed, disallowed in the future.","James Gorman","Jon might have more details on it, but I think it's a little premature to try and parse that right now. The big takeaway is this firm has operated with a 31%, 32% global tax rate. Over time, we have become more U.S.-centric, not less, frankly, by design, built around our strategy of being in the Wealth Management business, which is probably 98% U.S., something like that. Now -- we sold our European business several years ago. So we've sort of labored under a pretty high global tax rate. There aren't many institutions that are operating with 32% or above global tax rates. Certainly, there aren't many U.S. institutions. So we are a clear beneficiary of this, and we have established range with a lot of rules. I'm not going to get into all of the details yet, and I think that's for our accountants to work through, but we thought it appropriate to put a range around it just not to get too cute.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell","Just a quick question. I guess, is there an impact from Steinhoff or I guess, the appropriate euphemism is a single client. Did you have any issues this quarter with that?","James Gorman","With Steinhoff? No, we did not.","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, no.","James Mitchell","Okay, so there's no impact there. Okay, that's great. And then maybe bigger picture on efficiency ratio. The gross-up in PBT in '18 on the accounting change. Can you give us -- help us a little bit more on specificity around that? What would the efficiency ratio be in '17 with that? Or put some numbers around it or somehow help us think about what you're efficiency target means in the context of that change.","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. So as James mentioned, the new revenue rec rules will primarily affect Investment Banking as well as Investment Management. I think I said in the script, the 72.6% would have translated to approximately 73% efficiency ratio for the firm. Again, it's going to be a function of activity levels and expenses related to deals, which is what's driving the biggest change, but sort of in that 40 basis points, which is about $400 million plus or minus both to the revenue and the expenses. The other thing to note is that also we'll obviously have an impact on our comp ratio. While it increases the efficiency ratio, it decreases the comp ratio slightly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","First one on Wealth Management. Helpful to get an update on your targets here with the strategic review. Just curious on the 26% to 28% pretax margin target in wealth. You finished out this year -- or you generated 25.5% this year. You've got in excess of 100 basis points tailwind from retention. You've got, as you highlighted, several other factors driving improvement there. So I guess the question is, the lower end seems pretty conservative, particularly if we think about 2019 when those retention packages roll off. And you've got a primary competitor that's pointed to a 30% long-term target, albeit no date tied to that. So is there any reason why you would think that competitors would have a higher margin upside than yours? And is the framing that the lower end is probably pretty conservative, fair on my part?","James Gorman","Brennan, competitors would not have a higher target than ours unless they had a very different deposit base, which at least one competitor does. But even with that, I think the scale in our business would suggest not. So that's fair. Number two, is it conservative? I guess, I'm coming from -- maybe I'm a little scarred from all the years when on these calls people used to ask if we'd ever get to 15% ROE. So I thought, in our dreams, if we put out a 26% to 28% ROE with revenue growth, that would -- sorry, margin growth, with revenue growth, that would be an extraordinary outcome. And here we are on the cusp of 2018, where I think you're right, if the markets cooperate and with the retention roll-off, although we don't know exactly how that all plays out, if the markets cooperate -- and retention roll-off, I think, is in January of '19 -- 2019, certainly the bottom end of this range, would be, I think you're accurate, it's a conservative number. But we live in a world of great uncertainty.","We're investing a fair bit in our digital platform. And the point we wanted to make in the introductory comments was, notwithstanding those investments, we've been able to keep the non-comp expenses actually slightly down over the time period. So yes, you're probably -- it's probably a fair characterization, but I wouldn't get ahead of the top end of this range. We got to -- a lot can happen in these markets, and I don't think we serve anybody well by just focusing on our margin. We've also want to focus on our revenue growth. And one of the things that was exciting about this businesses here was just how much revenue growth there was.","Brennan Hawken","Yes, no, that's all fair. And we won't quote you on the Freudian slip of 20-plus percent ROEs there. No problem.","James Gorman","Yes, well that's not even Freudian. That's not even a bad dream. I mean, the only way you get a 20-plus percent ROE in these businesses is by doing something you don't want us to do right now.","Brennan Hawken","No, of course. Of course. I just couldn't help that. And then a follow-up on wealth. So we've all focused on the corporate changes to the tax code. But of course, individual tax code changed rather materially. Curious whether or not you're seeing an uptick in Wealth Management client engagement yet? Or do you expect that to pick up? And how are you prepping to ensure that such request for advice would translate into an expansion of those critical relationships for you guys?","Jonathan Pruzan","I would say a couple of things. Client engagement has been very high throughout the course of the year. We've seen, as markets globally have been generally very strong, the cash in our clients' accounts has been down. And we're now at an equity level, in terms of the $2.4 trillion of client assets, that's really are in all-time high. Almost 54% of client assets are in equities, and that's been steadily increasing since 2012. So there's been generally a lot of engagement throughout the course of the year. I think that will pick up and continues to pick up when there are major changes like this. And again, we think that our clients are looking for advice, and we will engage with them. A lot of the investments that we made in digital has helped our offices and our FAs free up more time so they can focus on their clients and not work on some of the administrative responsibilities that they have. And I think that's also going to lead to some of the growth momentum that we have in the margin and in the revenues. So topics like this are things for people who want to hear from their FAs and our clients -- or excuse me, and our FAs are out spending time with their clients.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","You guys have done a very good job in increasing your market shares, particularly in trading and equity trading, even though the total wallet size has declined. Can you share with us the strategies you used to do that? And second, some of the European competitors have struggled, and they seem to be back on their feet. So should we expect the environment to get more competitive going forward?","Jonathan Pruzan","I would say, just on the competitive environment, this is an extraordinarily competitive industry across all of our business segments. And where there's pockets of weakness maybe out of one geography, there's always someone trying to get into the business or making a big push. So I think the competitive dynamic that we see hasn't changed dramatically. We compete effectively in this environment. And as you just said, we have been able to grow share. Again, I would say that the resulting share gains across the major businesses is just a function of consistency, of client dialogue and engagement, putting our clients first, offering holistic solutions. Our global network has been in place for quite some time. And as people are allocating more and more capital outside of the U.S., that global network has been a real competitive advantage. So I think it's just, again, some very basic blocking and tackling and staying in front of our clients as the global markets have changed.","James Gorman","I would just add on the -- particularly some of the global trading businesses. While some of the Europeans may be reinvesting, they tend to be reinvesting around banking and trading. It's my observation that there are still balance sheet questions that have got to be sorted out over time, the size of balance sheet. So I think you're right that there are probably a couple of institutions that would move forward in these businesses more aggressively than the last several years would suggest. But there's another category, it's what I call the sort of a national champions. There are a lot of institutions that do very well in their home market. And from time to time, particularly in good trading markets, they have tried to expand that platform globally and generally, those situations sort of get washed out. They sort of retreat back to their home market.","Now obviously, I'm not going to name institutions, but these are global businesses, and they're expensive businesses. If you're not -- if you haven't got decent share, they're very expensive. As we've proven in equities on the positive and we proved in Fixed Income on the negative. We've now addressed some of that with fixed income. So the pickup in market share is very welcome, but it was clearly part of the strategy that we had to get back to a sustainable level, which is kind of the zone that we're now operating in.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then as a follow-up, Jon, you mentioned, you touched on the MiFID comments, that you're supporting the clients through MiFID. Is -- can you give us any idea of what type of revenue impact MiFID might have on you guys? Or is it too early at this point still?","Jonathan Pruzan","I think you answered your question. It is too early. We believe it's manageable given the size of your franchise. There hasn't been any real disruption in the trading environment. And in terms of the long-term impact, it's way too early to call. But we are #1 in the world in this business, and we think we're well positioned to handle it.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O'Connor","Can you guys hear me?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes.","Matthew O'Connor","You guys have talked about potentially doing acquisitions within the asset management area. And I'm just wondering like as you step back, can you think about kind of the new regulatory environment, global growth picking up, what other areas are you thinking about strategically investing, maybe one you wouldn't before? And then kind of a subsegment of that, are there areas that you're interested in taking a little more risk than maybe you had in recent years, given the better macro backdrop and regulatory backdrop?","Jonathan Pruzan","So again, I think we've been broadly investing in the franchise across all of the businesses. Investment Management is still an area that we'd like to continue both organically and inorganically look at opportunities; and if something comes around, like the Mesa West, which was a good cultural fit, good product fit and fit very nicely into the franchise. I would say, broadly, in the other businesses, clearly, we think there is some probably opportunity geographically in ISG. On the organic side, we'd like to continue to invest in Asia as people put more capital into that region as transparency and liquidity improves. So I think there's an opportunity for us, but I don't think that would be, per se, acquisitive. That might be more organic. And then on the advisory -- excuse me, on the Wealth Management side, as we said, we are at scale. So we don't need to do anything there, but there could be some -- could be interesting opportunities. We have plenty of capital and capacity to do things, which puts us in a good position. So I think we'll continue to invest in the businesses and drive continued returns.","Matthew O'Connor","And then from a risk-taking point of view, are you more open to maybe taking bigger hold positions within the loan book? Or just how are you thinking about risk-taking kind of broadly speaking? I mean, it never feels good -- never kind of seems like a thing to say that you're willing to take more risk, but it's like the industry has been derisking for several years, including yourself. And now you've got lots of capital, lots of liquidity. There's opportunity to optimize the CET1 versus the SLR. So around the edges, are there some areas that you're willing to take a little more risk than a few years ago?","Jonathan Pruzan","Listen, as you say, we have derisked the franchise, improved our capital and liquidity positions. We're always there to support our clients. We have significant risk capacity. To the degree client activity picks up, we'll be there to support them. You saw our VaR number is really at a multiyear low. So we do have the capacity to increase, but it's going to be a function of what clients want to engage in.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet.","Steven Chubak","I wanted to start off with a question on the investment strategy. And I know, Jon, you had just made some remarks on this topic. But Wealth Management in recent years, it's certainly been helped by your strong expense discipline. You spoke about your ability to make investments in digital technology while keeping that expense base flattish. And I'd say you've been a positive outlier relative to a lot of your peers in that regard within that business. I'm just curious, underlying the 26% to 28%, which James, you noted as conservative, what assumptions are you making on non-comp inflation? And then in addition to that, since it's been asked by a few investors, maybe you could speak to deposit beta assumptions in that segment as well.","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. Again, what we've been able to do in wealth, a, it's a very large business with $15 billion-odd of revenues, and we grew it at 10%. So we had significant revenue growth behind the margin improvement. Two, as we've been able to rein in non-comp expenses, we have been reinvesting. If we hadn't reinvested, actually, the noncomps would have gone down pretty dramatically. As you know, recruiting generally drives some of that expense leverage. And as deals have burned off and we have the biggest chunk of our deals burning off in January of '19, but deals have burned off every year as we hire people. And so we've been able to reinvest those savings, which is a comp number, and put it into our digital and bank platform. So I would expect that noncomps will grow but at a much slower pace than revenues, and we will continue to see operating leverage and the benefits of scale. And now I forgot your first question.","Steven Chubak","Deposit beta.","Jonathan Pruzan","Deposit beta. Thank you. So listen, we had 3 hikes last year. And if you look at it over the course of the full year, betas were pretty low and realized betas were much lower than our projected model beta of 50%. We raised rates across our network in the second quarter, which I think was the second rate hike of the year. And it went from an average of about 1 basis point to, I think, about 6 or 7. So that was a 5 basis point, 6 basis point type of move on the 25 basis points. But over the full year, it was even lower because of the averaging effect. On the heels of this last rate hike, in December, across the platform, we raised rates by about, on average, 10 basis points. So you've basically gone from a virtual 0 beta to a 20 beta to a 40 beta. So again, I think the betas are going to start to look a lot more like our expected modeled betas of about 50%. But certainly, they're higher than they were last year.","James Gorman","Let me just add in a couple of comments about the margin because I didn't -- I don't want you to misunderstand us. I don't think the range of 26% to 28% is conservative. I think -- what I was suggesting was, given what's going on in the business, the bottom end of that range, we think, is very doable and we should achieve it. In my recollection, and maybe I'm wrong, but I think there's only one firm in the history of the Wealth Management business, and I'm aware of its size, that has generated margin above 28%. And that was, in fact, Smith Barney. And I think it was in 1999, and it was right before the dot-com bust. And it's when retail investors were trading at a level that was both unprecedented and unhealthy. So now the business models have changed a lot since then. There's all the banking deposits, et cetera, et cetera. But just for historical context, a 29% margin outside of this range would be the first time in the history of the industry. So I think we got to be a little cautious here. I'm much more interested in trying to drive revenue growth in that business at 7% with a 27% margin than at 3% with a 28% margin. ","So the playoff between revenue growth and margin expansion are the 2 things that we've got to keep in mind here. That said, we put the range out there because that's what we think we will achieve over these 2 years.","Steven Chubak","Fair enough, James. Thanks for clarifying your remarks there. Just one more for me on capital. To follow-up to Glenn's question, you noted that you expect no meaningful change in equity or the ROE denominator as part of the targets that you've outlined. It's pretty clear that you're more than adequately capitalized at this point. Just wondering, if you do, in fact, have some favorable regulatory changes as outlined by the treasury, do you see sufficient capacity to actually shrink that denominator over time while still balancing that with the need to remain prudent on capital and liquidity?","James Gorman","Again, I think it's a very fair question. We've been through many years of CCAR now. You look at our Core CET1 ratios. Core capital ratios are very, very strong. The one that's been closely aligned has been the leverage ratio. It remains -- I don't think a lot is going to change in 2018. 2019 going forward, it remains unclear whether there will be any regulatory changes to which of the ratios are the more dominant ratios or not. There's some suggestion of that. There's some suggestion that maybe -- it's something we have pushed for a long time, to growing the balance sheet under the CCAR models. And I think 4% a year, frankly, makes no sense. There's no way your balance sheet's going to grow unless you're acquiring somebody during a time of severe economic stress. So if that were to happen, that obviously impacts our leverage ratio a lot.","Our current payout, I think, is around 90 -- I'm looking at Jon, about 95%, thereabouts. We're accreting higher than the payout ratio that we're putting out right now. So at a minimum, we would -- we are big believers in not hoarding capital unnecessarily. So at a minimum, you would expect to see those kinds of payout ratios. And then, yes, if we got some serious change, we think, as an institution, we're over capitalized. We think we're over capitalized by several billion dollars. And frankly, on a global basis, I think there's a lot that would support that. So if we got some change that allowed us to take action on that, I think that's something -- in the absence of finding better ways to invest it or better things to buy, we believe in being very shareholder friendly on this stuff.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski","First question is on FICC. You guys have been very on point over the last couple of years in terms of your wallet view and the fact that it would be stuck. But I was interested in 2 comments. One, that there was a lot of operating leverage built into the system if it began to grow again, and then one that I think James made during the strategic presentation to the effect that -- and it sounded like you believe that, at this point, the wallet could expand, I guess, on normalization of vol or something. But I was wondering if you could elaborate on how you're thinking about that.","James Gorman","I mean, Guy, given your reference to my comments, I'll start. And first, I just want to acknowledge the job the team did with Sam Kellie-Smith, who we put in to run FICC from equities; Ted Pick, who's now overseeing both equities, which is the #1 franchise, and Fixed Income; and of course, Colm Kelleher, our President, who's overseen this transition over the last several years. I think that group has done a phenomenal, phenomenal job and the team working with them. I think what we're seeing in fixed -- what we said in Fixed Income was, if we couldn't generate on average and we fully expected we'd have quotas that wouldn't meet the average, in fact, fourth quarter didn't meet the average, but on average, $1 billion a quarter, we had a real open question about whether we've taken the right strategy when we downsized 25%, was it enough, was it too much, et cetera, et cetera. And we feel really good about where that's been.","On average, for two years now, for 8 quarters, we've generated $1.25 billion, I think, on average. I think it's been 5 years -- $5 billion roughly plus or minus for both years. And as we anticipated, there's some volatility. I think we have one quarter in there maybe a year ago where it's around $1.7 billion. And we had a quarter like the last one, where it's a bit over $800 million. We didn't get -- we don't get too anxious about that. We're not trying to make Fixed Income a $3 billion a quarter business. So we're not going to be disappointed when it's not. What we wanted was it to be on average. Now what's happened and what we tried to talk about in the opening comments was the market environment last year was tougher. The industry [ph] reported revenues were down, and the team picked up share against that. Projecting forward, I think we'd say 2 things. Obviously, we're keen to hold on to that share, but that can be frankly a mix of macro, micro and all the sub businesses. But secondly, we think that the -- with the global movement, particularly in the U.S. in rates, and just look where the 10-year, I think it was over 2.60% this morning, we're at 2.20% a month ago roughly, you're getting some activity into the rates market. Our credit complex has held up very well. Our SPG business is a terrific business. So do we think that the global revenues pick up? Yes, we do. And do we think that we hold our share or something close to this share with that? Yes, we think that's reasonable. And with that by definition, you've got a significant potential upside in this. But we're not counting on that. We can't predict the revenues. We're not going to. And the good news is, we sit here saying, \"If it doesn't play out that way, we're fine with it.\" I mean, we always want more, but we've got these other businesses for good reasons. And they will -- they are much more stable in these market environments. Jon, I don't know if you want to add, too.","Jonathan Pruzan","No, I think that's right. For two years, we put up on average $5 billion when we saw better markets and we saw worse markets. And we do believe there will be volatility in this business quarter-to-quarter, but we feel good at the position that we're at. And we think that in an improving market, which again, early days, if you just look at the 10-year, if you look at rate expectations or [indiscernible], they've all picked up a little bit here. But in a better market backdrop, we would expect to participate in that recovery. We have capacity to do that. And we'll have to see where the year plays out. But in a rising market, we do expect to play in that.","Guy Moszkowski","That was really helpful. And then the follow-up question would be on the theme of reinvestment. Obviously, that's driven a lot of conversations with investors over the last few weeks. Discrete type of benefits like taxes. Or in your case, one of the things that's coming up in a year or so is the runoff of the retention contracts in Wealth Management. Specifically to that, why should we not think that you would have to reinvest most of that in ongoing recruiting and retention?","James Gorman","Most of the runoff?","Guy Moszkowski","Yes, in the retention. The 100 basis points or so in runoff of those contracts that would otherwise just fall to the bottom line.","James Gorman","Well, I mean, because those deals were put in place for a very specific reason, I think that about 6,000 of our financial advisers back when we did the deal out of 18,000 and now put in place because we recognize, particularly for our advisers with larger complex books, it was a lot of dislocation. We took basically everybody, 16,000 advisers and tens of thousands of assistant, support staff in the branches and we put them on a completely new system. They had to learn new protocols. They had to -- they had a new user interface, so dealing with a new financing planning tool. It was a lot of dislocation for them and their clients. And we felt it was only fair to do that. Once your business is normal, you don't have -- we don't pay our investment bankers retention payments. We don't pay our sales traders. We don't pay our risk managers, and we don't pay our financial advisers. That's just not business as normal. So we won't be doing that. This has been 9 years we amortized [indiscernible] deals are paid partly upfront and partly over time. And it's been a very happy result for our advisers. They deserved it. And obviously, thrilled that they got this. But that's not business as usual.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.","Michael Mayo","James, I think you gave me this answer before. So the answer is a journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step. The question is, why aren't your new targets even higher?","James Gorman","Oh my God, Mike Mayo. We've got a target -- I thought you'd be calling up to say you finally have a 10% plus target.","Michael Mayo","Well, listen to my thought process and correct where you think I'm wrong, and I think the answer is going to be partly because you're reinvesting. But you're at a 9.4% ROE in 2017. And with the new lower tax rate, you're in your new range of 10% to 13%. Your efficiency target of under 73%. You're at 73% in 2017. And Wealth Management, the margin -- again, it's great progress this decade, but your range is 26% to 28%, and you're already at 25.5%. And with the expiration of some of the contracts, you'll be in range. So it looks like it's just looking at your results in 2017 and the things that are definite that you should make your new 2018 to 2019 target. So I guess, my question is, are your new targets high enough?","James Gorman","Well, listen, it's a fair question. I think -- just step back from it a minute and think about how we operate as management. We don't do less because we're suddenly getting ahead of one of our targets. We don't stop and not work. So if we can produce results above and beyond these results, we're in that all day long. We're all shareholders. We're highly motivated. Senior management is paid. A lot of their compensation is based on performance units, which is tied to -- half of it's tied to ROE, half tied to total shareholder returns. So we are all in on delivering better results than what we've publicly said. On the other hand, we don't have credibility as a management team if we put out things which are artificially designed so that to boost confidence.","But we have a low degree of confidence that in a more challenged environment, a more -- these market environments don't always go in a straight line and things happen in these businesses. We're pretty comfortable we can achieve these targets in a more challenged -- not a difficult, not a major recession, but certainly a more difficult market environment. And I think it's in that context that we put the lower end of the ranges. But -- and thirdly, we're just dealing with a lot of uncertainty. We don't know -- I think the regulatory bias will be to provide some relief over time. I don't know that. We might be wrong. I think that interest rates -- there's [indiscernible] be more than two Fed hikes this year. We don't know that, and we are projecting that, that would be absorbed by the market, and we wouldn't tip the country into recession, we can't predict all of that. We think that we are investing at the right level for our businesses, but we don't know that.","And maintaining an efficiency ratio of under 73%, when I think we started this -- I forget the number, but it was over 80%. If we have good revenue growth and invest behind the business and still keep our efficiency rate under 73%, that would be a terrific outcome. So I think we're just -- it's not like several years ago when we started off in quite a stress situation and we felt like we needed to show investors that we could be okay. We're more than okay now. And I think we've got to be smart about this and leave ourselves and all of you the room for us to invest where we find sensible opportunities. And at the end of the day, our results, well, we've got these '18, '19 targets. We have much longer time frame that we are focused on as a firm.","Michael Mayo","Just one short follow-up. I know you're not relying on this, but Jon, you mentioned high confidence that trading would not remain at the low fourth quarter level. What are some items that you're looking at that gives you that confidence? And how has trading been so far this year?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, very, very early days. Only the 18th, and I think 11 trading days to date. But level of engagement with clients across the complex, as James mentioned, the 10-year now backed up over 20 basis points in the last 2 weeks. We've seen expectation in rate hikes going from 2% to 2.5% in the last 2 weeks. We've seen rate volatility and FX volatility increase in the last 2 weeks. So very early days. But there is signs that from a sales and trading perspective, we are seeing heavy levels of engagement and a little bit more vol and a little bit more activity. And we're obviously in earnings season. So there's just more stuff going on. So we feel good about the start, but very early days.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Just one on the taxes. So just given the range of the 22% to 25%, just -- how are you guys thinking about all that drop to the bottom line versus reinvesting in the business and the employee base over time? And then Jon, just on the 22% to 25%, does that include some of the noise that we'll see from quarter-to-quarter in the equity comp accounting? I just want to make sure that, that either is or isn't. Because some of the firms are kind of disclosing the ranges a bit differently.","Jonathan Pruzan","I'll take the second part first on the actual tax rate. So as you rightfully point out, 22% to 25%, I think is -- not I think, is the full year target. There will be volatility around that number and in the first quarter because tomorrow, I think, is our vesting event, which is the main component of the stock that we'll vest over the course of the year. We'll expect a tax rate lower than that. And then again, clarifications around some of the new regs, earnings mix, geography, all of that will sort of fluctuate, but the first quarter will be our best quarter from a tax rate. And then we think it stabilizes more in the range that we gave you, the 22% to 25% in the out three quarters.","James Gorman","Yes. On the reinvestment, it remains to be seen. But frankly, I don't think it's something that changes our view of overall compensation in a material way. We pay on performance, and we pay based on the firm's performance and how we're doing in each of our businesses. For opportunities to invest, if we find attractive opportunities to invest in that we think we can generate high returns on, we'll invest. And if we don't, we'll give the money back to shareholders. That's shareholders have been hanging in on this up for a long time to generate good returns. And this is one of the things that we'll hope generate that. So good opportunities to invest in, we'll take them. Look after our employees, absolutely. We expect to pay competitively always. And second -- and thirdly, absent those 2 things, it will go back to shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Fan Yang with HSBC.","Fan Yang","What are the drivers of the net interest margin in the Wealth Management? If you have, for example, 3 rate hikes next year, how much of it do you expect to flow through to your net interest margin? And especially on the funding cost, do you expect the deposit beta to increase as well with each rate hike?","Jonathan Pruzan","So on the NII within wealth, you -- as you know, we've actually grown that line pretty dramatically over $2.5 billion in the last 5 years, so averaging about $500 million per annum. And that's been a function of growing the loans and deploying our excess liquidity. As we continue to penetrate our client base with the loan product, our expectations is that there's still room to grow the loan book within wealth, probably at a little slower rate, given some of the dynamics around rising rates in mortgage and the transition that we're going through. But we grew loans by over $7 billion last year. We would hope to continue to grow. It's also over a bigger base. So the percentage increase will decline. So we'll continue to see NII growth driven by loan growth. As I mentioned earlier, we do expect the betas to be higher this year than last year. And because of the funding mix, it's shifting a little bit away from the core single product that we used to have 2 or 3 years ago to a more diversified liability structure. We will see an increase in the funding costs. But bottom line, NII will grow. It will just grow at a slower pace than 2017.","Fan Yang","And then what about on the margin basis? Is the absolute amount will grow? Will the margin grow as well due to the rate hikes? [Indiscernible]","Jonathan Pruzan","By definition, yes. I mean, again, we don't look at sort of a net interest margin in the wealth business. But by definition, we would expect the yields to grow faster than the interest expense. So we'll have improvement in the NIM, which we don't really track.","Operator","And our last question will come from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP securities.","Devin Ryan","One here just on tax reform. I mean, a lot of talk about better client engagement or sentiment across the business as a result, and it would seem to me maybe that most directly impacts U.S. clients. But are you seeing that maybe positive sentiments build into better engagement abroad? What are the puts and takes there? I'm asking more about outside of the U.S. And then also, where does GWM expansion outside of the U.S. fit into the kind of the priority list, if at all?","Jonathan Pruzan","Listen, I think tax reform broadly being accomplished those two things, one, the positive benefits that we just all talked about, but two, eliminate an uncertain outcome. And when uncertainties get reduced, you generally see higher activity levels. So I do think this will be helpful overall to the M&A franchise and some of the other things that corporates are looking at around the world as they now know what the new corporate tax rate is going to look like and they can make informed decisions. Broadly speaking, again, CEO confidence is very high. The data suggests continuation of global growth and sort of very positive macro. I think -- someone told me this the other day, so if it's wrong, we can blame someone else, but of the 192 participants in the IMF, 186 are experiencing growth around the world. So we've not seen that I think ever. So again, I think people feel pretty good about the global growth picture, and we see significant client dialogues and engagement.","Devin Ryan","Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up here on the NII questions. Where do you think you are in the securities-based loan opportunity or penetration there? And then just kind of bigger picture, just given where the interest rate curve is and what we're seeing happening on kind of the longer end, what would make you think differently about the duration of the book or that as an opportunity?","Jonathan Pruzan","I think from a penetration standpoint, we saw a couple of billion dollars of growth in the SBL product the last couple of years, and we think that we'll continue to see that type of level of growth. Obviously as a percentage basis, it's slowing. But absolute number has been pretty consistent over the last couple of years. And if you look at our penetration and activity levels at FA at that level, again, we still believe that there's incremental growth in that product. Number one, in terms of our overall positioning hasn't changed very much. As you said, I think there is a view, whether right or wrong, of somewhere between two and three rate hikes for 2018. I think there is a lot of disagreement potentially on the shape of the curve and what happens in the middle to the long end. But from our positioning standpoint, we haven't really increased our duration very much, and our interest rate risk profile hasn't changed that dramatically.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James P. Gorman","Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here with Ruth to discuss our first quarter results today. There were several significant highlights in the quarter, but it's important to remind you of some of the steps we've taken to reach this point. For the past 2 years, our team has systematically executed in a number of areas including: selling certain assets and eliminating legacy positions to move beyond the crisis; rebuilding and investing in the client footprint in Institutional Securities, implementing the MSSB integration; increasing fee-based assets and improving the profit margin in that business; deepening and strengthening our partnership with MUFG; building and maintaining a conservative capital, liquidity and leverage profile; and finally, not unimportantly, maintaining strong expense discipline. While this has been a long and at times, arduous journey, our results this quarter are evidence we're on the right track. Ruth will take you through the GAAP results in detail, but let me underscore a few things. ","x DVA, our revenue, net earnings, EPS and ROE for the quarter were among the highest since the financial crisis. ROE was over 9%. IC revenues were particularly strong with significant progress in Fixed Income, driven by improved balance sheet velocity and VAR efficiency. This was coupled with continued strength in equities despite challenging markets. We reached an important milestone in the quarter with the successful move for the first wave of legacy Smith Barney Advisors to our new technology platform, with the rest to follow in early May and early July. We are just 11 weeks away from completion of this integration. ","Our strategic partnership with MUFG continues to grow as we deepen client relationships and leverage our combined balance sheet to deliver financial solutions. Finally, we have delivered on the promise of expense control. We're disciplined in the approach to compensation, and while overall compensation expense rose, of course, with higher revenues, the actions we've taken in the last few years, we meaningfully reduced the ratio, striking a balance between driving ROE and investing in the franchise. ","Similarly, our rigorous non-compensation expense program allowed us to keep a tight rein on spending, and thus, drove significant operating leverage. Clearly, we still have work to do to reach our goals, and I believe the progress we have made further underscores the strength of this franchise globally. I'll now turn it over to Ruth to take you through our earnings in detail.","Ruth Porat","Good morning. To provide greater transparency into our results, I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We will present our results this way, whether the impact is positive or negative, and have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures. DVA in the quarter was negative $2 billion with $381 million in equity sales and trading and $1.6 billion in Fixed Income sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were $8.9 billion, up 24% sequentially, excluding the impact of the MBIA settlement in the fourth quarter. Noninterest expenses were $6.7 billion, up 10% versus the fourth quarter. ","Compensation expenses of $4.4 billion this quarter included approximately $138 million related to severance. Non-compensation expenses were $2.3 billion, down 2% from last quarter, reflecting firm-wide cost-containment efforts. ","Income from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders was approximately $1.3 billion. Net income from continuing operations per diluted share was $0.71 after preferred dividends. ","On a reported or [ph] GAAP basis, firm-wide revenues for the first quarter were $6.9 billion, up 22% sequentially. Income from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders was a loss of approximately $103 million, and the reported net loss from continuing operations per diluted share was $0.05 after preferred dividends. ","Book value at the end of the quarter was $30.74 per share. Tangible book value was $27.37 per share. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed on the sale of Quilter and the first phase of the Saxon disposition. ","Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets were $781 billion at March 31, up from $750 billion last quarter, reflecting increased client activity. Our liquidity pool was $179 billion at the end of the quarter. Although our calculations are not final, we believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I will be approximately 13.2%, and our Tier 1 capital ratio will be approximately 16.8%. Risk-weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately $319 billion at March 31. Subject to final rule-making, our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was between 8% and 9% pro forma as of the end of the first quarter, assuming full Basel III inflation of RWAs and 0 benefit from mitigation. We're in the range as a function of the ultimate revolution around Basel 2.5 NPR. We expect that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III at the end of 2012 will approach 10%, reflecting passive mitigation driven by position roll off and consensus earnings. ","Now turning to our businesses in detail. Unless otherwise noted, all discussion of income statement metrics and segment results will exclude DVA for the remainder of my remarks in order to differentiate revenues associated with our business from those associated with our borrowings that result solely from our credit spreads. ","In Institutional Securities, revenues were $5 billion. Excluding the impact of the MBIA loss last quarter, revenues were up 39% sequentially. Noninterest expenses were $3.3 billion, up 17% versus the fourth quarter. The compensation ratio is 42% in the quarter. Non-compensation expenses declined 5% from last quarter. The business reported a pretax profit of $1.7 billion. ","Our Investment Banking results reflect the backdrop of continued low market activity, resulting in revenues of $851 million, down 4% versus last quarter. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked #1 in global IPOs and #2 in global completed M&A and global announced M&A at the end of the first quarter. Notable transactions included Glencore's $49 billion acquisition of Xstrata; AIG's $6 billion follow-on equity offering; a $7.2 billion investment-grade bond offering for Petrobras; and a $2.8 billion noninvestment-grade bond offering for United Rentals. ","Advisory revenues of $313 million were down 23% versus the fourth quarter as market volumes remain subdued, particularly in the Americas. ","Equity underwriting revenues were $172 million, a 9% decline from the fourth quarter, reflecting an industry-wide decline in IPO volume and an unfavorable shift in mix. ","Fixed income underwriting revenues of $366 million were up 27% versus last quarter with significantly higher bond issuance activity in both investment-grade and high-yield products. This strength was partially offset by a decline in syndicated loan revenues, which were negatively affected by lower levels of event financing. ","Equity sales and trading revenues were $1.83 billion, an increase of 44% from last quarter. Results reflected continued broad-based performance across geographies and products despite lower market-wide volumes. Client revenues remained resilient, demonstrated -- demonstrating ongoing realization of adjacencies across products and diversification of distribution across client segments. ","Prime brokerage revenues were up on higher balances and a more favorable mix of activity. We continue to gain market share with notable outperformance in electronic and retail. Strong results also benefited from prudent risk management. ","Fixed Income and Commodities sales and trading revenues were $2.6 billion. Excluding the MBIA loss last quarter, revenues were more than double and were up 30% versus a year ago. Results this quarter reflected broad based strength and were also balanced across products and geographies. Stronger performance year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter underscores our continued emphasis on flow products, risk efficiency and increased velocity, with average balance sheets below 4Q '11 and 1Q '11 levels. ","Each of our major product areas contributed meaningfully to results this quarter. Rates revenues increased, driven by higher client volumes benefiting from prior investments in our footprint. ","FX results were up with lower balance sheet and continued to benefit from our investment in technology. Credit revenues were up both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, reflecting improved credit markets and balance sheet efficiency. Commodities revenues rebounded from a slower fourth quarter as client activity, including structure transactions, increased. Securitized products revenues were up sequentially but down versus a strong 1Q '11 comparison. ","The other sales and trading line reflects negative revenues of $286 million versus positive $83 million last quarter. ","Turning to VAR, average total VAR declined from $123 million in the fourth quarter to $84 million this quarter using a 4-year data series. The decline reflects the full quarter impact of the MBIA settlement that occurred last December. Period-end VAR declined from $87 million at the end of the fourth quarter to $78 million at the end of the first quarter. Our average aggregated VAR by primary risk category for the quarter was $72 million versus $66 million in the fourth quarter. ","Global Wealth Management revenues of $3.4 billion were up 6% versus the prior quarter, driven by higher Asset Management fees and an increase in transaction-driven revenues. Specifically, Asset Management revenues were up 7% due to the benefit of higher equity market levels at the start of the quarter. GWM's Investment Banking-related fees increased 24% versus last quarter, primarily driven by fixed income new issuance. ","Trading revenues were up 19% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting increased activity and markups in deferred compensation plans. Commissions were roughly flat to last quarter. The other revenue line included lower gains on AFS sales versus the fourth quarter. Noninterest expenses were $3 billion, up 2% from last quarter. Compensation ratio was 62% versus 64% last quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $922 million, flat to the fourth quarter. Migration costs were approximately $75 million. As the integration is completed, we expect these expenses to taper off during the year. ","Profit before tax was $387 million, while the PBT margin was 11%, up from 7% last quarter. NCI for the quarter was $74 million, up from $16 million in the fourth quarter. ","Total client assets increased to $1.7 trillion due to market appreciation and net asset inflows in the quarter. Global fee-based asset flows were $8.7 billion. Fee-based assets under management grew to $531 billion at quarter end, up 8% year-over-year. ","Global representatives at quarter end were 17,193. Bank deposits were $112 billion at the end of the quarter with approximately $57 billion held in Morgan Stanley banks. ","Asset Management revenues of $533 million were up from $424 million in the fourth quarter due primarily to markups in Merchant Banking and real estate funds and higher Asset Management fees. In Traditional Asset Management, revenues of $342 million were up 18% compared to the fourth quarter due to higher market levels. ","In Real Estate Investing, revenues of $146 million were up 32% versus last quarter. Due to the ownership structure of these funds, the majority of these revenues are passed to third-party investors in the non-controlling interest line. ","In Merchant Banking, revenues of $45 million increased from $23 million in the fourth quarter, driven by higher markups on investments. Compensation expense was $218 million in the quarter, up from $183 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher revenue. Profit before tax was $128 million, up 64% from last quarter. NCI was $65 million versus $44 million last quarter, reflecting markups and consolidated real estate funds. ","Total AUM increased to $304 billion due to higher market levels. ","In conclusion, the global markets continue to be affected by ongoing macro uncertainties, but we remain focused on that which we can control. The strategic steps we've taken during the last 9 quarters are reflected in our results with broad strength across our businesses globally on an improved revenue mix, tight expense controls and a stronger foundation of capital and liquidity. Three observations. First, with respect to revenue, our results highlight that the firm is far more balanced and diverse today than we have been in some time. In Institutional Securities, we drove revenue gains across our sales and trading franchise the Morgan Stanley way, based on insight, solutions and technology. Our Investment Banking team continues to be engaged in leading significant transactions throughout the world. Our backlogs remain strong. We benefited this quarter from the absence of the legacy items we have addressed in the last 2 years. ","In GWM, after extensive investment and integration work, we are pleased with the platform the team has built. It enhances the FA and client experience, and increases efficiency opportunities by consolidating our business onto one platform. As evidenced by the consistency in revenues, retail wealth management continues to support the stability of the firm's results. It is a more annuity-like, capital-light business that increases its contribution with ongoing growth in both our fee-based assets and our lending business. ","Second, our approach to compensation and non-compensation expenses reflects our disciplined expense management. We continue to have success with our firm-wide cost-containment and reengineering efforts, and expect further benefits over the next 2 years. ","Third, our capital ratios remain industry-leading. We have a balanced and stable funding mix that will further improve as we exercise our MSSB call options, which will, in turn, add to our deposit base. ","Our strategic priorities have also provided funding flexibility. Specifically, as a result of a more liquid flow focused business, we did not refinance the majority of the $16 billion of debt that matured or was retired in the first quarter. Net debt outstanding declined $10 billion in the first quarter, continuing the trend we started last year. Meanwhile, our liquidity pool remained in line with 2011, with ending liquidity of $179 billion. ","As I have noted previously, a key input to the sizing of the liquidity reserve is our upcoming maturities. The combined impact of strong liquidity, the declining maturities going forward, put us in an even stronger position with respect to funding flexibility. Parent liquidity debt coverage is up significantly from 2 years ago, an indication of the strength of our balance sheet and our prudent liquidity risk management. We believe these steps put us in an even better position to serve our clients and our stakeholders. Thank you for listening, and James and I will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Regarding the meaningful improvement across the sales and trading franchises, I was just hoping you could share some thoughts on how you separate what's market-related versus what's related to pay off from all the investments you've made over the past few years.","Ruth Porat","Well, I think we have to start with the investments that we've made over the last couple of years. What we saw this quarter was real strength across products and across geographies, and no one particular driver of results. Across the 5 businesses, all growing kind of within a narrow zone, rates, FX, corporate credit, commodities and investment grade securitization. And what we've been talking to you about over the last number of quarters, quite long number of quarters, is that we felt there was real upside as we moved back in the flow, an area where we've obviously been strong for many years but had underinvested for a period of time and our view was that we were punching below our weight and have the opportunity for market share upside, and invested in particular in rates and FX, and those were 2 of the important drivers. I think the other big driver here was we talked internally about adjacencies when we talk about your equities business, the benefit of adjacencies, which, as we've talked about before, looks at working with clients across the platform. And that approach is very much reflected in the way we're running our Fixed Income business as well. It starts with the leadership team. It starts -- and then goes to our Senior Relationship Management program, our SRM program, and that's yet another investment. And then the third is really the technology investments that we've continued to make. That, in particular, is one I've highlighted over time and it's true again this quarter for our foreign exchange business benefiting from our electronic trading platform. So those all go to investments. I think the fact that we started the quarter with a lower balance sheet and lower inventories really underscores that this is less about marks and more about flow and engagement with clients. And so I would say it helped that there was a -- have a constructive environment, no question, but it goes to what we've been discussing with you repeatedly, quarter after quarter, the investments in the business and the focus.","James P. Gorman","I think also, Howard, the -- I would just take into account the leadership team, Colm Kelleher, who we put in that job a couple of years ago, and Kenny deRegt and Ted Pick in Fixed Income and Equities, respectively. This is now a very seasoned team working extremely well together across the firm. And I do believe the leadership makes a difference.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And switching gears, Ruth, on the new held-for-investment disclosure, you had a near doubling of the HFI portfolio in the last quarter. Now is that a function of new clients or active refinancing? And as that portfolio grows, how do you think about the impact to your stress capital ratios, earnings volatility and hedging costs?","Ruth Porat","Well, that's really the driver of the move. We're clearly a mark-to-market shop as we always talk about, but we are a bank. The 15 floor just depository ballpark today and pro forma for the incremental MSSB deposits will be, ballpark, the 12th largest depository. And as we talked about last quarter under the CCAR scenarios, the impact of loans under HFI were less punitive than fair value. And as we're looking to continue to build out our bank, consistent with other banks' practices and regulatory guidance, we've been focused on what's in the best interest of stakeholders. And our view was that if HFI is viewed as a -- or results in being a more capital-efficient way to run the lending book, that's the appropriate way to migrate our lending book. And so what you've seen here is that movement to HFI this quarter, and you'll continue to see that.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then with respect to the Moody's review, could you just comment on what a downgrade means to you, and what you're all doing to prepare for and maybe prevent a potential downgrade?","Ruth Porat","Sure. We've done a lot to narrow the impact of any potential ratings change and view that -- and our view is that the impact of potential outcomes are manageable. Obviously, ratings reviews started a few years ago, first with S&P and then with Fitch and now with Moody's, and so we have had time to prepare. And so trying to get some perspective on how we look at it or how we think about the impact, structure derivatives is obviously the most affected by ratings change, but it's also an area of focus for regulatory reform. And as we've reduced the scope of our structured derivatives business, that's very consistent with our change in business mix toward cash and flow products. And that's been kind of an over time, and I just comment on with respect to what we're doing broadly in Fixed Income. But what that means is at this point, only 8% of our ISDA contracts have triggers within the Moody's potential range, which helps reduce the size, kind of step 1. The other key point is that a large amount can be centrally cleared, and we were early and aggressive to move to central clearing and become client-central clearing broker. Two of the largest fixed income asset managers were also easy -- early in moving to clearing, and we won mandates to become their clearing brokers. And the trend towards clearing is clearly ratings diagnostics, so that further reduces the pool that\u2019s subject to impact. And then beyond that, we have a higher graded derivatives entity, and we've slowly been moving derivatives into our bank. So that kind of sizes and brings down the scope within, and hopefully, underscores the couple of work streams, which underscore why I started by saying we think the potential outcomes are manageable. The other point, I think, is really key is that none of our funding has ratings triggers. So that side of it is very easy to address as well. I think across the platform, we've done a lot to narrow the potential impact.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great, very helpful, Ruth. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the ongoing business. At a percent of figure you noted, is that just number of ISDA contracts or is that -- what does that mean as a percentage of maybe revenues or earnings contribution today?","Ruth Porat","Yes, that is 8% of ISDA contracts, and that's why I kind of started there and then went down to what are the various incremental steps that we've taken. I think the other thing I would point you to is that we're still A-rated by S&P and Fitch, and a lot of clients are doing their own credit assessments, so hard to gauge how that translates into any other impact on the business.","Operator","The next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to see if we -- if I could just follow up on what you're talking about just now with respect to the Moody's. I know that, that moving contracts into better-rated entities was pretty far down your list of actions that you've taken. But I'm just interested in the idea of using the bank\u2019s unit and any other entity that you might have developed, and sort of how sizable you think that could be in terms of helping you mitigate the impacts.","Ruth Porat","Well, with the respect to the bank broadly, our strategy or objective is to build a robust national bank that's consistent with our Wealth Management business and building a balanced portfolio of assets in the bank, systematically. And I've talked at length, I think, on 2 different topics that are relevant to that. One is building our lending business of institutional and retail, and two is moving derivatives into the bank. And when we've talked about the lending business in particular, on the retail side, I've talked about this being a flow systematic steady build, building out the suite of products that we're offering to our retail clients, taking our time to build that out so that we've got the right credit and quality control over the build. That's one key portion of the asset side. And the other is, we have talked about before, slowly, systematically working to move derivatives into the bank. We started with FX and rates will follow. And our view is the result of both of those steps will be a balanced asset portfolio against $60 billion of deposits, with another $60 billion of deposits to come as we buy in the remaining Morgan Stanley Smith Barney stakes over time. And our view is and have been that we have a higher rated derivatives entity to the extent it's needed and have stayed on this course of a longer-term approach to moving more derivatives into the bank.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And the bank deposit build on the retail side is directly related to the percentage ownership of the joint ventures, isn't that right?","Ruth Porat","As we exercise various tranches of the remaining buy-in for MSSB, we -- with that comes the pro rata portion of deposits, correct.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. I was hoping that maybe you could talk about the restatement of your capital allocations on Page 5 of your supplement. That's always an incredibly helpful disclosure, by the way, as I think we've discussed before, but you did restate it. And I'm not sure I completely understand what the footnote is telling us.","Ruth Porat","So there -- I think one of the key things -- I'm not quite sure what you're referring to, but one of the things as we've allocated here on capital back to MSSB, the reason we increased the allocation to MSSB was consistent with guidance that came out during the CCAR process, which is that associated with NCI under Basel I, one now needs to allocate capital for that NCI. We have been doing that under Basel III and we talked about it last quarter that we had moved from parent capital into MSSB, the NCI portion of capital.","Guy Moszkowski - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that helps. And then just on the Institutional side on the restated basis that you now showed us. I noticed that the capital allocation fell by almost $2 billion in the quarter. Is that related to the reduction in VAR and the reduction in the legacy MBIA position? Or is it something else?","Ruth Porat","I'm not sure. Why don't you follow up with IR on that one?","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First on the Wealth Management business. So you had the improvement in the margin this quarter. Given the integration costs, I just want to make sure, is it that simple, meaning as the $75 million or so of integration expense comes out, we should see that 11%? I think if I just do the math, it will move up to maybe 13%, 13.5%. And then just in the near term, given that we've had the market tailwind, you gave some stats in the past in terms of how sensitive that business is to an improvement there and then as well as rates. Any difference there? Because it feels like we're getting the market, at least for the time being, but just any changes in those sensitivities?","Ruth Porat","The focus on margin is still on mid-teens margin by mid next year. And although we're getting the benefit of reduced integration expense, as you pointed out, we're also having some of that offset by increased software capitalization expense as we've talked about on prior calls. So the way we're driving to the mid-teens margin in part comes from integration expense, although it's not quite as big as that full 75, given software cap. It's also additional cost discipline focus and expense discipline focus, is the continued build out of our lending platform that I just mentioned. And it's also the ongoing growth in managed money. Those are really the key drivers of margin expansion. And that's going to continue as we go through next year. We do get a bit of a benefit, in particular, next year when we're all operating on one platform. It makes some of that second category, the expense discipline cost saving programs easier to implement, but it's really the combination of the same items that we've been discussing over time. And then as it relates to the market benefit, we did get a bit of a lift here, given the S&P started the first quarter higher than it was at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and going into the second quarter, we similarly have a bit of a benefit from that. But the mid-teens guidance was -- mid-teen PBT margin guidance assumed no market benefit. And if we continue to have market benefit, that helps. Similarly, if Fed funds rise, that helps.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the buy-in, so we don't have all the details, but when you think about -- obviously, the valuation will play a part, your other options will play a part. And then just how -- what flexibility you have with the Fed, but when we start thinking about timing of that and in other opportunities, what -- is the likelihood you -- still that occurring during the near term?","James P. Gorman","Well, Michael, it's James. Let me address that. We're -- we've said for a long time that we like this business, it's strategically important to us. And while it's been difficult market conditions for a couple of years, we do think we know how to manage it well and we're in the last 10 weeks of a pretty massive, in fact, historically largest integration. So we're on track and the first call option is available, I believe, at the end of May or the 1st of June. And obviously, at that time or some time before that, we'd have a discussion with \u2013 with our friends at Citigroup on the first call option. We have a pretty clear path over what is now only 2 years to buy the remaining pieces. We feel no particular compulsion or anxiety to accelerate that. We have great clarity around what we're trying to do with the business. Obviously, we're always prepared to listen, but we're in a position where we have a clear path, we have a clear plan. We've had this plan now for over 3 years and we're frankly, rapidly moving to the end of it. So that's where we are right now.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And last one, just on the ROE for the overall business. Obviously, you've seen a pretty good improvement versus the last, call it, 2 years, but you\u2019re still at 9% in a seasonally strong quarter. So when you think about the legacy assets and the things that you've been doing, even on the trading side, like how far along are you in that process? Because clearly, a better macro environment can still get that up, but you also had the seasonality against you. But just wondering how much of getting rid of some of the legacy issues or transitioning under the new regulatory environment is done versus the rest, more of a macro environment improvement will drive stronger revenues?","Ruth Porat","We'll be the first to agree that ROE, we're still on a path of improving over time and it is benefiting from systematic execution in the businesses, but we are in a path. If you just kind of go through the 3 big buckets of categories that should continue to drive ROE, on the Institutional Securities side we felt really good exiting 2011, having addressed the legacy issues that we have been speaking with you about for so long. And exiting those, having those drags gone is helpful. We have been reducing our presence in businesses which, under Basel III are more capital-consuming and moving to a more -- well, model which is more capital efficient, so you get some lift just from the mix of the business and that's continuing. On the GWM side, moving in the direction of the mid-teens PBT margin, after 3-plus years, as James said, will help as we benefit from integration and a higher PBT margin on that business. And then we're continuing our disciplined approach on comp and non-compensation. So those are just -- those are 3 of the bigger levers that will help continue to drive ROE. We're doing a lot more, but we're comfortable on this path.","James P. Gorman","And I would just add, Michael, I think that there were areas of our business that clearly benefited from a, I would call it, a reasonable market environment, not exactly a bullish market environment. But there were areas that did not. I mean, in the first quarter of the new issued calendar in equities, it was not exactly robust. M&A and advisory work, frankly, was very low across the industry. Our Wealth Management business, as Ruth said, with rates that are basically 0 interest rates and no equity calendar, clearly, that business wasn't exactly operating at a seasonal or market high. So there were pluses and minuses as you put it all together with the cost backdrop that we're working on with the integration stuff we've talked about, the continued retooling we've been doing in securities businesses. We're quite comfortable with the path we're on.","Operator","The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So look, the -- I give you credit where credit is due. The trading results were awesome and awesome on a relative basis as well. And everything that you said about the investments made it all make sense. I guess my question is, what's different about this first quarter that produced such a payoff? In other words, if you look at it relative to, say, the last 8, 10 quarters' average, your increase is literally 50% more than everybody else in both equities and FICC. So I don't want to complain, it's great numbers. I'm just curious on what you think that made this first quarter to pay off.","James P. Gorman","Well, I think, Glenn, firstly, quarters, as I've said often, come around with remarkable frequency, every 13 weeks. We're already 3 or 4 weeks into the end of the next month, so we're talking about ancient history here. But I think it's if you look at equities in the last couple of years, this is not a flash in the pan. This has been a pretty considered and deliberate progress with our franchise, I think, had gained market share of over 350 basis points last year and continued to be strong this quarter. Fixed Income, obviously, there was better balance in the business. A lot of the pieces came together nicely across rates, foreign exchange. Our credit rebounded. A little bit of it was environmental as we said, and a little bit of it was the leadership and a little bit of it was the investments we've made in the platform. So I don't regard it as kind of a bolt of lightning out of the sky here. I think it's the aggregation of a series of things that have been steady investments. Every quarter won't look exactly the same, that's for sure. I'm sure we'll see some ups and some downs over the next several quarters, but it shows evidence that the investments we made are in the right direction.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. A question, Ruth, I heard all your comments regarding funding cost and debt issuance or debt decreasing in the quarter. I actually have the opposite question on debt issuance plans going forward. And I think your average maturities in that 5-year range has come down over time where, my intuition would tell me that you'd want to be extending duration especially -- some of the things that Moody's points out on the business needing to stand on its own 2 feet. Can we -- can you help us think through what your debt issuance pay, and so on how you think about today's funding cost, where they should be over time?","Ruth Porat","Yes. The way -- I think it's a great question, and the way I start on that is really looking at funding requirements as a function of our business mix and our balance sheet. And as I spoke about on the last quarter's call, there are really 3 strategic priorities that frame the way I think about funding. First, our strategy for business mix has moved towards flow from structured, and we can fund that efficiently through the secured channel and we are. Second, exiting legacy positions has really decreased the need for unsecured funding. A lot of these positions were less liquid and they were cash-funded, and by exiting them, not only do we -- we free up some of the requirements there. And that was a part of the story this quarter and frankly, over the last couple of quarters. And then the growth of our deposit base, consistent with what we're doing in MSSB, is funding both our corporate and our retail loan book, and enabling us to fund more with the deposit base, it reduces our reliance on unsecured funding. So overall, the strategic moves towards a leaner, more velocity-focused balance sheet have allowed us to extract funding from the balance sheet, which means we're not and we haven't refinanced all the maturities. So specifically, and I made this point, in the first quarter, we paid down $16 billion in debt. We issued $5 billion. In other words, net debt down $10 billion in the first quarter alone. And we've reduced net debt by $16 billion over the past couple of quarters, and we did this while improving revenue strength and capturing market share and maintaining high liquidity. So this is where we really want to be, which is delivering for clients and enhancing our funding. And as I talked about a lot on the last quarter, I felt like I was the beneficiary when I'm thinking about funding of all of the strategic things that have been done. And so very much to your point, our maturities, our rolling 12-month maturities, peaked in September of last year and they've been on a downward trajectory, and that gives us some funding flexibility. And as we think about how to benefit from that funding flexibility, we're looking, as we have consistently over the last several years, at optimizing our unsecured issuance across channels, vanilla debt, structured notes and ongoing work with our partner, MUFG, in the Japanese market with the Uridashi issuance. We're looking across currency and we're being mindful of what's the wham of the overall book. But the way we think about it is, given high liquidity and declining maturities, I mentioned this, liquidity maturity statistic, what's notable is we're now at 38 months coverage. In other words, parent liquidity covers the next 38 months of maturities which is up from 23 months, 2 years ago. And it just goes to the prudent way we're running the balance sheet and the high degree of flexibility we have as a result of it.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Of all that's going on, I would think your credit spreads would be tightening more. Maybe last one on that note...","James P. Gorman","We would agree.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","On that note, with it, again, price aside, I think there's something in it for both sides to do more of MSSB sooner. So price aside, it's highly likely not a big capital call. Is there a thought to just issue a bunch of debt as spreads come in and take the whole thing in?","James P. Gorman","Listen. Obviously, we're not going to talk about a particular transaction. As we've said, our focus is on, number one, getting the integration done. We're 11 weeks away from that. Number two, we will proceed with the first call option, and that's 5 weeks away or something like that. And number three, eventually owning 100% of this business, which we can do on a very clear program over the next 24 months. So I'm in the camp of we like certainty. We have what we think is a well-structured deal that was laid out 3 years ago. We're right at approaching crunch time, which is pretty exciting. But we -- it'd take a lot to encourage us to get off that path.","Operator","The next question will come from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.","Christoph M. Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Yes, I was just wondering -- most of my questions have been asked, but I was looking at the share count and it looked like about 50 million additional shares. What drove that? Was it the annual issuance to employees?","Ruth Porat","I think you have to follow up with IR and they'll give you that.","Operator","The next question will come from Fiona Swaffield with RBC.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of things. On the compensation ratio in the Institutional Securities group, could you talk about whether that is a level that could hold for the year? And then secondly, just to double check my understanding of the 8% to 9%, sorry, on Basel III, look through ratio in Q1, is all of that 100 basis points difference the potential impact of the NPR on Basel 2.5?","Ruth Porat","Certainly. So starting with the compensation ratio, we're accruing what we think is reasonable looking at those absolute dollars and ratios. It's obviously early in the year and the same thing we talked about on prior calls remains, which is we're very focused on balancing, driving ROE on the one hand and compensating and retaining talent that's driving that ROE. And this is obviously an industry-wide balance, but we've got a team refocused on it. And within Institutional Securities, the compensation ratio reflects the severance that I commented on. I think it was just over $100 million, $107 million in ISG alone. So that's part of the overall number, but we're still maintaining that very much that lends, which is we've got to get the balance right to drive ROE while paying the talent that's driving that ROE, and it is early in the year. On the Basel III question, you're absolutely correct that the range really reflects the ongoing uncertainty regarding Basel 2.5 NPR. And until there is greater certainty, we think it's most prudent just to give you a range, and we're within that range. We'll tighten up as we also become more clear.","Operator","The next question will come from Roger Freeman with Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just want to follow up on a couple other questions that have been asked. I guess just on the -- in the sort of the strength of the first quarter, it feels like your strength, your revenue generation actually builds over the course of the quarter with March being stronger, whereas I think others have saw the opposite, January being stronger. I mean was there something that -- were one of these areas particularly strong in March? And then obviously, it's only a couple of weeks into April, but has that momentum carried on?","Ruth Porat","Well, actually, I think we started January coming into the year, I think, with the benefits of LTRO kind of as the tailwind. We started January and things were pretty attractive. I think we were mindful of the fact that we entered the quarter with low balance sheet, and therefore, weren't benefiting from much of a big inventory that would be written up, but sub, a pretty good activity on the sales and trading side in January. I think it got a little muted in the middle of the quarter, and then did end the quarter, to your point, stronger. And I think it's too early to call 3 weeks, 2 weeks into the second quarter. I'd be remiss to try and extrapolate from where we are here, and so much of it continues to be what's going on in the macro environment. You tell me that, and I'll give you a bit of a cleaner forecast for the second quarter. So too early at this point.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I can't figure that out either. So just -- it reminds me another point I want to ask on the balance sheet. So these, to the average balance sheet, your inventory levels were down. Can you characterize how the ending balance sheet may have looked versus the average or versus end of 4Q?","Ruth Porat","The average and ending for the first quarter were pretty consistent. It's in the supplement. They were within -- they were close and they've kind of stayed at those levels. We're continuing to run a sub-$800 billion balance sheet.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I mean, I'm referring more just to your risk capital within the trading business. I think that's what you're referring to.","Ruth Porat","Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, so that, similarly, really has not changed much, continuing to run at the same kind of more modest levels. And I think when we look at the Fixed Income results, we -- it is a story about breadth across a number of product areas. But in particular, when you look at the fact that we ran at low VAR and the balance sheet, where it was, ROA was up nicely, VAR efficiency was up as well. It's continued to run at those kinds of levels, and no change really there.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just back on the credit rating discussion. So your comments around using the higher rate of bank entity, is -- can you -- do you have sufficient capacity, given the size of the bank deposit base that are today to accommodate any existing business that may have technical requirements under \u2013 if the rating were to be downgraded to move [indiscernible]. If you hear Larry Fink\u2019s comments yesterday, saying they will have to move some business away. I mean, can we make sure that Morgan Stanley is not on the ones on the list?","Ruth Porat","Well, that's why I went through the various steps and execution paths. We got multiple execution paths, and that's what gives us the comfort to say that outcomes are manageable. So apart from that, which essentially cleared, you\u2019re focusing really on and what about the rest of it, and as I indicated, we have a higher rated derivatives entity, and that's a valuable next part of the execution path, longer-term. It goes to the bank, but we've got a number of different execution paths, which is why there are solutions here that make it very manageable.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So no one would actually have to leave, right? You can accommodate any requirements?","Ruth Porat","Look, I think I would point to one other thing, which I commented on, which is, first and foremost, I don't want to prejudge the Moody's outcome, but a lot of clients are focused on what are the other ratings that we have for the firm. We're still A-rated by S&P and Fitch, and a lot of clients are doing their own credit assessment. Some of the questions that are coming up are more structure-related than anything else. And for that, we've focused in, I kind of gone through what are the execution options available.","James P. Gorman","And I think, Roger, just on ratings, it's important to note that when Moody's first came out to render their opinion on all of the banks around the world, it was before the stress test was -- the results of that were published, which is obviously important information. And it was before the first quarter results of the large institutions, certainly, in the U.S. So they now have the benefit of 2 concrete pieces of information that they didn't have. And I think it's important and constructive that they're delaying their readout on this until early June as they try to assimilate all of that positive feedback they've had from the industries.","Operator","The final question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","What are the investment banking backlogs? And how do they compare to a quarter ago?","Ruth Porat","The equity backlog remains strong and continues to build. And I feel like I've been saying that quarter after quarter and the appropriate question is, and what takes it to move out of backlog and into execution. We did see a bit more of that in March. There was some kind of a bit of a pickup in equity new issue product, and that gives us, I guess I would say guarded optimism that we'll see more of it here in the second quarter. Of course, the market backdrop always being one of the key determinants, but that remains an attractive pipeline. M&A is similarly a healthy backlog and we're having a lot of conversations with clients. I think the view continues to be that there is still CEO concern about the durability of the recovery, not just in the U.S., but around the globe. And therefore, we would be more guarded on the speed of movement of M&A deals out of the pipeline. We'd love to see that accelerate, clearly, but I think the view of our team has been for quite some time, if you look at historical patterns, it's more likely that it is a back half of the year rather than a front half, including second quarter movement out of the pipeline and onto announced transactions.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Can you put any dollar amounts? I mean, is it flat, is it up, is it down versus just last quarter?","Ruth Porat","We look at it kind of on a probability-weighted basis and it looks healthy. I think it's kind of generally around the same levels.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And is Facebook going to open up a lot more activity or is that a one-off? How do you think about that?","Ruth Porat","We never talk about any deals in registration. We don't want to [indiscernible] it.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Right. I just meant generally, do you think the technology IPOs are going to be picking up later this year?","Ruth Porat","Same answer.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Okay, that's fine. And then just switching gears, on the brokerage business, what were the net new assets for the quarter?","Ruth Porat","On the brokerage business, I'm glad you asked that because we have included in here fee-based assets. The net new assets were a bit below that, kind of consistent with the trend we saw last year. We have shifted the disclosure, as we talked about previously, to fee-based assets. And the reason for that is that's really strategically where we've been focused, and that is the stronger relationship between funds movement and our P&L is on the fee-based side. And so going forward, given that's the way the senior team is managing the business, we're going to be providing you with fee-based assets.","Celeste Brown","All right. Thank you so much for joining us today and we look forward to speaking to you in July.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call.

Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc","Kathleen McCabe - Head-Investor Relations","Good morning, this is Kathleen McCabe, Head of Investor Relations. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at www.morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.","Please refer to our notices regarding forward looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James Patrick Gorman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, everyone. Let me get straight into it. Obviously, 2016 got off to a difficult start. Markets were challenging, equity issuance was effectively non-existent, and retail activity was extremely subdued, reflecting the many uncertainties with which investors grappled. These included negative interest rates internationally, questions around the pace of Fed activity in the U.S., the growth rate of the Chinese economy, and growing concerns about geopolitical issues like the migration crisis and potential for Brexit, among others.","The securities businesses were exposed to a number of these factors, which led to a more challenging revenue environment than what we have come to expect in the first quarter of the year. That said all was not lost. M&A was robust, equities once again delivered a strong performance, and Wealth Management generated a pre-tax margin greater than 21% despite market headwinds and fewer trading days. We made real progress in our expense discipline ahead of our broader initiative called Project Streamline, which, as we said, will play out over the next two years.","So, where are we now? Though it's impossible to predict the future, we're seeing a slightly better turn in markets, certainly, in comparison to what was evident at the start of the first quarter, leading into the early days of February.","The M&A pipeline is strong and some green shoots suggest the equity underwriting calendar may open up. The S&P level at the end of the first quarter will help with asset pricing in our Wealth Management business, where we continue to grow our lending book and see flows into managed accounts. Importantly, fixed income, notwithstanding the 25% cut in head count, improved sequentially. By no means can FIC be considered strong, but the business is showing some resilience in this difficult environment.","In January we laid out our strategic goals for 2016 and 2017. While we have yet to see the revenue growth we anticipated, it remains early days. In a minute, Jon would take you through the progress we have made to date. It must be said that if these markets were to continue as is, our goals will be extremely difficult to achieve and we would therefore take additional appropriate actions. We obviously accept a degree of volatility in the revenue environment that has led to lower revenue pools, although, we do not expect this as a permanent state.","We also recognize that we cannot control the environment in which we operate, but we are focused on what we can control such as expenses. As part of Streamline, we are reshaping our expense base, and have embarked on an aggressive evaluation of our global infrastructure costs, reviewing each product, business and geography globally to convince ourselves that we need our footprint as it is currently configured.","We operate under a multitude of capitol tests and requirements. In January, we discussed our belief that we have sufficient capital for our business mix and risk profile and we're taking actions that should result in longer-term reduced capital requirements. For SLR and CET1, we are well in excess of the requirements in which we will be subject to in 2018 and 2019, respectively.","In terms of capital return, which has been one of the cornerstones of our strategic plan, our binding constraint is CCAR. To be clear, this is not a comment with respect to our capital return plans for this year, which we deem appropriate, but more for the following years. In order to drive capital returns to shareholders on a more substantial base than our current CCAR submission is asking for, we must continue to reduce those parts of our business that give rise to the high stress losses and capital deductions and\/or balance sheet usage. While in a difficult quarter, we still made $1 billion dollars, our ROE was 6%. This is not acceptable.","Finally, we received feedback last week on our resolution plan, which was deemed credible by the FDIC, but, on account of one deficiency, was deemed not credible by the Federal Reserve. As you saw, we received very detailed comments, and we're confident we'll be able to address the items that were raised.","We have dedicated significant resources and time to this important priority and will continue to work with our regulators to improve it. This management team would do what is necessary to ensure that we continue to progress against our strategic plan. I look forward to doing an update at the Morgan Stanley Financials Conference in June.","So, let me now turn it over to Jon to walk through the quarter in greater detail. Thank you.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, James. Good morning. As James said, the beginning of 2016 got off to a challenging start as negative sentiment and volatility prevailed in the global markets, undermining the traditional strength and client activity we have typically seen at the start of the year.","Concerns about global growth, China, commodities, and interest rates resulted in divergent performance of global indices and mixed results across international markets. Against this turbulent backdrop, we remain focused on delivering for our clients and helping them navigate these difficult markets. We continued to demonstrate strength in our equities and M&A businesses and stability in Wealth Management.","For the quarter, we reported revenues of $7.8 billion, essentially flat versus fourth quarter 2015 when excluding DVA for the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, we early adopted the accounting guidance that requires that DVA be presented in accumulated other comprehensive income as opposed to net revenues. Results for previous quarters shown in the supplement were not subject to restatement under the guidance. In my remarks, the prior period amounts exclude DVA.","Non-interest expense for the quarter were $6.1 billion dollars, comprised of $3.7 billion of compensation expense and $2.4 billion of non-compensation expenses. We remain focused on reducing expenses and, as James mentioned, Streamline initiatives have begun to take shape.","Some of the areas we are focused on in Streamline include: first, our workforce strategy. We continue to remix our global workforce and have approximately 40% of our infrastructure employees in our centers of excellence around the world. We are targeting to increase the number of employees deployed by 10% to 15%, and are actively working toward achieving this by year-end 2017.","Many of the initiatives involve leveraging best-in-class technologies. For instance, we are adopting virtualization and private cloud computing to increase agility and asset utilization, while achieving a significant reduction in our data center expenses. We are building the next-generation Wealth Management desktop and mobile suite for both our financial advisors and clients, while optimizing and automating our operations and work flow.","We're also partnering with incumbent technology companies and emerging startups on a number of initiatives to improve efficiency and lower costs. And lastly, we are focused on rationalizing our footprint and infrastructure to ensure we are as efficient and productive as possible. In particular, there are opportunities across our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management businesses where we have the ability to drive efficiencies while improving collaboration.","Turning to Institutional Securities, revenues were $3.7 billion, up 5% quarter on quarter. Non-compensation expenses were $1.4 billion for the quarter, down 13% versus the fourth quarter, driven by a decline in professional services. Compensation expenses were $1.4 billion, reflecting a 37% ISG compensation ratio.","In investment banking, we saw continued strength in our M&A business, offset by a tougher backdrop for our underwriting businesses. IPO volumes were down 82% quarter on quarter, and high-yield volumes were down off of already low levels in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, we generated $990 million in revenues, down 18% sequentially. Advisory revenues for the quarter were the strongest post-crisis at $591 million, up 15% as the deals announced last year continue to close.","Equity underwriting revenues were $160 million, down 55% versus 4Q, driven largely by the significant decreases in IPOs. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $239 million, down 31% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting a slowdown in high-yield and leveraged loan markets.","In equities, we saw continued leadership with revenues of $2.1 billion, up 13% sequentially. Prime brokerage revenues were higher this quarter as we work closely with our clients and continue to focus on the efficiency of our balance sheet and returns.","Derivatives revenues were up sequentially driven by increased client activities, as clients tried to navigate volatility and hedge risk exposures. And cash equity revenues were down versus 4Q against the backdrop of lower global equity markets and a limited new issue calendar. And we continue to show leadership in our electronic products suite.","Fixed Income & Commodities sales and trading revenues were $873 million, up 59% versus the fourth quarter, although, down 54% versus the first quarter of 2015 when we had a very strong commodities quarter, both in our Oil Merchanting business, which we sold in 4Q last year, and our commodities trading businesses.","Throughout the quarter, we saw a continuation of the challenges experienced in the second half of 2015. This translated into ongoing muted levels of client activity across our Fixed Income & Commodities business. Despite these headwinds and the 25% reduction in head count, we maintained our client focus and improved results from the fourth quarter.","We saw some improvement quarter-over-quarter in corporate credit with strength in investment grade, and we saw continued weakness across commodities. Fixed income RWAs were down $4 billion in the quarter to $132 billion. And our SLR balance sheet was down approximately $9 billion to $345 billion.","While revenues for the quarter were up sequentially, they are not where we ultimately want them to be. We're focused on driving execution and bringing our sales and trading businesses together to leverage synergies across the platform.","Other sales and trading revenues were down quarter-over-quarter, driven by hedging losses for our relationship lending book. Other revenues were down versus fourth quarter, driven by an increase in our allowance for loan losses for our held for investment portfolio.","In the quarter, we have continued to see pressure on the energy complex and have seen some credit migration and some bankruptcies. Our loan-loss provision on our HFI portfolio of $127 million this quarter was predominantly against our energy portfolio. As a reminder, 40% of our approximately $15 billion funded and unfunded energy exposure is fair value or held for sale, where we mark-to-market daily and have taken markdowns this quarter.","Our energy exposure is down about $1 billion dollars from last quarter. And importantly, we have not seen any meaningful signs of contagion. Lastly, average trading VaR for the fourth quarter was flat versus last quarter at $46 million.","Wealth Management revenues for the first quarter were $3.7 billion, down 2% versus the fourth quarter, reflecting muted client activity in an unfavorable market environment as well as fewer trading days. Our PBT margin for the quarter was 21.4%, up slightly versus 4Q15, reflecting the stability of the business. Bright spots for the quarter were continued momentum in our lending strategy and the ongoing secular trends to manage accounts. Flows for the quarter were approximately $6 billion with decent pickup in March.","The NII story continues with net interest income up 7% sequentially and 21% year-over-year, driven by solid loan growth. Funded lending balances in Wealth Management grew approximately $2 billion or 5% during the quarter and $12 billion or 30% year-over-year. Credit metrics remain strong with an average FICO score of greater than 750 for our mortgage borrowers.","Transactional activity was particularly weak as clients remained on the sidelines due to market volatility and a lack of new issues. The first quarter for commission revenues were the lowest we have seen in the last five years, reflecting the very cautious attitude of investors in this highly uncertain environment. As global and domestic uncertainties abate, we would expect a return to a more normal level of activity.","On the expense side, compensation was down 3% quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower deferred compensation plans returns. Non-compensation expenses were down 5% versus fourth quarter, driven by seasonally lower expenses in marketing and business development. Deposits in our bank deposit program were $152 billion in the first quarter, up $3 billion versus the fourth quarter, though lower than the quarter's peak, reflecting some improvement in client activities as market conditions have improved.","In Investment Management, revenues were $477 million, down 23% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues from asset management fees for the quarter were $526 million, up 5% versus 4Q, reflecting the steadiness of this revenue line, and AUM was essentially unchanged at $405 billion. Investment revenues in the quarter were a loss of $64 million, driven by volatility and particular weakness in emerging market investments, resulting in mark-downs and some reversal of carry. Overall, expenses were down 13% quarter-over-quarter, driven by compensation, which was down 23%.","Turning to the balance sheet, total assets were $808 billion at March 31, up from the $787 billion at December 31. The increase reflects a low fourth quarter spot asset level given lower client activity at the end of the year as well as higher levels of liquidity in the first quarter. Our average balance sheet, however, was down to $802 billion in the quarter from $814 billion in 4Q.","Pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $386 billion, down from $395 billion in the fourth quarter. Our pro forma fully phased in Basal III advanced Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 14.5%. Our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio for the quarter was 6%, up from 5.8% in Q4.","During the first quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock, or approximately 25 million shares, and our board declared a $0.15 dividend per share. Lastly, in the quarter, as you will see in our supplement, we modified our segment common equity allocation disclosure to base it on fully phased in regulatory capital, as the market has focused more on these ratios than the transitional ratios.","As we've said in the past, we look at capital through multiple lenses, so this is not a totally new view for us. Capital is allocated based on risk-based and leverage-based requirements under both business-as-usual as well as stress scenarios. This resulted in a reduction in parent equity from $21 billion to $6 billion, and the resulting $15 billion is allocated across the segments. We will now allocate equity to our segments only at the beginning of the year, and it will remain fixed throughout the year.","Turning to the outlook, across sales and trading, we do not believe that the backdrop we saw in the first quarter will become a permanent state and have already seen some improvement in market conditions. However, given the numerous uncertainties across regions, we would expect to see some uneven markets and client activity. We are engaged with our clients and focused on delivering content, liquidity and solutions.","In banking, M&A pipelines are healthy and client dialogs remain strong, but we would expect a slowdown from last year's elevated pace. We are cautiously optimistic that equity underwriting volumes will improve after a very muted first quarter, probably more weighted to the second half. We have seen IPOs in the U.S. and EMEA starting to come to market. How these transactions are received will be important to confidence going forward.","In debt underwriting, we would expect the investment grade markets to remain stable and are seeing signs of life in the non-investment grade markets, although still selective at the bottom of the capital structure. In Wealth Management, we would expect to see the stability and trends seen in the last several quarters to continue. And in Investment Management, we expect the asset management fees to remain stable and expect potential lumpiness in the investments line. We will continue to focus on Project Streamline and managing our risk profile.","With that, we will open up the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. James, maybe first one for you and this is based off of the strategic update that you provided last quarter, just on the ROE target. Just wanted to get a sense, when you think of \u2013 in that situation, I think revenues were up maybe low-single digits; a lot of that being driven by the Wealth Management segment. And then, in this environment, obviously, the whole industry has some weakness and revenues are down 20% for you guys. So when we think about those targets in that revenue range of up low-single digits to down 20%, how much of the cost structure can be managed, particularly, if we're not \u2013 obviously, not down 20%, but even if we're plus or minus 5% on the revenue base, is that still an environment where, by the end of 2017, the targets are still attainable?","James Patrick Gorman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Mike. I think, first of all, the targets are, as you point out, 2017 targets, and they did have in them \u2013 they were driven in part by three efforts. One was Project Streamline and the ability to take out $1 billion dollars of compensation, non-compensation expenses, assuming a flat revenue environment. The second was modest revenue growth of 3% to 5%; and then, of course, continuance of our capital plans.","I think it's \u2013 I know we're going to get a lot of calls on this, because that's the perils of putting out a target is you get asked about it every time, every quarter until you finally get there. But we did put it out for 2017, so I think it's very early days here. This was an \u2013 as we said, an unusual backdrop. I think everybody would acknowledge the calendar was very weak. As we said, retail investors were very skittish. We still had some cleanup in the Investment Management area. So it was an unusual backdrop.","So, we're not really at the stage of second guessing those targets at this point. What I was trying to make clear in my opening comments that we're definitely not standing still. If indeed the environment continued as is, we would be much more aggressive on the cost front. That's our job, and we intend to do it. I'm not about to project what that means in terms of targets. We're standing by our 9% to 11% by the end of 2017. And let's see how this plays out over a couple of quarters. But we're very focused on this.","We think this business mix is attractive against those kinds of targets. We have no problem with that. We think we're in a position where over time we're going to be doing increasing capital distributions. We believe that the markets are unlikely to be at the level that we were at in the first quarter, but, again, we have to deal with reality. If it turns out that is the case, we'll react accordingly.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And then, just as a follow up, maybe on the Wealth Management business. You're still \u2013 pretty good trends for what you guys can control. Just given that we have got the final Department of Labor fiduciary role, just wanted to get your sense on \u2013 as we have to implement that, some of the either pressures the business, how much from a cost structure has already been put into the budget, and so from a pre-tax margin standpoint, any really change on that? And just your view overall on how to manage that business with the new rule.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Mike. It's Jon. We're still digesting sort of all the nitty-gritty of the final rule, but I think, as we've said in the past, we had been preparing for this eventuality for a while now, and we've been investing for this eventuality. And when we put out our 23% to 25% margin target for next year, we had this in mind. As we said, we have the largest advisory platform in the industry, as well as significant investments in our digital platform. So we think that we're well positioned here. We're going to work with our clients to provide solution to their investment needs, and I think, by the end of the day, overall impact to both our clients and our financial results are very manageable.","James Patrick Gorman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd just add one thing to that. The DoL ruling, obviously, it's good to have it in writing, so we know what we're dealing with. And, frankly, given the annuitization focus of the business that's sort of consistent with where we as a firm have been going. But it's one of many things that are going on in that business. And I would \u2013 as Jon said, I would pay attention to many of the things, including the growth in the bank, the expense savings, the digital strategy that we're putting in place. There are a lot of things going on that we'll be updating over the next 12 months. This was an important one, but it's not the be-all and the end-all.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just another one here on GWM and, really, just thinking about the contribution of kind of managed accounts relative to the existing business, and is that shift , is that accretive or dilutive to profitability in the segment? And then, I guess, you just alluded to this, but with bringing on some executives with digital expertise, how should we think about the role of robo advice tools within your broader set of services to clients?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, a couple of questions there. I think in terms of the trends in the business, again, we've been very pleased with the stability of this business. We've been investing in this business for a while. We've been yielding the synergies of bringing the two platforms together, bringing the teams together, and the results have been reasonably stable in what is a difficult backdrop.","The digital platform is a really exciting opportunity for us. We've talked about a couple of things as being sort of secular trends. The role of managed account and people wanting advice for their balances is something that we can continue and was one of the premises for the merger of Smith Barney in the first place and we saw that continue.","We've got about $800 billion in managed accounts now, about 40% of our assets, and we think we can continue to grow that. And so that is a very important part of the strategy, and I think the digital strategy is just going to help provide our clients with the types of services they need. We have over 2.5 million households. Many of our clients like to interface with their advisors on the phone; some like to come in; some like to use technology. So making sure we have good products and services across that full spectrum is going to be important and I think the recent hire that we made on our digital strategy to lead that in Wealth Management is really going to yield some interesting innovations going forward.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then, with respect to trading, particularly in FIC, it sounds like the quarter ended on a better note, so can you just maybe help us think about that as it carry into April and is it \u2013 across businesses and really within credit specifically, it seems like that was one area that was a little bit of a headwind, so how are markets there and how's activity started this quarter?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, in terms of the FIC performance in terms of the different items, I highlighted some pickup in credit. I would say, as you know, we're more oriented towards the credit products, and we saw some modest improvement in those areas, but still a difficult backdrop and challenging environment for those products, so they're still below where we would like to see them and below their historical levels.","On the macro side, our rates business held in okay. FX was clearly slower, given our footprint as well as sort of the more muted volatility that we saw in the FX rates this quarter. But, all in all, again, it was a decent quarter for us in light of the backdrop and in light of our business mix. We did see a pickup towards the end of March that sort of followed through a little bit here in the first couple of weeks of April, although, obviously, the events over the weekend and what we've seen in Asia and some of the commodities is just a stark reminder that we're going to continue to see periods of volatility here.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess, just on that note, the fair mark \u2013 fair value mark within the energy book, did you disclose that?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. No, we did not.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Can you provide any additional color on that?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, from an energy perspective what I would say is that 40% is both fair value and held for sale, the held for sale marks you'll see run through other revenues. The fair value will run through the sales and trading line items, and we mark to mark that daily.","Devin P. Ryan - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks for taking all my questions.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","James Patrick Gorman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just following up on fixed income to start here. Obviously, a lot of moving pieces with a weak macro, restructuring that you're doing, but as you think about kind of more of a steady state or a typical first quarter, and I can appreciate it's very hard to frame, but are you thinking leverage of kind of 50% higher from where we are here or how are you right-sizing the cost base? What revenue environment are you thinking the business is capable of generating?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Let me try to tackle that. There were a couple of different components there. But let's \u2013 first of all, let's put it into context when we look at the first quarter of 2015 versus the first quarter of this year. I said back in March that wasn't a good starting point for comparison for a couple of reasons.","First of all, if you recall last year, we benefited from the extreme weather in the first quarter. Not only was that from our physical oil business, but we saw significantly higher levels of client activity. Since also the first quarter of last year, we continue to restructure and reshape this business both in terms of its footprint and capital intensity. We've sold the Oil Merchanting business. In the first quarter or at the end of last year, we had about $190 billion of RWA dedicated to the business and, today, that number is closer to $130 billion.","More recently, we changed the leadership, and then in December we took out 25% of the head count. So this is a different model \u2013 excuse me, a different business. It's got less capital, it's more focused, and in short, we're undertaking a major restructuring. It's against a difficult backdrop. The backdrop has been more negative against our more credit-oriented businesses. And we had a decent quarter. I wouldn't say it was a great quarter, but it was certainly decent, and we want to build on the early progress that we've seen here.","We don't expect to see the types of quarters that we saw in the first quarter of 2015, but we are focused on doing better and getting more consistent results. You asked about profitability levels. I think, in January, when we rolled out the strategy, we said we wanted a credible and critical fixed income business. We were going to take capital out. We were going to take cost out. We were going to try to maintain the revenue footprint and, therefore, it was obviously going to improve the overall profitability of the business.","The last couple of years, we've generated somewhere in the order of $4.2 billion or $4.3 billion of revenue. We're trying to maintain that revenue base. The first quarter is slightly below that run rate, but it's a, again, decent result. And we're still focused on trying to maintain that revenue footprint.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just separately, the non-comp cost came down nicely both linked-quarter and year-over-year. I think there's still quite a bit of benefit to come from your initiatives there. But just walk us through how we think about the trajectory both maybe heading into 2Q and 3Q, and then I think most of the savings you talked about hitting next year and just reiterate that that's still the case.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. No, I think that's the right way to think about it. Some of the comments I mentioned about the initiatives underway are really going to take \u2013 those things take time to evolve into the cost savings. We're making good progress. And, as I mentioned before, the Streamline initiatives, many of them will hit towards the back half of this year and next year. But the progress that we've made to date is just a maniacal focus on making sure we control our discretionary spend and we're being very prudent here.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. Your line is open.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for the reallocation disclosure on the \u2013 on the fully phased capital. That's helpful to understand what the real capital usage of the different business lines is. I guess my question on the back of that though is there any change to the expectation that FIC, as a result of the strategic actions that you took late last year, that it could free up more than $5 billion to $8 billion in capital over time? Now, that we see $43 billion in ISG capital, the $5 billion to $8 billion free-up given how much of that $43 billion we know must belong to FIC seems like it's not actually that much.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Listen, I think that the plan that we laid out in January in terms of the actions around the balance sheet and SLR footprint leads to about $5 billion to $8 billion of freed-up capital. We said in the past that we might reinvest some of that back into other ISG businesses, so that line item might not move as people would expect, but, again, we're going to evaluate all of our businesses and all of our assets and investments to see if we can be more capital efficient. Right now, we think that $5 billion to $8 billion is the right number.","James Patrick Gorman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd just add, Guy, the real game in town relating to capital is CCAR and we're approaching \u2013 I think we're approaching a point in time when the basic architecture of the CCAR model will be in place. That doesn't mean that the actual scenarios won't change year to year, of course, they're going to change year to year, but the architecture will be in place.","By that I mean, I think next year we'll see the G-SIB buffer put into CCAR, and when that is put in, there are likely to be various other changes, as I understand it, to the CCAR model, which would net against the G-SIB buffer. Once we have all of that under the four ratios in CCAR and each of them over their nine quarters, we'll have a much better sense of what our true capital buffer is.","So, at the moment, we're sailing a little bit blind. The numbers we have laid out is what we see as sort of visible buffer right now. But our hope is that, over time \u2013 this is not the final end state for us in terms of excess capital. We think over time that we will have more excess capital than that, but to get there, we need to do it within the confines of what the CCAR stress tests are demanding. And as we get the final \u2013 what I think is likely to be the final architecture of CCAR next year \u2013 again, not the final models, but the final architecture, we will be able to adjust our business models accordingly.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP","That's fair and helpful in terms of how you're thinking about it. Thanks. Maybe a follow-up on that is as the fixed income business continues to evolve, it would seem that it is going to evolve to be more of a digital market business with probably less of a human, but also probably over time still less of an economic capital footprint associated with it. Is that fair? And could you talk about your vision for fixed income now that Ted has been overseeing it for a long enough time to maybe start to think about how it becomes more digital?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure, Guy. We do think that there are some trends in the fixed income business that will lead themselves to more electronification. We've talked about certain areas of FX and other places. As you know, we have true leadership in our electronic product suite in equities, and we're going to use some of that learning to see if we can migrate that into the fixed income area; but we do see further electronification. The speed in which that happens is obviously going to be determined over time, and we do think we are well-positioned given our leadership that we've shown in digital and electronic products in the past.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks. That's all helpful. And then just one final question, which is more on the current credit environment in energy and materials and mining. Can you give us a sense for what your loan loss reserve as a percent of exposure is for the banking book portion of those exposures?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, what I would say, Guy, is, as you know, not all of our portfolio is held for investment. A good chunk, 40%, is fair value and held for sale, which gets marked daily. I said in March at the conference that I was generally more concerned about the global macro backdrop and what that does to the trading environment, and what that means for our client activity than our energy exposure.","So, I think we're going to continue to manage it tightly. We're trying to reduce it where we can. We've brought it down $1 billion dollars quarter-over-quarter. We continue to hedge as appropriate. We have seen the weakness. We would expect that would continue a bit, but, again, we're going to continue to manage it tightly.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A quick follow-up, Jon, the comment on maintaining the previous $4.2 billion revenue footprint. You gave some helpful color there on the difficult environment and how you view the results, but maybe can you help us frame how to think about physical commodities going away? You've indicated how that reduces the seasonality of FIC, but is there a way to sort of frame out how much of that revenue left with the sale closing, so we can think about the right jumping-off point?","And then, to follow up on the comments about the revenue environment adjustments versus \u2013 and cutting costs further, has the improvement in March and April been enough for you to say that maybe you don't need to relook, or does that commentary include the improvement in March and April?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So, I would say a few things. One, we are \u2013 the revenue target or \u2013 is a goal, the run rate in the first quarter is slightly below that level. I think the fact that we no longer have the physical oil business should reduce the seasonality that we saw in this business, clearly, but also many of the changes that we've made are going to try to hopefully improve the consistency of this business. So, we would expect more quarters to look similar than the volatility that we've seen in the past, is the first comment.","Secondly, I do think that we obviously saw a pickup in March and the signs of early April. We think we can improve our results. They are still below sort of what we've seen historically, run rate, in some of our stronger product areas. And we expect to improve our revenue results from this quarter. So, again, this is one quarter's results. This quarter is a decent starting point, because we didn't have the physical oil business in it, but we obviously had a difficult macro backdrop. But these numbers are probably more reflective of the opportunity going forward than the first quarter of 2015. And this is a multi-year process; we're not going to see all of the changes in just one quarter.","James Patrick Gorman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd just add a couple of points to that. Firstly, as it relates to commodities, a lot of focus on the revenue delta year-over-year, which I understand there was a cold snap last January that obviously flatted the commodities numbers there. And, obviously, not having the business had a reasonably material impact on the revenues, but the broader picture is strategically what we're trying to do. There is a reason that one of the regulators determined that we had a credible plan and the other found only one deficiency; and part of it is because we have simplified our business model.","There's a reason that we're confident about Project Streamline, and part of it is because we have fewer businesses, less infrastructure, less legal entities; and what we did with commodities and then selling the physical oil business, all gets at that simplification. It reduces RWAs, it reduces capital, it reduces risk, audit, compliance, legal, finance, oversight of that part of the business, and it's all about simplifying Morgan Stanley and making it a better understandable business from a regulatory perspective and from an investor perspective. Nothing that happened in the first quarter changes that view.","On the expense side, yeah, we've been grinding away at our non-comp expenses for a while. We've had some major headwinds with legal expenses, both with litigation and with the cost of lawyers in defending these various claims. We're clearly making progress on that. We have been focused, as Jon used the word maniacally, I think that's fair on our non-comp expenses. That is completely separate from Project Streamline.","Project Streamline is a major firm-wide initiative to figure out the most efficient way to run our infrastructure with the most efficient footprint. So, those two things will go unabated irrespective of whether the second quarter is strong or weak, whether first quarter was strong or weak. They are things which we have clearly on plan. We need to get the ROE of this business up, and one of the ways we're going to do that is being much more efficient in our expense management.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. Thanks for all that color. And then, thinking about the loan book here, you all saw NII grow faster than loans here this quarter in Wealth Management. And so, it's right to think about the pickup in LIBOR probably benefiting the PLA portion of that loan book, right? Just the mechanics of that are the right way \u2013 just want to verify that the mechanics of that are the right way to think about it.","And then, thinking about the provision side of things, on the institutional side, just in the HFI piece, I think, provision was up around 200% versus last quarter. So that's just on HFI, not that 40% you were talking about before, right, Jon? And how should we think about that in a world where oil stays at about $30 a barrel?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Let's do loans first. As we've said in the past, we're excited about the bank strategy, what we call our deposit deployment strategy, taking our lower yielding cost \u2013 lower yielding securities and converting them into loans. We've seen good progress. You mentioned LIBOR, I think we're more sensitive to the Fed funds rate. We've seen a little bit of pick-up, obviously, given what happened in December. But I think the real growth in NII for us within the Wealth Management business is going to come from the fact that we expect the average earning assets to grow probably by \u2013 in the bank to grow probably by $10 billion to $15 billion this year.","You saw some of the balances in the wealth business; it was up dramatically over last year's period. So, the key driver to NII growth in the bank, which a good portion of that flows through Wealth Management, is we're going to have more average earning assets grow, yielding somewhere in this 2% range. So that's the driver to that and I would pay closer attention to Fed funds into LIBOR. And the second question was...","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","The provision for the held to investment.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh, provision. So, the $127 million provision is for the totality of the firm. Some of that, as I said, the predominance was towards our energy portfolio. A small piece of that goes against our Wealth Management business, and then for our unfunded commitments, it's actually part of the expense line. But that $127 million was for the total firm, not just for ISG and energy.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, sorry. I was talking actually about the ISG piece. I think you say in the footnote that it's $108.7 million this quarter versus $37 million, that was...","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, no, that's right. And, again, the vast majority of that is to the energy portfolio.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And any color if oil stays low? Outlook?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Nothing different than what we've said in the past. We're very focused on it. We clearly would expect continued weakness and we're monitoring it very closely.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi, the new CEO letter talks about progress with the business mix, banking equities and other areas, but the ROE, as you pointed out, was only 6% in the first quarter. And the ROE has been below the cost of capital for the last decade. And the market further expects you to miss your 2017 ROE target of 9% based on consensus earnings forecast. I might add based on a stock price below tangible book value. So the question is, do you think that you can still meet your 2017 ROE target of 9% and why?","And from my standpoint, there's three big levers. One would be expenses, which you've highlighted and you said (47:00) you could take more actions. Two would be markets getting better and you see early signs. But the third lever would be capital returns. And so, how soon can investors see some of that freed-up FIC capital? You had 5% annualized buybacks this quarter, which is decent, but you also mentioned on the call now that you can reduce the impact of businesses with high stress losses. What are those businesses, can you get rid of them and how big are those?","James Patrick Gorman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Mike. Nice to hear from you again. As you have, I think, pretty consistently been asking this management team to put a timeframe on our ROE goals and we did it in January. So in April, we're unlikely to back off of those goals, as I said, I think, to the first question, which might have been from Mike Carrier, I think, when he asked about it. We stand by those goals. But, as I said, and they weren't caveats, they were just reality, they implied that we hit our expense targets on a flat revenue environment, that our total revenues grew somewhere between 3% and 5%, and that we did the right thing around right-sizing our fixed income business and freeing up the right capital.","As I think you said, we feel pretty good, honestly, about the expense targets. We made some really good progress against non-comp expenses and maintained comp discipline before we really got into the meat of Project Streamline. So, I'd put a check against sort of early indicator on that one. On the revenue growth, clearly, we didn't have revenue growth. So that would be a negative at this point, one quarter into the program. But, clearly, things brighten up a little bit towards the end of the quarter.","Not going to get into the business of trying to predict stuff, but we would be surprised and, probably, you would be and most of the people on this call if this environment stayed as is for the next two years. And hopefully, I was very clear that if it does, we will continue to take significant action. We're not going to stand and just watch it. And on the capital plan, we've just put in our CCAR submission. We had the G-SIB buffer coming in the next year's capital plan. Our CET1 fully phased in ratio, I think, is 14.5%, 14.6%. Our supplemental leverage ratio was 6%. A couple of years ago, the supplemental leverage was 4.2%. I think our CET1 fully phased in is probably in the top 2 or top 3 of the global 15 or 17 banks. So we feel pretty very good about our capital ratios.","What we need to understand is how we come through CCAR. The stability of the scenario, obviously, changes every year depending upon economic conditions like interest rates and market shocks and the like. And as we see how the CCAR deals with certain parts of our business and the stress losses that are implied by that, we will adjust those businesses as necessary. It's too early to lay out what that might be, because we haven't seen the results of it yet. But my main message to you and to our shareholders is that when we put out the 9% to 11%, again, subject to the revenue growth I talked about, which was modest, but was real, certainly, not subject to negative revenue growth. We did it with a pretty well thought through plan that's been building.","And I'm the first to acknowledge that we haven't hit our cost of capital for the last several years. I think, without being defensive about it, it's fair to say I'm not sure very many banks have. And I'm not sure that the denominator of what you're required to holding capital has been a standing ball, in fact, it's been a bouncing ball, but it's gone up every year. So, listen, we're making steady progress, we're committed to our goals, we'll continue pushing on expenses, we'll do what we can to free up excess capital, and we believe the environment is likely to improve from where we saw the bottoms of the first quarter. More than that, I think, it's too early to predict.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Thank you.","James Patrick Gorman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","Thank you. On the reallocation of capital, I'm curious on what brought that on, your own doing or conversations with the regulators? And then, focusing specifically on Wealth Management, to go from a 19% down to a 13%, I'm curious on how much growth is built into that, given that you're reallocating once a year, meaning your loans grew 30% and deposits are growing significantly. How much growth is built in there? Because I'm assuming you feel like Wealth Management should be better than a 13% ROE business.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, on your first question, in terms of, as you know, since taking over, I've been talking about \u2013 we look at multiple lenses of capital. So we've been analyzing and looking at our businesses under multiple frames for a while. As you notice from my prepared remarks and James' prepared remarks, we always keep referencing now fully phased in.","It seems like the market is not interested in what the actual transitional ratios are and they're more focused on fully phased in. And so, at the end of the year, we thought it was the right time as we start 2016 from a disclosure standpoint to put in the fully phased in ratio numbers.","In terms of the second question, I actually \u2013 my supplement doesn't have it. Can I just \u2013 I'm looking for the page. There we go. My supplement is missing page 12, Glenn. Here we you go. So in the first quarter of 2015, you saw the 19% Wealth Management ratio, I think the better comparison, the change in any capital allocation, if you look at the middle two columns, the business went from 14% to 12%. You saw that the revenues were slightly off this quarter and so we \u2013 the PBG was down. Part of our Wealth Management business, as you properly point out, is a lending business, and so when we move to the fully phased in ratios, we allocated more capital to that business, as it continues to grow in that high quality lending book.","The ROE for this quarter was slightly improved to 13%. We think that business can be better than the 13% ratio that we're showing, particularly, if we see some better signs in the transactional and the transactional activity. So we think we can build from 13%, but this business does require capital given our lending focus.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","Understood. And then, I forget, I'm not sure you broke out the actual, either accrual reversals or marks in Investment Management for the private equity and real estate funds, but just curious what you could tell us about the book and if all the prior accruals have been now reversed out?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I didn't comment on that. So the investments line, which, as we've talked about in the past, has been lumpy, and it's really a function of the overall investment environment. That line represents not only the performance-based fees that we receive, but also reflects our investments in these funds. That number over the last 24, 25 quarters has really averaged about a little over $100 million a quarter. It's been negative less than a handful of times. This quarter, it was negative. It was negative 64 million. About a third \u2013 little less than a third of that, Glenn, was from reversal of carry. The rest was from investment markdowns.","And then, in terms of what we have left, as we've said in prior quarters, we have written a significant portion of our carry related to our Asia funds down at this point. But, going forward, we still have carry, really mostly in our infrastructure and real estate funds, and we'll disclose the cumulative amount of that carry in our quarter \u2013 excuse me \u2013 in our Q, and you'll see that it has gone down this quarter.","Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks very much, Jon.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Your line is open.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So wanted to dig in, Jon, into the capital allocation disclosure for a moment. And one of the questions we're getting quite a bit is how we should reconcile the revised fully phased in capital allocations that you have with essentially a CCAR required or spot required capital target; potentially, the minimum level of capital you'll need for CCAR to get through the test unscathed while also supporting higher payouts.","And the back-of-the envelope math suggests that, when we exclude the unallocated portion and goodwill and intangibles, you're allocating $52 billion across your businesses and as a percentage of risk-weighted assets, it's about a 13% target, so a little bit higher than what we were contemplating previously. And I just wanted to get a sense as to whether 13% core Tier 1 is a reasonable long-term target based on the current mix? And should we expect this to come down or how should we expect it to traject as FIC mitigation efforts take hold?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, I think I followed your math. I don't think that 13% number, that's not \u2013 I wouldn't make that conclusion. As James mentioned, CCAR is the binding constraint to capital return. Our capital allocation model is not a proxy, if you will, for the CCAR model, because the model, as James said, or the infrastructure is changing and the variables change year-over-year. But we will continue to manage our capital efficiency and see if we can take more capital out of the businesses and return it to shareholders.","What our absolute level of \u2013 our spot capital ratios won't be the ultimate determinant of how much capital we can return, but, actually, the Fed's stress test in their severely adverse case will be the driving force about how much capital we can return. And that number is going to change as the test evolves.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. So, how much capital you need under CCAR is not explicitly contemplated, then, under these revised capital allocations that you've disclosed?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thank you for clarifying that. And just one more question. As it relates to your G-SIB scores, clearly you've made significant progress in reducing your RWAs. And some of your peers have noted they've moved into lower buckets. And I was wondering whether you could disclose where you believe your surcharges stand today under both method 1 and method 2?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think what we've said is that the G-SIB buffer for this year for us is 3%.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","And do you see room for you to move into a lower bucket, just given some of the actions that you're taking on the FIC side?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think \u2013 we obviously monitor that very closely, and if there's an opportunity to move to a lower bucket, we will clearly be focused on trying to do that, and what the trade-offs are between revenues and profitability; but we clearly monitor that. But, at this point, we're in the 3% bucket.","Steven J. Chubak - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","That's it for me. Thanks for taking my questions.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Your line is open.","Fiona M. Swaffield - RBC Europe Ltd. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two questions. One was there was a recent Basel paper on revisions to the Basel III leverage framework. But I think in the past you've talked about the standardized counterparty credit risk impact. I wondered if you had any comments on whether that paper would make a big difference to your SLR. And the second issue is just on fixed income. You mentioned $132 billion, I think, of RWAs, so you're making significant progress. Do you think it's likely you could reach the $120 billion earlier than 2017? Is it that you're having success in the runoff of legacy assets? Thanks.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So I think the first question relates to the SACR (1:00:00) proposal. To be honest, I have reviewed it. I haven't spent a lot of time on it. And the first read is it could be beneficial to SLR ratio, but I don't think we have a quantification of that just yet. And then, on the second question, which was \u2013 I'm sorry, Fiona, one more time?","Fiona M. Swaffield - RBC Europe Ltd. (Broker)","It was on the fixed income RWAs. I think you mentioned $132 billion.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh, yeah, listen, yeah, we continue to make progress. We're very focused on it. The goals we laid out were for 2017 and beyond. If we can get there quicker, we will. But also recognize that that number might bounce around a bit based on client activity, but we're pretty happy with the progress we've made.","Fiona M. Swaffield - RBC Europe Ltd. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. So a couple of clean up (1:00:54) questions in the Wealth Management business. I guess commissions were down 18% year-over-year, you mentioned reduced retail risk appetite. Just curious if the Department of Labor rule had any impact on advisor behavior that affected that number. And then, secondly, just longer term, if you're moving towards fee-based assets, just curious how that squares with your comment that you expect commissions to bounce back over time.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the first I would say, no. And on the second, I think the migration to managed accounts will have an impact on the transactional accounts, but these levels are really beyond the shift from transactional to managed money. So I think we can see a rebound from where we are today.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Fair. And then, on the comp ratio in GWM, you called out fair value and deferred comp in the release having an impact on the comp ratio; would be helpful if you could quantify that for us, just so we have a good jump-off point for next quarter.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We'll look at it for future disclosures, but we don't disclose that number.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And just lastly, more of a bigger picture question. I guess really nice margin expansion in Wealth Management, but organic growth just remains poor or weak, whether measured by fee-based flows or financial advisor head count. I'm just curious if you think organic growth is necessary for the long-term health of this business?","James Patrick Gorman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Why don't I give Jon a break for a minute? And, by the way, we have extended this call for about \u2013 we're going to extend it about ten minutes past the time. We're trying to give everybody a chance to get their questions in, so we'll be brief. As long as there is inflation of financial assets and as long as there is population growth, and as long as the business model remains relevant to wealthy investors, that business will continue to grow; in addition to the fact, obviously, we're putting more product through the pipeline by putting more banking and lending products through. So, yes.","Christian Bolu - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you for squeezing me in.","James Patrick Gorman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. I just want to understand, specifically within FIC as it relates to your broader guidance, would the business have been profitable at the current run rate of revenues given the expense reduction? And at the projected level of capital extraction, would it achieve the 9% to 11% ROE targets?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, the ROE targets are for the firm \u2013 for all of our capital and, as we've mentioned in the past, we are clearly trying to drive improved profitability in that business by maintaining the revenues, reducing the capital and reducing the costs.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","But in terms of sort of the level of run rate revenues to achieve profitability, was that accomplished?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We laid out a plan just this past January that said we were going to try to maintain the revenue footprint that we've seen in the past, reduce the capital intensity and reduce the costs. So we're looking to improve the velocity and the consistency of those results.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. First, a quick one. Jon, at what point this quarter, if at all, did you all think about utilizing the de minimis exception to potentially increase your buybacks this quarter since they've been pretty steady at the $625 million level over the course of this current CCAR cycle?","James Patrick Gorman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We didn't. We chose not to exercise it, because we're more focused on the annual CCAR cycle. The first time we exercised it was the first time we put our toe in the water to do a capital buyback several years ago. Obviously, we reserve the right at any point in the future, but this time we were focused on getting the CCAR plan in.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, makes sense. And then, secondarily, quickly, in terms of the somewhat lower revenue run rate in terms of the \u2013 within Wealth Management for the revenues per FA, those have been running at around $920 million a quarter. If that level stays and you don't really get much of a bounce back, does that imply much meaningful reduction in terms of head count in that business as well?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, that's just a function of sort of the client assets are down given the volatility in the market. The number of FAs is pretty stable. We've been investing in that business and recruiting. We would like to continue to keep that business at roughly that size, and that's just a numerator-denominator dynamic.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Jon, maybe just a quick follow-up on energy, can you give us the details on what's funded, unfunded, what's non-investment grade or anything else? I think last quarter you also discussed what the E&P exposure was, can you give us some of those more details?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll try to do this very quickly in the interest of time. So, the $14.8 billion in total funded and unfunded, the numbers haven't changed dramatically, 60% investment grade, about 30% drawn, E&P, same thing, about $4.1 billion, about $1.8 billion drawn. Mostly \u2013 virtually all to non-investment grade, and then the $2.3 billion of undrawn is predominantly to investment grade.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. That's all I have got. Thanks.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc","Quick question on the cost side. Your comp level in the IB has been quite well managed, year-on-year down 32%. Just wondering if you could discuss a little bit how it relates to the sale of the business, deferred reduction exit or comp reduction \u2013 real comp reduction and the streamlining business or streamlining operation. Just trying to understand better how we should think about the run rate of the cost line with this Streamline Project coming on.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, I think we made nice progress here early. The Streamline initiatives are really sort of towards the back-end of this year and next year, because they're more structural and fundamental in nature. That's how I'd try to address that.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc","So it's all related to the commodity exit part then?","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, no. I'm sorry. No. It's definitely not related to the commodity. This is broad-based savings across the businesses and this initiative is firm-wide.","Kian Abouhossein - JPMorgan Securities Plc","Okay. Thanks.","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you very much.","Kathleen McCabe - Head-Investor Relations","With that, I think we will wrap up our call.

This presentation may also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings at morganstanley.com for a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley. This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman, who will speak to the slides available on our website and filed with our current report on Form 8-K this morning.","James P. Gorman","Good morning, and thank you, Celeste. As we close the door on 2012 and open one on 2013, I want to share my thoughts with you on the state of Morgan Stanley and where we're headed. To do so, we're going to have a different kind of earnings call. I'll give you a strategic update, and we'll have a dozen or so slides, which we've prepared for you to follow along with, and they're on the website, as Celeste said. Then Ruth is going to take you through the normal quarterly review, and we'll both take questions at the end.","Why are we doing it this way today? It's because we believe Morgan Stanley is at a turning point. Importantly, we see a clear path to meeting and then exceeding our cost of equity, and we want to lay it out for you.","While we live in a world of continued regulatory uncertainty as we wait final rules on derivatives reform, Volcker and resolution authority, which will bring significant changes to the markets, we are controlling what we can control. We have strong and leading capital ratios, we have a clear path for wealth management and we're being aggressive with our cost base. We have reduced fixed income risk-weighted assets even faster than we had initially planned and have a clear path to what we consider to be the end state in that business.","We've been carefully trying to balance being aggressive where we can, and you can see this in our expense cuts and RWA reductions, but not making decisions that might seem wise in the very short term but may in fact be harmful to medium- and long-term shareholder value. I will outline the 5 strategic initiatives that led us to meeting and -- that will lead us to meeting and achieving our cost of capital. And again, you can follow along with the available slides.","Let me go into greater detail on what we're doing to drive higher returns. First, wealth management. Subject to CCAR approval, we intend to own 100% of wealth management this year. There are numerous benefits associated with owning 100%, including year 1 incremental earnings comparable to the capital required to buy the remaining 35%, driven by the elimination of NCI, contractual revenue upside and some expense savings from the elimination of the JV structure. We will also increase our stable deposit funding and have significant other opportunities.","We have previously laid out a mid-teen margin goal for the middle of this year. We reached and exceeded that goal in the fourth quarter of 2012. We believe that in the future we can drive margins to the high teens and above with modest revenue growth, although please keep in mind the first quarter margin is seasonally lower. With 3 quarters -- 3 years of integration behind us, we are extraordinarily excited about the potential for this business.","The second major driver of high returns is fixed income. Since the financial crisis, we've reduced risk-weighted assets and capital in the Fixed Income business. At their peak, these risk-weighted assets were close to $500 billion. And in the third quarter 2011, before the MBIA transaction, they were approximately $390 billion. This past summer, we laid out a series of RWA targets, including $280 billion at the end of 2013 and $255 billion at the end of 2014. As of the end of 2012, we have, in fact, reached our 2013 targets as we exited the year at $280 billion.","Today, we're establishing lower targets for 2013 and 2014 and providing you with our 2016 target, which we believe will reflect end-state capital and risk-weighted asset levels in this business. The end state will be less than $200 billion of RWAs, down from $390 billion in the third quarter of 2011, and as a result, $18 billion or less of capital, down from $35 billion. Our targets reflect some reinvestment in areas that are important to our clients.","The RWA reductions largely represent runoff. We do not expect the reductions to impair revenues as we run them down. We are committed to having a full service Institutional Securities business, one that is increasingly integrated with our Wealth Management business. We need all 3 of our institutional businesses to be appropriately sized to service our clients.","As we have told you, we have been exiting products in areas which are not strategically rational from a client or franchise perspective. We continue to adapt our offerings and expect the business to continue to evolve as we have more regulatory certainty. We're confident with the steps we've taken to position Institutional Securities for the future.","The third major driver of higher returns is, of course, expenses. One of the things that is little understood about Morgan Stanley is how much money we've been spending on our infrastructure since becoming a financial holding company. We've made great progress in regards to that spending and expect our compensation and non-compensation expenses to decline beyond what we accomplished in 2012, assuming a flat revenue environment. The reductions will be augmented by the expense savings we have discussed with you in the past, as well as new initiatives we have recently undertaken and which I will now discuss today.","On Slide 8, you can follow it where we laid out our best estimates for the net impact of our cost reduction plans over the next 2 years, assuming a flat revenue environment and flat markets. We expect that some of our actions should result in a $1.6 billion decline from 2012 reported expenses to 2014 full year expenses. This reduction is on top of the $500 million already recognized in 2012, reflecting some reinvestment in growth areas that more than offset by our efforts to take out costs.","An important driver of the cost reductions is the 6,000 heads we've taken out of the business in the last 12 months, thereby reducing significant fixed salary and benefit costs. Our expense reductions reflect multiple work streams. Prior to today, we've told you about our reengineering efforts, GWM cost actions and headcount reduction efforts. Some of those cost cuts, as I said, are already reflected in our numbers and more will be recognized over time.","However recently initiated, but as part of our ongoing geographic footprint review, we are reducing and resizing some of our international focus -- some of our international offices so that we can focus mainly on our institutional client coverage and advisory services. These moves enhance the importance of regional centers such as New York, London and Hong Kong. Specifically, in Russia and the Middle East, we're downsizing our local presence in sales and trading, redeploying certain of those resources back to our regional centers. It allows us to cover our key clients in a more efficient manner while reducing middle office expenses.","In other parts of our network, in Europe and Asia, we've made decisions to streamline our footprint, defer expansion plans and exit certain parts of our business. These changes are part of an ongoing evolution as a global institution to depend more on regional centers.","These changes drive efficiencies because functions can be executed more economically from the regional centers due to our centralized trading platforms, execution teams, infrastructure and support. For the purpose of this presentation, we're not counting on a recovery in revenues. If that happens, obviously, our variable expenses, for example, brokerage and clearing, would grow. However, our overall expense ratios should improve if revenues increase. We will continue to look for additional areas to reduce expenses and push beyond 2014.","The fourth driver of higher returns is growth, growth that is not market-dependent, that is unique to Morgan Stanley and in which we do have a high degree of confidence. You're already aware of our focus on our market share in the institutional business, the interest rate and equity market sensitivity in Wealth Management, as well as the contractual upside associated with owning 100% of the Wealth Management joint venture. However, today, we want to speak about 2 additional significant growth opportunities that will drive growth in both institutional and Wealth Management.","First, we believe there's revenue upside and expense savings for both ISG and Wealth Management as we more closely align those businesses. They launched a joint effort in September 2012 to increase collaboration between the businesses. There are currently over 35 initiatives in various stages of execution, and we expect initial impact from this effort in 2013, with upside over the next 10 years -- next 3 years. We lay out those categories on Slide 10, but let me give you a couple of examples.","We're consolidating some of our research efforts across the firm. We've moved some sales and trading management and product execution into Wealth Management. The opportunities in fixed income in particular are very compelling. Among several of those, we recently announced a middle markets fixed income platform. We moved several thousand fixed income clients and a number of salespeople to Wealth Management to increase the intensity of the coverage of those clients and to free up capacity on the institutional side. We're already seeing some positive results. To improve operating efficiency, we believe opportunities exist to eliminate overlapping back-office trading support functions and enhance risk management.","Finally, in the organizational coordination category, we believe there's tremendous opportunity to integrate the senior relationship management effort into Wealth Management. Significant business partners for Wealth Management are very often top clients of the institutional business.","Second area of growth comes from execution of our bank strategy as we're now on a path of having approximately $140 billion in deposits. We've previously discussed opportunities in Wealth Management where we believe our lending product penetration is 500 basis points below our peers. However, there's also upside for Institutional Securities beyond lower funding costs for lending, derivatives and other products. We believe there are substantial opportunities to expand in commercial lending, though consistent of course with our existing skill set and risk management capabilities.","Most importantly, let me now turn to returns. Our focus is to drive higher returns for shareholders through sustainably improving our ROE to levels equal to or in excess of our cost of equity even without a cyclical recovery. Assuming no change in market conditions, normalizing for the CVA drag we saw this year, the Wealth Management buy-in and contractual upside, our expense initiatives and some progress towards our firm-specific growth initiatives, we believe we can reach ROEs of approximately 9% and ROTEs of 11%.  Returning excess capital would get us to 10% levels on ROE and 12% on an ROTE basis. And obviously, an improved operating environment would drive upside beyond those numbers, respectively.","Regarding capital, we have unambiguously moved from a position of shoring up capital through preferred conversions and accreting capital through RWA reductions and earnings to a phase where we believe we're well capitalized. Over the next few years, we will build substantial incremental excess capital in addition to quarterly earnings accretion, driven by additional RWA reductions and reductions in capital in Merchant Banking and Real Estate, consistent with the Volcker Rule.","There is no question that we will return some of this capital. The question is when. Our very near-term focus is acquiring the balance of the Wealth Management joint venture. We'll reinvest some of the capital freed up from some of these opportunities that I've previously described, though the overwhelming amount will be returned to shareholders as soon as it's practical. As always, all capital actions are subject to regulatory approval.","In closing, I want to emphasize that we're working aggressively to drive higher returns. We continue to augment our recent efforts with additional RWA reductions, increased expense savings, additional areas in which we are outright reducing optionality and new efforts to drive revenues higher that are unique to Morgan Stanley. I've also shared with you our thoughts on capital returns.","We've been making tough decisions as and when we have clarity in regards to capital, businesses and people, and we'll continue to do so as regulatory uncertainty lifts. I am confident that we're on a path to increasing shareholder value that will be evident regardless of the macro environment.","Investment banks play an important role in facilitating capital to meet client needs. We believe these needs will grow substantially over the next decade, and we will continue to be a leader. The leadership of this firm has never been more integrated in my time with Morgan Stanley, and I'm very excited about our future.","Thank you. Let me pass it on to Ruth to talk about the fourth quarter.","Ruth Porat","Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures.","DVA in the quarter was a loss of $511 million, with $330 million in fixed income sales and trading and $181 million in equity sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were $7.5 billion, essentially flat to the third quarter.","Non-interest expense was $6.1 billion, down 10% versus the third quarter. Compensation expense was $3.6 billion this quarter, down 8% versus Q3. Non-compensation expense was $2.5 billion, down 13% from last quarter.","The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 11.1%. In our tax line this quarter, we reversed certain tax reserves as a result of new information from IRS exams that resulted in a benefit of $299 million. In addition, we recorded an out-of-period net tax provision of $144 million to adjust previously recorded deferred tax assets principally associated with partnership investments in the Asset Management segment. We are also reviewing the firm's deferred tax accounts.","Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were approximately $867 million. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.45 after preferred dividends. On a reported or GAAP basis, firm-wide revenues for the quarter were $7 billion.","Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $547 million. Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.28 after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was $30.65 per share. Tangible book value was $26.81 per share. Included in the discontinued operations is $115 million associated with the Saxon settlement.","Turning to the balance sheet, our total assets were $782 billion at December 31, up from $765 billion last quarter. Deposits were $83 billion versus $71 billion at the end of the third quarter, driven primarily by retail investors moving to cash towards the end of the quarter and also by the deposits associated with the 14% acquisition of the Wealth Management joint venture.","Our liquidity reserve was $182 billion at the end of the quarter, up $12 billion versus last quarter. And as of January 16, our liquidity was $189 billion. Although calculations are not final, we believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I will be approximately 14.7%, and our Tier 1 capital ratio will be approximately 17.9%. Risk-weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately $306 billion at December 31.","Subject to final rule making and reflecting our best assessment of the rules, our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was 9.5% as of the end of the fourth quarter.","Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, revenues, excluding DVA, were $3.5 billion, down 5% sequentially. Non-interest expense was $2.9 billion, down 12% versus the third quarter.","Compensation was $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter, reflecting a 43% ratio, excluding DVA. Non-compensation expense of $1.4 billion decreased 15% from last quarter. The business reported a pretax profit of $568 million, excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact of DVA, the business reported a pretax profit of $57 million.","In investment banking, revenues of $1.2 billion were up 26% versus last quarter. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked #1 in global IPOs, #2 in global announced M&A, #2 in global equity and #4 in U.S. dollar investment-grade debt at the end of the fourth quarter. Notable transactions included: in equity underwriting, the $733 million IPO of Workday, which was the largest tech IPO since May; in advisory, we acted as lead strategic advisor to ICE on the $8.2 billion definitive agreement to acquire NYSE Euronext; and in debt underwriting, the AbbVie spin financing, including a $14.7 billion in bonds and $7.5 billion event loan and a $4.9 billion tender, the largest U.S. dollar investment-grade offering ever.","Advisory revenues of $454 million were up 34% versus the third quarter, driven by increased revenues in the Americas. Equity underwriting revenues were $237 million, a 19% increase from the third quarter, reflecting increased revenues in EMEA and the Americas.","Fixed income underwriting revenues of $534 million were up 24% versus last quarter and were our highest reported revenues, reflecting increases in investment-grade bond issuance and loan syndication fees.","Equity sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $1.27 billion, an increase of 4% from last quarter. Derivatives had the strongest fourth quarter since 2008, reflecting increased market activity and strength across regions.","Prime brokerage revenues were consistent with the third quarter as average client balances increased moderately. Revenues and cash equities were up slightly, driven by higher market volumes in the Americas and Asia.","Fixed Income and Commodities sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $811 million. Revenues decreased versus our third quarter results as commodities experienced meaningfully lower revenues and a difficult market. CVA, net of hedges, continued to be a drag this quarter due in part to the tightening of our credit spreads.","Less favorable market conditions drove lower rates revenues. However, client volumes held up relatively well across businesses in the quarter, and results also reflect growth in the credit corporate business. Other sales and trading reflects negative revenues of $35 million compared with negative revenues of $162 million last quarter.","Turning to VAR. In our supplement, we provided VAR measures under both our current and previous VAR model for this quarter, the prior quarter and the prior year. Average trading VAR for the fourth quarter was $78 million versus $63 million in the third quarter.","Turning to Global Wealth Management. Revenues of $3.5 billion were up 4% compared to the prior quarter. Asset Management revenues were up, reflecting higher managed money balances. Transaction revenues increased 4% from last quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $579 million, which increased 11%, reflecting higher activity levels by retail investors as they partially reallocated from securities into cash; investment banking-related fees of $209 million, which increased 5% versus last quarter, driven by closed-end fund activity; and trading revenues of $288 million, which were down 8% versus the third quarter, reflecting markdowns in our deferred compensation plans.","Non-interest expense was $2.9 billion, down 7% from last quarter. The compensation ratio was 57% versus 61% in the third quarter, reflecting year-end true ups. Non-compensation expense was $901 million, down 14% versus last quarter, reflecting the absence of non-recurring items reported in 3Q. The PBT margin was 17%, a record since the inception of the joint venture. We reported profit before tax of $581 million in the fourth quarter.","Total client assets were flat at $1.8 trillion, primarily reflecting the minimal impact of market conditions on asset levels and positive flows. Global fee-based asset inflows were $4 billion. Fee-based assets under management increased to $573 billion at quarter end. Global representatives were 16,780, consistent with the third quarter. Bank deposits were $131 billion, with approximately $72 billion held in Morgan Stanley banks.","Asset Management revenues of $599 million were down from $631 million in the third quarter due primarily to lower merchant banking principal investment gains. In Traditional Asset Management, revenues of $376 million were flat to the third quarter. In Real Estate Investing, revenues of $127 million were up versus last quarter. Due to the ownership structure of these funds, the majority of these revenues are passed to third-party investors in the Non-controlling Interest line.","In Merchant Banking, revenues were $96 million compared with $134 million in the third quarter, driven primarily by lower principal investment gains. Compensation expense was $168 million in the quarter, down from $241 million in the third quarter. Profit before tax was $221 million, up from $198 million last quarter. NCI was $49 million versus $50 million last quarter. Total assets under management increased to $338 billion, driven by net inflows of $1 billion and market appreciation.","Let me end with a brief summary of our outlook. In Investment Banking, the advisory pipeline is healthy. Equity underwriting is increasing after a very muted 2012. Although fixed income underwriting reached a record level for us in the fourth quarter, it is important to note that the strength of underwriting was achieved with only modest acquisition finance, which suggests that activity can remain strong, especially if advisory picks up. Sales and trading activity should benefit from ongoing global healing, most notably in Europe and Asia.","And with respect to Wealth Management, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum in the business, with profitability reflecting the benefit of being on one platform, although keep in mind that the first quarter has seasonally higher compensation expense and 2 fewer trading days.","Thank you for listening, and James and I will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","With respect to expenses, the cost reduction targets in a flattish revenue environment is a really strong statement and a helpful benchmark for us. I'm curious, James, how do you broadly think about the incremental margins or returns in a potentially better revenue environment? For example, if revenues were up 10% with a similar business mix, how much do you think would drop to the bottom line?","James P. Gorman","Boy, that's not one I'm going to wing. Look, maybe put pencil to paper. We've been operating so much under the basis that there won't be increased revenues. Obviously, the world is going to evolve, so at some point, that's not true. But our approach is being what can we control? How do we drive up margins in a flat revenue environment? And obviously, through the expense line is how we're doing that. By definition, if we hold the line on our fixed costs, which I think we've been very disciplined about on a go-forward basis, one would assume the incremental dollar revenue would throw off a higher incremental margin than the previous dollar revenue. But I got to go on -- we'd have to go and look at it business by business.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And we saw some really nice expense control within Global Wealth Management. Specific to compensation, you've noted in the past the limited flexibility you might have due to the grid-like comp structure. So I'm curious, what's driving that comp accrual lower in 2012? And how sustainable should we think of that?","Ruth Porat","The main driver of the reduction in the comp ratio is the fact that we are done with integration. As we've talked about on so many calls over the years, the integration expense was running ballpark $80 million to $100 million a quarter until we completed the integration at the end of the second quarter then dropped down in the third and fourth quarter, taper down. That's one major benefit. The second is that as a result of being on one platform, we're able to consolidate a number of back offices and management layers, the items that we outlined really on the third quarter call. And so that's sustainable as well. I think the fourth quarter compensation benefited a bit by what is typical year-end true up, true down. Sometimes it benefits the comp ratio, other times, it doesn't. I think it's fair to say near term, the ratio is likely to be in the 60% range. But very much to your point, there really -- there are a couple of drivers that will reduce that comp ratio more. One is as we're continuing to build out the lending product, the lending product is a non-compensable revenue. It does provide a lift to the margin and drives -- that alone drives the margin into the 50s. And then, again, a better operating environment. In particular, any kind of rate increase has a meaningful benefit to the margin in the business, and that helps as well. So we're good at where we are here, holds you kind of in the first quarter near term to that 15% margin for the reasons I described, with upside.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just finally for me, can you discuss your wholesale funding plans over the next 2 years? I think you have maybe $45 billion-ish maturing through 2014. How much would you like rolled off, and how do you think that funding schedule potentially change as you buy in the rest of the JV this year?","Ruth Porat","Sure. There are a couple of variables to that. We're obviously sitting here, as I noted, with liquidity at higher levels, about $189 billion. So there's some flex in there. We have reduced outstanding indebtedness, outstanding debt this year, unsecured debt by about $19 billion, very much to your point about the changing composition of the balance sheet. And then as we buy in the balance of the wealth management business, the deposits, as I think you know, come on, we'll get about $15 billion when we complete the 35%, but the balance of it comes on ratably over a 2-year period of time. The total size of those deposits is ballpark $140 billion, part of which will be used to support growth in the institutional business. So the 3 components of it will be wealth management lending, institutional lending and other bank-appropriate businesses moving into the bank. As we do that, we get dollar-for-dollar substitution, reducing unsecured debt requirements and replacing them with deposit funding. So all of those provides a bit of flexibility with respect to the magnitude of unsecured debt or wholesale funding that will be required on a go-forward basis.","Operator","The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So I appreciate the further detail on the RWA wind-down. I guess a 2-part question is I'm assuming that it's all passive, but if you look at it, what it does imply, and you guys are by no means alone here, there's $80 billion of RWA that are clogging up the system that have no real revenue impact. So the 2-parter is, one, can anything in the market conditions change that to make there be a positive or a negative revenue impact? Or are we kind of locked and loaded and just waiting for wind-down? And part 2 is what does that RWA wind-down plan imply at all? Does it have revenue implications for fixed income as that plays out?","Ruth Porat","So Glenn, when we put out the initial forecast for risk-weighted assets and RWA reduction, we were looking at -- there are obviously 3 levels -- levers. There's passive mitigation, active mitigation and model approval. And the guidance last summer was primarily based on passive mitigation, just scheduled roll-offs to maturity sub-positions [ph]. I've had some active, but it was primarily passive. What we've done through the back half of 2012 was accomplished through active mitigation. In other words, we pulled forward some of the passive mitigation that was embedded in that earlier forecast, but it was through active mitigation that we ended the year at $280 billion of risk-weighted assets and were able to pull forward our forecast by a year. And the way we've been accomplishing the active mitigation is, really, with minimal P&L impact, and that's the way we're continuing to look at it. We're really reducing capital behind positions that are -- in areas that are not revenue-accretive longer term.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So just making sure I got it right, any way you slice it, as the RWA runoff, good or bad market conditions, it's going to have no revenue impact.","Ruth Porat","I said it's minimal revenue impact. That's the way we've been looking at it. And I think you had one other part of your question I didn't quite address. The reason we've been able to accomplish this pull-forward is this is, as you know, a real priority for us. We have strict governance around it. Our senior leadership team is very committed to it, and that's enabled us to pull forward, through active mitigation, more reduction in 2012 and set us up for this decline as we're looking at in '13 and beyond, at minimal P&L impact.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Got it. Ruth, you've mentioned the 43% true comp ratio at ISG. I'm assuming that was the year, not the quarter, correct?","Ruth Porat","Correct.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And that's come down and I think the shareholders be cool with that. We've seen some stuff in the press about changes on the deferral. Not something normally I'd ask you to comment on, but I'm just curious on the impact on future periods. So the change in deferred, I've seen this happen in the past at some other companies. How much of a contingent liability does that create on the go-forward? Or is it not material to the overall story?","Ruth Porat","Well, a couple of things in terms of the compensation structure. So we did change the comp structure again this year. We raised the total compensation level at which deferrals start, so over 82% of people don't have deferrals, and it's really -- think of it as those who are in the earlier parts of their careers. So it's really for the more senior people that we have deferrals. The vesting schedule is still over 3 years, and it's the combination of cash and equity, which we think further enhances alignments of interest. But as we talked about on calls last year, we said the absolute amount of deferrals would be going down. It is continuing to go down. The actual amount of deferrals in 2013 is lower than 2012, and the aggregate amount continues to decline. And I think as important, as James noted in his comments, when you combine that with the actions we've taken reducing headcount, base and benefits are also meaningfully lower. We're paying 6,000 fewer people in 2013. And then you add that to things like location sourcing. So kind of that fixed element of it, if that's where you framed it, is declining.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Now that's super helpful. And then last one for me, commodities, specifically, and I appreciate the environment has been a soft one, and I've seen it everywhere. Is the business actually changed such that maybe it doesn't fit inside a broker-dealer anymore? In other words, would private equity be a better owner? It seems -- curious if you would allocate, I'm sure you won't, but I'll try, the risk-weighted assets associated with it? It feels like, wow, 3 out of 4 quarters this year were pretty soft. In other words, in your mind, is it cyclical versus something changed?","Ruth Porat","Yes, there were some quite specific issues in the environment that affected commodities this quarter, in particular. I mean, as you know well, our business is both physical and trading, and it's also primarily oil and power. And when you combine storm-related dislocation, continued backwardation with lower prices affecting our storage business and then the lower volatility, we had a series of things that resulted in, basically, de minimis revenues in commodities this quarter, very unusual one over time. So we do think there's quite a cyclical element to it, storm-related element to it, however you want to frame it.","James P. Gorman","Yes, I'd just add firstly, to put the quarter in context, and I know the second quarter was also challenging, you have to go back to 1995, I think, to find quarters like that. So it was fairly aberrant. These businesses don't turn that quickly on a dime, good or bad. We have a tremendous Commodities business, tremendous team. They had an aberrant environment, difficult environment, difficult quarter, and we moved on past that. On the broader strategic things, I mean, if we could find a structure that was more advantageous for everybody, we'd do that, and obviously, as we've said publicly, we're open to that. But this is not because we don't think it's a great business. We're just constantly looking at the combination of capital, liquidity, funding and the mix of those 3 things and trying to figure out the best way to move forward.","Operator","The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","I think this goes in the category of good progress but could it be better. So starting with Slide 12, you identify targets for return on tangible equity at 11%, going to 12% at some point, but you don't put a time frame around that. Can you give us any better sense of timing when you expect to achieve that?","Ruth Porat","What we tried to do, Mike, was lay out in the deck the key components that are embedded in that 9%, so the expense initiatives, the capital efficiency, the drivers in wealth management and Institutional Securities. So just focusing on the expense -- well, let's start from the top. Wealth initiative and the buy-in there, as James said, that's one item that we put into CCAR. That's with a focus to accomplish as soon as possible, subject to regulatory approval. And the benefit, to be clear, of the wealth management buy-in is not just the incremental 35% earnings but the contractual upside once we own 100% results in earnings that are about the same as that which we get from retaining the NCI. And then on top of that, when you're talking about ROE, clearly, as I've been talking about for many quarters, we've been holding capital against the stake. So that's deadweight capital. We'll finally get not just the NCI but that contractual earnings against it. That's helpful and that's submitted within our CCAR now. The expense initiatives, as we outlined on the chart, are over the next 2 years. And so you can see the $1.6 billion reduction in the 2-year period of time. I think the RWA reductions, we're continuing to focus on that near term and the growth initiatives as well. So we're not putting a specific timeline on it, but try to guide you there with the way we laid out the other key drivers of the upside.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And for the expense reduction, now that is a big number, $1.6 billion, but you've made such good progress here recently that if you annualize fourth quarter results, I guess that's just $400 million incremental per year. Am I doing the math correctly, or how should I think about that?","Ruth Porat","Well, the reason we pulled it all together in $1.6 billion, as we've been talking to you over the last year or 2 about a number of different initiatives, the Office of Re-engineering, the wealth management efforts, the headcount reduction, so the goal was to pull everything together with a holistic view of it. As it relates to reengineering, which is both comp and non-comp, we targeted a $1.4 billion run rate reduction by 2014 and a $500 million run rate reduction by the end of 2012. Our expenses in aggregate are down $500 million between 2011 and 2012, a little different mix there but down by that $500 million. So now when you layer on top of it the integration in wealth management, the benefit from the consolidation steps, the headcount reduction, line by line buildup takes you to that $1.6 billion over the 2-year period of time. So I wouldn't say annualize the 2011 over 2012 reduction. This is really by initiative, takes you to the $1.6 billion over that period of time based on our best estimates, what we know now and, as we said, assuming a flat revenue environment.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And the wealth management margin, great, you're 17%, but I guess your target is still mid-teens. So why not increase the targets?","Ruth Porat","We're keeping it for now at the mid-teens target, and we're pleased with the 17% and all that we had to do with the franchise completing the integration that set us up to achieve the 17% margin. But as I said previously, we wouldn't guide you to hold that 17% in the first quarter for a couple of reasons. One, there are fewer trading days, and it is seasonally slightly higher comp ratio. So holding the comp ratio, at least near term, in that 60% range, implying sort of a 15-ish percent margin near term, we think, is prudent, appropriate. But again, for the reasons we've talked about, namely the expense savings through consolidation, coupled with the upside we see with our growth in lending, that should take you to higher levels. And if you have any lift at all from the environment, in particular, on the rate side, it does as well. But we're going to hold for now to the mid-teens and wait to see those play out over time.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","And then lastly, backlogs, you said equity underwriting is higher. Is that link quarter, year-over-year or both? And can you also give those -- that information for total investment banking?","Ruth Porat","So the equity pipeline is up going into the year, so quarter-over-quarter, and as I said, it's driven by greater activity in Europe and Asia, in particular. Those were pretty muted throughout 2012. So with the healthier backdrop, in particular, in Europe, we're looking for more activity. And then -- I'm sorry, the second part of your question was...","Michael Mayo - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","Just backlogs, any other color you can give. So that's equity. What about fixed income?","Ruth Porat","Fixed income tends to have a slightly shorter pipeline. It has been a very constructive environment for refinancing. I think there have been some debate as to was activity pulled into the fourth quarter from the first quarter. Our view very much is it was not. This was just good refinancing effort and corporate clients being opportunistic because of low rates, and so there is more to come. We think that although you never want to forecast an extension off of a record quarter, the offset to any kind of declines there. In fact, the M&A market remains as constructive as it appears we could see some more event lending activity, in particular, non investment-grade activity. So I don't want to suggest that you should extrapolate off of the fourth quarter, given it was a record, but we feel good about the ongoing interest by clients in financing activity.","Operator","The next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Quick question here. The roughly $50 billion of RWA reduction that we're going from current to year-end '14, have you guys provided the risk weights for those assets? And if not, would you do so?","Ruth Porat","We have not. We thought we were actually being quite expansive breaking out the risk weights by category. We've given you some of the product areas, but we have not broken it out more than that.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I assume in the run-off that you guys had, even though you had some opportunistic active runoff here this quarter, that the forward look is still all passive. Is that right?","Ruth Porat","It's overwhelmingly passive, just as we built up the first forecast. And I think one of the potentially obvious points is given the focus in governance around RWA reduction, we were able to pull forward and execute. And again, there's only so many times you can pull things forward. But this is primarily passive mitigation at this point with a focus on trying to continue to accelerate some of the active.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I'm sorry if I missed this, but can you or have you quantified the revenue opportunity that's in the order flow capture once you guys own all of MSSB?","Ruth Porat","We haven't broken out the order flow agreement separately, but when you take the order flow agreement, the return on higher deposits, very importantly, assuming that those additional deposits, near term, merely fund the AFS portfolio and the reduction of the expenses associated with running a joint venture like extra reporting and other items like that, those 3 items in the aggregate are about comparable to the earnings from the 35%. And again, a couple of items. One, that's, again, assuming that if we're just putting that into an AFS portfolio, clearly, as we're lending it out there, it's greater returns. And that's the key point.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sure. So as we're modeling this, a check figure would be maybe to watch the -- take a look at the NCI and double it effectively. And then as along as we're getting that kind of upside, then we're in the right ballpark.","Ruth Porat","Yes. I think one thing you probably want to look at is the slide that James walked you through. We indicated that the incremental capital, ballpark $400 million, and that the earnings in the first year, ballpark the same number. So we're kind of helping you triangulate right back to those -- how much that will bring.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Yes, I appreciate that. And then just last one for me. On the wealth management business, can you give some color around risk appetite and what you guys are seeing around all this noise out of D.C.? Is it impacting risk appetites there? Are you starting to see a little relief now that we've moved past some of it or at least people might realize that noise and all that out of D.C. are just a permanent part of the landscape at this point?","James P. Gorman","Let me take a cut at that because I've been pretty involved with some of the stuff going on in the fiscal side and trying to get the temperature of the retail investor. I would say that somewhere around early December, there was a shift in tone and a pickup in activity and by definition, a pickup in risk appetite. So investors were re-engaging. Businesses of this size and this geographic dispersity don't move dramatically month to month, but there was definitely a tonal shift. I think it's too early, obviously, in this quarter to say much about that. But it feels similar, and the more progress that we have on the fiscal front, the more confidence investors will have to get out there and invest. The other thing you have to look at, Brennan, is that the 401(k) plans are up materially last year, so the wealth impact of people is up materially. They get to the end of the year, they see their 401(k) holding is up, on average, equity side, up 15%. That has a real driving factor around investment behavior. So I think we -- my personal view is that absent a reversal in the U.S. economy, which I don't anticipate, or a complete mess up in Washington, which I don't anticipate because they're making progress, I think we've passed the bottom.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Well, you can never not count on a complete mess up out of Washington.","Operator","The next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","On the lending in Global Wealth Management, do you have a target loan-to-deposit ratio that you'd like to move towards?","Ruth Porat","At this point, we don't. I think the main point to note is we do have the largest retail distribution system. And as James noted, we think there's real upside because only 5% of our clients are currently using our lending suite. It's ballpark 10% for our peers, and that's just because historically, this hasn't been a strategic focus for us. So our deposits will be growing to about $140 billion post-acquisition. We think we have real meaningful upside there. It wouldn't be fully utilized just on the wealth management side, at least in the very near term. We're continuing to be quite prudent about the way we're growing that portfolio. And that's why when we talk about deposit growth, it's not just with respect to wealth management, but it's also what we're doing on the institutional side with relationship lending and event lending and with additional products moving into the bank, bank-appropriate products such as things like commercial real estate lending or asset-based lending with our existing corporate clients.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Fair enough. On your Slide 7, James, on the FICC discussion, the RWA net reduction of $30 billion through sort of the net of strategic reductions and growth, is there any way that we can get under that just to see how you're thinking about how you would shift emphasis on the business within FICC?","Ruth Porat","The focus within FICC is very consistent with what we've been talking about for quite some time. And so there are areas of growth within those core product areas we're continuing to be active in rates and have invested in it at foreign exchange. Similarly, we're continuing to benefit from the electronic trading platform. In fact, we set new records internally for trade volumes last quarter. Credit remains important to us. We're very active in mortgages. So it continues to be in the areas that we've spoken about, and we just wanted to leave some cushion for ongoing growth there, which is part of the plan.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Sure, that's helpful. On Page 12 of the slides, can you give us a sense for how much of getting to that 9% ROE with no change in market conditions would be contingent on getting to the FICC market share targets that you've laid out in the past?","Ruth Porat","We've tried to give as many levers as we can. We are still committed to the market share gains, the 2% market share gains that we've talked about. We're also very focused on the returns in the business, and you can see that with what we've done on RWA reduction, but I haven't broken that out.","James P. Gorman","Yes, but it sounds like fundamentally, you did assume in that analysis that you did gain those couple of points of share.","Ruth Porat","No, because what we have here as first bullet is -- no change in market conditions, is essentially just a flat revenue environment and then layer in the actions that we've put into this slide deck here.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","Okay. So you don't assume that you have any meaningful share gain within the context of the flat market? I just want to make sure I understand what your assumptions are.","Ruth Porat","Yes. We have 2 -- let me be very clear here. For purposes of the slide and the 9%, we've delineated the steps that we're taking, assuming no change in market condition. For purposes of the way we're running the business and the way our business leaders think about the business, of course, we're continuing to pursue the market share gains for all the reasons that we've talked about. I was answering 2 questions, I apologize.","Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research LLP","No, but now it's clear. That helps a lot. And then finally, just not to harp on this margin target on GWM, but it almost sounds like you want to raise the target there, except that you don't want to do that in the face of some seasonality in the first quarter on the expense base, and I understand that. But should we be thinking that it goes up, that the target goes up beyond the first quarter?","James P. Gorman","Let me have a go at this. I mean, listen. Firstly, one quarter is 13 weeks. So let's not get too wound up about precisely where we are. As Ruth said, there's some seasonality. We were criticized in the past for laying out a 20% margin 4 years ago for this business. We didn't anticipate a very difficult market. We didn't anticipate 0 interest rates, and we're guilty as charged. So we said we would deliver in this business mid-teen margins by the middle of next year, and that's what we're focused on. So let's revisit it, Guy, when we get to the mid-teen margins in the middle of next year.","Operator","The final question will come from Fiona Swaffield with RBC Bank of Canada.","Fiona Swaffield - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask on your Basel III capital ratio and what you think your target is now post -- do you think -- I noticed somewhere there was a 9% yield to investment bank in the capital allocation on the risk-weighted assets side. And then secondly, just within your Slide 12, when you talked about 1% accretion from returning excess capital, I mean, that seems quite low. Is that just in 1 year, or could you just talk a bit more about that?","Ruth Porat","Certainly. So we're assuming that we'll run at a buffer above the requirements. So with our GCP buffer, that would put us at about 8.5%, run at a buffer above that. We're obviously looking to continue to accrete capital which will take those ratios up, in particular, with what we're doing on the RWA reduction side. And then the question really becomes over what time do we -- are we returning capital, and that's a function of earnings in the regulatory environment. And it's also how do we look to reinvest some of that capital in our business. I mean, there's some pretty obvious areas with $140 billion of deposits coming on and the opportunity to grow the suite of lending products, as I've talked about, both wealth management and institutional. Some of it goes behind that. But we have not laid out a timeline for the return of capital, and we'll leave it to you to model in how much upside, incremental upside there is over what period of time returning excess capital.","Well, with that, we thank you very much for joining our fourth quarter call and look forward to speaking to you in 13 weeks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14929":["Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Q1 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call April 17, 2019  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Sharon Yeshaya - Head of Investor Relations","James Gorman - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Jonathan Pruzan - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Conference Call Participants","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Mike Mayo - Wells Fargo","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Steven Chubak - Wolfe Research","Christian Bolu - Autonomous","Devin Ryan - JMP Securities","Andrew Lim - Societe Generale","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Al Alevizakos - HSBC","Sharon Yeshaya","Good morning. This is Sharon Yeshaya, Head of Investor Relations. During today's presentation, we'll refer to our earnings release and financial supplement. Copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James Gorman","Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2019 has started well. In the first quarter, our business has produced solid results and rebounded from the fourth quarter's market dislocation and idiosyncratic events. In our Institutional businesses, client participation and balances steadily improved alongside confidence and asset prices. While activity was not as robust as early 2018, the improvement in sentiment, CEO dialogue and boardroom conversations were all encouraging.","Our Wealth business absorbed lower fourth quarter asset levels and delivered strong results. The margin demonstrated the business' ability to withstand shocks to asset values. In Investment Management, we've posted very strong investment results, particularly in private real assets and private equity. Broad client relationships have driven net inflows in our global equity strategies, where long-term performance continues to attract investors.","We remain confident in the firm's outlook and broader economic activity, but we're cognizant that global risk more balanced. Against this backdrop, we remained very focused on expense discipline, while it's still investing for growth. This focus is evident in the results. On a year-over-year basis, total non-interest expenses declined 4%, even as we continued our investments.","Across the board, ROE, ROTCE, the firm efficiency ratio and Wealth Management margin are in line with or at the higher end of our strategic objectives, ensuring a very solid start of the year.","Consistent with our objective to investment growth, we announced our intent to acquire Solium Capital, a leading global software provider for equity administration, financial reporting and compliance. This transaction will enable us to bring together a major stock plan administration platform with the leading wealth management business, positioning us to be a top tier provider in the workplace wealth space. Through Solium, we gained a new scalable channel and direct sales force getting us the ability to target another client population, particularly a younger demographic and its wealth accumulation phase.","On a combined basis, we will now have direct exposure over 2.5 million individuals by Solium's workplace services, complimenting the other three million wealth management clients, our financial advisors already served in our traditional business. What excites us is the expansion into the workplace? Delivering financial wellness services to clients and offering financial advice, education and the ability to transact through their employer. This deal is aligned with our strategic objective to round out our product offerings with complimentary bolt-on acquisitions. And we will continue to look for similar opportunities.","We recently announced that Colm Kelleher would be retiring from the firm effective June 30th. As all of you know Colm was the Chief Financial Officer during the global financial crisis and was critical in helping navigate the firm through those challenging times. Over the course of his study and career, Colm has served in a number of important roles across our businesses, most recently as President of the firm. I'm extremely grateful to Colm for his contributions. And it has been a great privilege to call him my partner for the past decade. As we move forward, the Board and I very focused on long-term development of our management team.","So now, I would turn the call over to Jon to discuss this quarter in greater detail. Thank you.","Jonathan Pruzan","Thank you and good morning. January opened with fragile sentiment and lackluster conviction, while we witnessed a gradual improvement as the first quarter progress signs of the December hangover and the U.S. government shutdown were evident. Clients took time to regain confidence, and industry volumes declined impacting our ISG businesses.","Lower asset values at the end of 4Q impacted Wealth Management and Investment Management fee revenues. Still, the firm produced solid results. Revenues of $10.3 billion declined only 7% year-over-year compared against the strongest quarter in the firm's history ex-DVA. On a sequential basis revenues increased 20%. PBT was $3 billion and EPS was $1.39.","The firm delivered returns at the high-end of our target ranges with an ROE of 13.1 and ROTCE of 14.9. We continued to focus on expenses while investing in the business. Total non-interest expense was $7.3 billion, down 4% from 1Q '18. We remained committed to funding investments to tight focus on our more controllable expenses such as marketing and business development and professional services. The firm's non-compensation expenses were down 2% year-over-year despite elevated Brexit-related expenses and ongoing investment and technology.","Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities generated revenues of $5.2 billion in the first quarter, a 35% sequential increase. EMEA rebounded nicely, and Asia also demonstrated strength. We saw client activity and engagement gain momentum in the back half of the quarter.","Non compensation expenses were $1.8 billion for the quarter, a 3% decline from the prior year.","Compensation expenses were $1.8 billion, resulting in compensation to net revenue ratio of 35%, consistent with last year's ratio.","In Investment Banking, we generated revenues of $1.2 billion, a 19% increase relative to the fourth quarter, after a slow start momentum and confidence picked up.","Advisory revenues for the quarter were $406 million, down 45% sequentially. Completed M&A volumes declined 38% relative to an active fourth quarter. Importantly, there has been a pickup in activity levels, and pipelines are healthy.","Turning to underwriting, new issue market conditions were more challenged at the outset, but issuance built momentum as the quarter progressed. Our equity underwriting franchise remained strong. Revenues of $339 million were up 5% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential strength in blocks, follow-ons and convertibles offset weak IPO revenue. IPO volumes witnessed a short sequence of decline of 79%. Many issuers were sidelined by the U.S. government shutdown.","Fixed income underwriting revenues increased 13% sequentially to $406 million. We saw an increase in bond issuance volumes across investment-grade and high-yield, while our leveraged loan activity remained muted.","Overall Investment Banking pipelines remained healthy and diversified across products, regions and sectors. CEOs remain engaged the global equity pipeline has built through the quarter, particularly IPOs, and market volatility is subdued.","However, as demonstrated by recent market dynamics, future activity may be impacted by macro economic uncertainty and geopolitical events.","In equities, we retained our leadership position and expect to be number one globally. Revenues were $2 billion, declining 21% year-over-year and increasing 4% quarter-over-quarter. On a sequential basis, derivatives and cash revenues improved with derivatives benefiting from improved markets and corporate activity.","In prime brokerage, sequential and year-over-year revenue declines were driven by lower average balances. Clients gradually relevered and balances partially recovered over the course of the quarter and continue to build. While market indices have rallied materially and sentiment has improved, clients remain cautious.","First quarter fixed income results were strong following the traditional seasonal pattern. Revenues in 1Q were $1.7 billion, more than doubling weak fourth quarter results. Overall, client activity improved over the quarter. The market was generally characterized by tightening credit spreads, declining interest rates, low volatility and uneven client activity across business lines as well as benefits from structured client activity.","Macro rebounded broadly on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Compared to prior year, our macro performance reflected dampened volatility impacting structure rates and FX. Macro investors remain sideline lack in conviction and awaiting clarity around Central Bank policy, Brexit and U.S.-China relationship.","Micro results were robust both sequentially and annually, driven by particular strength in corporate credit. Tightening credit spreads and increased secondary trading activity resulted in higher client revenues. We saw increased velocity over the balance sheet in the quarter Commodities had strong broad base results with solid trading performance and lower structured revenues in Q1 '18.","Wealth Management reported quarterly revenues of $4.4 billion and pre-tax profit at $1.2 billion. Despite lower starting asset levels, the business produced the PBT margin of 27.1% demonstrating resilience despite large market drawdowns in the fourth quarter.","Total client assets ended the quarter at $2.5 trillion, an 8% increase versus the prior quarter, reflecting positive asset flows to the firm and the rebound in asset prices. Net fee-based asset flows were $15 billion, and additionally, we continue to see improvement in the productivity of our advisers.","Transactional revenues were $817 million. Movements in deferred compensation to investments were significantly impacted fourth quarter revenues, partly reversed in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of the gains on the plans, transactional revenues were down slightly quarter-over-quarter. Revenues were impacted by client's defensive posture and the relatively slow syndicate calendar.","In particular, we witnessed a rotation out of equities into short-term fixed income products. Asset management revenues were $2.4 billion. The 8% decline from the prior quarter was primarily driven by last quarter's lower ending asset levels. Total bank lending ended the quarter at $71.5 billion. While funded balances declined slightly quarter-over-quarter, driven by a handful of large pay downs in the tailored lending book and a modest decline and security-based lending, commitments did rise. The rise in commitments and solid mortgage growth over the quarter are encouraging and we continue to expect mid single-digit percentage loan balance growth for the full year.","Net interest income growth of 3% to $1.1 billion was primarily driven by the benefit of the December rate increase and the corresponding impact on our investment portfolio yields. Additionally, we benefited from the increased level of deposits at the beginning of the quarter, which was partially offset by higher prepayments fees.","Strong non-compensation expense discipline and the benefit of the retention note roll-off more than offset the effect of lower asset values, resulting in a margin of 27.1%. As demonstrated during the quarter, we have leveraged to protect the margin, while still investing for growth.","Investment Management produced very strong results. Revenues of $804 million were up 18% sequentially and were the highest for the segment in over five years. This was driven by $191 million of investment revenues.","Investment strength was broad based across products. The sequential increase was supported by the rebound in global markets and the absence of last quarter's impairment charge. As noted historically, this line item has the potential to be lumpy.","Total AUM of $480 billion was up 4% versus the prior quarter with long-term AUM of $321 billion, increasing 7%. The increase in long-term AUM was primarily driven by strong market related growth.","Asset management fees of $617 million were down 2% sequentially. The higher management fees on the back of improved average AUM over the quarter were offset by lower performance fees. As we have mentioned before, as a result of the revenue recognition accounting rule implemented in 2018, a significant amount of any year's performance fees will be recognized in the fourth quarter with a small amount being recognized in this first quarter. Total expenses increased by 3% quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher carry compensation, which offset a decline in non-comp expenses.","Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets of $876 billion increased 3%, driven by client activity primarily in equity sales and trading and ISG lending. The higher balance sheet drove an increase in RWA is resulting in a decrease of our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio to 16.5% from 16.9%. During the quarter we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of common stock or approximately 28 million shares at $42, and our Board declared a $0.30 dividend per share.","Our tax rate in the first quarter was 19.9 executing $101 million of intermittent net discrete tax benefits. We continue to expect our full year tax rate will be similar to the 2018 tax rate, excluding intermittent items. The vast majority of our share based award conversions took place in the first quarter.","Markets in the second quarter had been constructive. Pipelines are healthy in Investment Banking, and higher asset levels will support fee-based revenues in our Wealth Management business. We are keenly aware that open and functioning markets and economic stability are instrumental in supporting confidence and activity levels moving forward.","With that, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS. Your line is open.","Brennan Hawken","First question is on non-comp expense. We saw a pullback nicely here in the quarter. Can you help us think about how we should think about the amount of flex that you haven't outlined to potentially offset environmental pressure? If we see that flaring up again that, maybe a bit of a context around fixed versus variable?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. I'll take a shot. And as you said, we thought -- we had a nice quarter on the non-comp side. We continue to make investments. You'll see that in the IP and fee line in terms of technology. And where we've been able to tighten really has been in around marketing and business development and professional services. We did see an uptick in Brexit expenses, but we were effectively able to self-fund those. And again, we continue to see opportunities and levers if needed, in those sort of more controllable, if you will, line items like marketing and business development and professional services. We did also see, as you would expect, year-over-year, a decline in some of the execution related expenses given the decline in revenues, but again, a nice quarter for us on the expense side, 71% efficiency ratio, well below our target of 73.","Brennan Hawken","And then switching gears to Solium. James, I know you've referenced it and provided some high level context around how you're thinking about it strategically. But maybe -- could you help us think about how you see this fitting in a bit more granularity in the different businesses? My guess is it's primarily a wealth management, customer acquisition tool, potentially. But I would think that it might play in a bit on the banking side too, particularly in developing relationships with private. It comes along with fictional cash. So there seem to be a few different levers here that can help. Can you help us try to think about how you see those playing out after the deal closes and you onboard? What type of a timeframe should we be thinking about before we can start to see some of these impacts? Is there a conversion that needs to happen? How -- could you help us a little with backing impact on around that? Thanks.","James Gorman","Well, I think, you have answered most Brennan. Thank you. Strategically this is pretty obvious to me. There are basically three ways to -- three major channels for reaching Wealth Management clients. One is through some sort of advisory platform. Other is financial planners, advisors, et cetera. And we are -- I would say, we're kind of A-plus in that zone. The second is through the pure direct that\u2019s not been a core focus about. And there are some very big established players there. And the third is through the workplace and through increasingly what's called financial wellness whether it's financial planning, education and obviously conversion, stock plans -- stock option plans, 401(k)s, IRAs and the like. And that\u2019s what Solium really does. It's like the -- I don\u2019t know if you have observed the -- I was growing up in Australia, I used to watching these ads on TV about picture time where he said he liked the razor so much and bought the company. So he went and bought the company. Well, we liked Solium so much when we outsourced to them and we went and bought the company. And you're right. This isn\u2019t just getting access to 2.5 million prospective clients by the way when their assets convert over from the stock plans they convert into -- they will be converting into Morgan Stanley accounts. So that's a very part of the initiative.","The other part, as you pointed out, treasury functions, pension management, other forms of cash management, which we go through the Investment Management group. The private wealth and financial advisory teams will continue to focus on C-Suite and senior executives. The IPO on banking teams, where it\u2019s a small company potentially going public will come in. And obviously, offer those services. So there are four, five ways into what is about, I think, it's about 3,000 small companies they have on their platform. Ours tend to be bigger. We have about 300. And I just think it\u2019s a very exciting relatively inexpensive, frankly, against the size of Morgan Stanley. It\u2019s very inexpensive in terms of absolute deal size. It obviously wasn't cheap on a notable basis. But I see it is buying the technology and giving its access to a new channel with notable verticals into it.","Jonathan Pruzan","And then just briefly on timing, we would expect the deal will close shortly. There is clearly some conversion and technology builds. And combining that will do probably as a 12 to 18 month type of conversion period. And then what expect to see the synergies that James talked about thereafter. So we're very excited about it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Mike Mayo","Jon, you used a lot of additives saying the pipelines healthy, improved, and just one, if you can put some numbers on the backlog. And especially the IPO backlog, I mean, there's a lot of chatter in the market about the number of IPOs upcoming. And I guess you get more than your fair share in tech IPOs. Can you quantify kind of what you're saying? What\u2019s in the pipeline? What's maybe little after the pipeline? What other period you compared this to?","Jonathan Pruzan","I will try to give you a little bit more context. Although I think the additives were our attempt to give you that context. First and foremost, we're number one in global equity and IPOs. That\u2019s not just a tech comment, that\u2019s a broad base franchise that we're very confident in. And as you know, given the sort of December hangover, the earnings season as well as the government shutdown, we did feel a significant portion of the IPO calendar gets pushed out, not canceled, but pushed out. We also then saw over the course of the quarter, increasing build up of the pipeline in the IPO product. So we feel very confident about our backlog, the health of the backlog and the size of the backlog. And right now, we do have a pretty constructive market in terms of equity vol and just overall evaluation. So assuming those markets stay opening and functioning, we feel very good about the ECM product and the ECM opportunity. This quarter, we had strength, really we sort of pivoted to blocks and secondary's and converts. So a smaller number than general, but still a strong number relative to what the opportunity set was. And as I described, backlogs are healthy, and it's really going to depend on the markets openness and willingness to bring these deals from the pipeline into the market.","Mike Mayo","And then a separate question. Just on the Wealth Management margin, I mean, that's just going from 24% to 27%. It seems like there could be some one-time items or noise in that. I guess what's your outlook for that? And James, I know, I always ask this, but with the rebound the asset values, it seems like you sandbag with your pre-tax margin of 26%, 28%, now, 27% in the middle of that. But, why not raise that target? Where do you think that will be ahead? And was there any noise in this quarter?","James Gorman","Well, Mike, I think we're going to have this ongoing discussion probably for another decade. Let's see. I don't know that a midpoint result is a sandbag, but anyway, I will take that offline. Listen, the first quarter had -- there weren't any peculiar one-off things, and Jon will correct me if I'm wrong about that, but they weren't any. The business has scale. I mean, the bottom line, the business has scale of point margin on $4.4 billion of revenues, $44 million. If you manage the expenses tightly, which the team did, they had decent activity in the secondary stuff, not great, but decent. They manage it tightly. You can move the needle quickly. And we -- there is no -- I've been saying this for many, many years. This is the ultimate scale business. If you put down the railway tracks in the right way, it rolls. Every now and then, there's a little saying on the tracks which creates some friction, and every now and then you're going downhill, it goes a little faster. And that's -- the important thing is, the assets were priced at a very low level on December 31, relatively low level, and the business delivered notwithstanding. Now, as you know, we had two of the three months included the benefit from the compensation deal running off, which ran off at the end of January. By the way, I haven't noticed any attrition resulting from that, which didn't expect, we didn't get. And we get three months of that coming into the second quarter. Assets priced more favorably in the second quarter. And we'll see how we do with expenses. But there's no magic to this. So it's pretty consistent. For a really bad quarter is 24.5% margin. We used to dream of having margins, which had 15% on them. So I'll take that as really bad quarter, and if a really good quarter surprises, the upside of the range. But we talked about the 26 to 28. So be it could happen.","Jonathan Pruzan","I would just mention that the idiosyncratic events were really around the fourth quarter, not around the first quarter. So I think the fourth quarter was depressed by some of the things that we did. And the first quarter was just shows the benefit of scale and our ability to pull levers and sort of manage between growth and investment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Glenn Schorr","Question on just what to expect, even though you can't expect too much, on fixed seasonality in the first quarter, I'm sure is as strong as ever been, you put a very good result. I just want to make sure we get our expectations in the right place regarding seasonality. And then on the flip side of that, in equity trading, I think public volumes are overall light, but my question is, what are you seeing on reengagement of PB client balances on margin?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. I'll try to take that. On the FID side, you are absolutely correct, first quarter has the seasonal strength to it. I would say -- certainly, four out of the last five years, the first quarter is the strongest quarter of the year. And we'll have to see how it plays out. But that's the general historical seasonality to that business. We had a nice quarter. As I mentioned in the call, a nice rebound from a disappointing fourth quarter and the business. We have a lot of confidence in that business and continue to do well. On the equity side, we came into the quarter with activity levels low and average balances or balances quite low given the volatility in the December timeframe. As I mentioned, we did see PB balances grow steadily throughout the quarter. I would say they're still below the levels that we saw sort of in the first nine months of 2018. But they have steadily increased and continued to increase in this quarter. But it's interesting that the sentiment in that speaks, although the markets have rebounded, I would say that the participants are still quite cautious. But balances are clearly rebounding, but just not back to the level as we saw in a very prefer -- very strong first nine months of last year.","Glenn Schorr","One quick one, Jon. There's a lot of news flow related to lift and Morgan Stanley's potential participation in helping original investors hedge. I know you can't talk about a specific issue. What I want to ask is what's normal course of business? How does that -- what takes place behind the scenes that we don't see? And then if you could comment anything on that particular shift, that'd be great.","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, but, I mean, we can't, obviously, we can't comment on that Glenn. But we are in the market making business on behalf of clients. I mean, that's what you do in this industry. And, there's no, from our perspective, there's absolutely nothing done wrong in dealing with those particular shifts, but that's for another day.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Jim Mitchell","Sort of fit into capital, I mean, now that you've kind of taken a look at the new, the fast scenarios, how are you feeling relative to last year with respect to the CCAR submission? How should we think about that?","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes, as you know, we just submitted our plan here at the beginning of the month. So we had no particular color or context about the results. We'll get those at the end of June. I think you saw in January what we said is, and we continue to say we have sufficient capital, and we would like to return 100% of our earnings going forward. The tests, as you saw, certainly some of the metrics in the tests, and the macro factors were less severe than they were last year. And we started the year with roughly the same balance sheet and more capital. So we were in a stronger position. But we'll have to see what the results come out in January. But I would continue to say that we believe we are capital sufficient and we would like to continue to return our earnings to our shareholders.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. So no change for the 100%? And maybe just a follow up on the differed comp, can you help us just to understand if there was material P&L impact? I would assume there were some offset in comp, but if you could just sort of help with that.","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. And I would say you sum it up properly, which is the PBT impact both in terms of dollars and margin is actually quite minimal. You do see some variances and revenues in comp where you will see the most differences. But overall, from a PBT standpoint, this quarter there was virtually no impact to the bottom line. On a margin basis, the vast, vast majority of the time, the margin will be diluted by movements in PBT because we're generally pulling out very low margin dollars from both revenue -- from the PBT line so revenue expense come out at a low margin basis. So it's dilutive to the margin. But again, from a bottom line perspective, very limited impact this quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Steven Chubak","So wanted to starts off with a question on April tax seasonality and the NII outlook. So deposits took a decent lie down in the quarter as clients reengage at the pretty consistent industry trend. I\u2019m just curious if tax seasonality is expected to be a little bit more pronounced in 2Q following the changes in the tax law. And maybe just separately was encouraged to hear that the reaffirmation of the loan growth target of mid single-digit year-over-year. I\u2019m just wondering the context of finding yield curve, if we should still -- are you still comfortable with the original guidance of NII growth being up mid single-digit as well?","Jonathan Pruzan","I will go backwards. Yes on both guidance for loan growth and guidance for NII. The loan balances this quarter were down slightly, really being driven by paydowns. We had nice production across the platform. Mortgage as you saw was up. We were impacted by the paydowns in both SBL as well as in tailored. We've had a very nice start to the second quarter. The first two weeks have been very active. Particularly in the SBL product, we surmise that is the result of the tax season this quarter and whether or not we end up in a higher or lower level relative to normal seasonality. But we have clearly seen some very strong production and balances in the SBL product here in the first two weeks. So again, we feel very good about the mid single-digit guidance on loan growth and NII, even though, clearly, expectations around rates and the forward curve are different than when we started the beginning of the year.","Steven Chubak","And just one follow-up for me on some of the fee income drivers in the quarter. And having a look at what your peers have reported, clearly the firm-wide results were quite impressive. I was just wondering if you could provide any inside into how much of that fee strength that we saw in Investment Management, transactional activity in Wealth and other sales and trading is sustainable. And clearly a strong result, I just want to gauge how much of that strength is recurring and what we should be comfortable run rating in our models?","Jonathan Pruzan","The three components on the MSIM, again the fee-based revenue I mentioned, the performance fees and then investments can be lumpy. But investment management should be tracking AUM and AUM growth. And we -- as you saw what happened in those line items, the second one on other sales and trading you mentioned or just other?","James Gorman","We lost him.","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, fees in general, there is -- we feel very good about the results. There wasn't anything particularly unique in the results outside of the Investment Management comments I made about investments being lumpy and the performance fees. We feel very good about the performance. The DCP transactional revenues is the one item. As we called out DCP did impact transactional revenues to the positive. Had it not been further? The reversal of DCP transactional revenues would continue to be soft. A lot of that was the calendar and sort of the defense in posture of our retail clients. So we did see the increase in deposits coming in the December timeframe. We saw that bleed out overtime in the first quarter. And a lot of that went to short-term fixed income product, which has a lower commission schedule. So again, transactional revenues are soft. And we'll have to see how sentiment changes or shifts as the year progresses. But that's one place that I would highlight.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Christian Bolu of Autonomous. Your line is open.","Christian Bolu","So maybe I have a question on expenses and sustainability. Just trying to understand how sustainable the non-comp numbers and wealth management was? So I think 739 for the quarter, which I believe is the lowest since Smith Barney was a quiet, so obviously, very, very strong discipline there. What is that the new normal? Should we just run rate that forward in our models? Or how should we think about the go forward here?","Jonathan Pruzan","Again, it was a nice non-comp quarter. We do have -- in terms of the non-comp, there is obviously some seasonality related to the expenses and FICO and what not. But we've shown extremely good discipline in this business. We made significant technology investments over the course of the last year or two. We'll continue to balance investment and growth in that area. But as James mentioned, this is really a scale business and we have the ability to really manage that expense base tightly. And you're seeing that. So a year-over-year, as you mentioned, it's down 3%, and there wasn't anything chunky or interesting in that other than real discipline and focus.","James Gorman","I would just add two things, Christian. One, more narrowly, just, there will be some integration costs for the Solium. I think the deal is closing in May. Am I right Jon?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure.","James Gorman","There'll be some integration costs with that, some technology investments and so on. Again, I'm not, that's obviously huge given just the size of the business, but that may make down some numbers around a little bit over the next couple of quarters. I don't know exactly, but my guess is a little bit. But more broadly, we came out of last summer and set as the management committee. I think, in September, and just came to a view that the revenue outlook for 2019 did not appear at that point that it was likely to exceed 2018. I think we had an incredible start in '18. We had the two best quarters in our history. And the third quarter was very close to that. We've never broken $10 billion revenue, and we had two in a row and then $9.8 million. And we were right frankly. The fourth quarter turned out to be a disappointing from a revenue perspective. We could see the decline coming. We didn't know how that turnaround would happen. That shutdown appeared imminent and then actually happened. The trade wars were hardening up. It was taking down sentiments. So there was a lot of negativity building through the end of the year. And around September, October, we started taking a hard look at expenses, because you can't change the expenses once you're in the middle of the quarter. It just -- it doesn't work. I mean, there's very little pure discretionary stuff you can just stop. You can stop people traveling around -- going to client stuffs and some, that'll save you a few million bucks. But if you are going to make a real move, you've got to be quite strategic about it. And the teams that are focusing on this September, October, November, even some of that didn't come through till -- where it had started the quarter. It didn't start day one. But there's a whole machine around expense management here, which we've had for a few years that's started with project streamline. And we kind of re-upped that machine again, turned the engines back on and got them going, and they did a great job. So my view is we keep this discipline. I'm not -- the world remains uncertain. I'd love to think the next three quarters are better than the last three quarters of last year. But I'm a betting man, I'm not sure I make that bet right now. The world is uncertain. And until we see more clarity, we're going to be very disciplined. There's not a panic. We -- it's just good smart expense management. 3% decline is not a massive move, but as you saw on the margins on some of these businesses, that really helped. So that's the general philosophy until we get greater visibility and confidence of the outlook is at up outlook year-over-year. We're going to manage entirely.","Christian Bolu","Maybe just switching a bit here, back to I guess, Solium. On more broadly, just broader wealth management of digital wealth management strategy, is there any thought here of building a sort of Merrill Edge-style platform to better serve, as you said, the younger demographic and maybe customers more, more digitally which is one part of the question. And maybe the second part of the Solium question is, are there any revenue dis-synergies we should be aware of? I know that I believe some of your competitors are served by Solium. So I'm not sure if those deals carry over when you close the deal in May?","Jonathan Pruzan","A couple of things, and I'll take a first crack at this. As you know, we've been significantly investing in the digital platforms, both from a client perspective, but also an FA and an operating and an efficiency perspective. And one of the real exciting things about the Solium deal is our ability to use those digital investments more broadly with this younger demographic and this sort of emerging investor, demographic, as people build wealth in the workplace. So we spent significant resources building out, our virtual advisor as well as our access investing, which is a robo platform. So we'll be able to provide digital advice and digital applications to these younger, less affluent customers as they build wealth and then hopefully channel them into the broader FA traditional model that we have. So that's one of the exciting elements of it. And then, in terms of the second part of your question on just to costs or the programs, this is a very exciting space. Employers are looking for full service solutions for their employees, the combination of Solium and their sort of state-of-the-art technology combined with our platform, both on the digital side and the full service, and our ability to deal with things like 401(k) pension benefits, as well as our goals-based planning, our digital platform, and then lastly, financial education and wellness. This is a real interesting, comprehensive product offering for employers. And we would expect the growth to accelerate as we combine these platforms over the next couple, as I said, 12 to 18 months.","James Gorman","I'd just add from a strategic perspective, I mean, it's always fun to talk about new stuff. And a lot of the media attention and sometimes investor attention gets very focused on what's new and sexy and different. And Solium kind of checks all of those boxes. But it's small. I mean, let's be realistic here. I mean, it's a -- I think it's a very interesting strategic play that will play out over a number of years and puts us squarely in the space we want to be in, but at a small. We have a $17 billion revenue business in Wealth Management that has nothing to do with Solium right now. That is the main game, driving the margins in that business, shifting the assets on to new types of platforms, building out the banks and lending products. They are the massive moves that are going to take place over the next several years. I think the wealth management for our Asia platform is very important as that continues to grow. So I just -- I don't want to dampen the enthusiasm. I just want to put in context that to win in workplace and losing the advisory would not be a good answer. Our job is to win in the advisory, crush that and add these other verticals as opportunities permit and opportunity opened and we took it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Devin Ryan","Since the last quarter you guys talked quite a bit about M&A opportunities. And Solium was announced soon after that, and maybe some foreshadowing there. I'm just curious if you're still actively looking for opportunistic M&A here whether it would be DWM or asset management? And last quarter, you'd also mentioned potentially pursuing some new client segments. I'm just trying to think about what some of those segments could be? Are there any specific areas that are maybe more attractive today?","James Gorman","We have a very high bar on M&A. It's how they got to bring scale to an existing business. It's got to be an area of where we have clay competencies or it's got to be something which fills out is complementary to our platform might and give us scale, but fills out and broadens our platform. I think where you saw, it Mesa West is a good example of that. What you saw with Solium is a good example of that. What you saw at Smith Barney was a good example of pure scale play. So yes, we're looking opportunities, but we're very, I don't know if conservative is the word, but we're definitely not compulsively trying to buy stuff. That's not where I hit is that. On the other hand, as we see things that we think is smart and can fit on the platform and culturally good fit, we'll go for it. Jon do you want to add to that?","Jonathan Pruzan","No. I think your focus is right in terms of both Wealth and IM. Sort of more of the fee-based type businesses, less balance sheet intensive, and that's really what the focus has been. And that's what the two deals we saw over the last few years were.","Devin Ryan ","So just a follow-up here on Wealth Management. I know there are a number of growth initiatives there today and a number that are kind of beyond adding financial advisors. But you've actually had a slight increase in advisor headcount over the past three quarters. I know it's small. But can you maybe talk about the backdrop for financial advisor recruiting, if there's been any change in kind of appetite there or maybe attractiveness of recruiting, especially, with some of the expense rolling off from the Smith Barney retention and other employee loans amortizing?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. I mean, I think, first and foremost, I would just say one of this has been less movement of people both in and out and that's good for stability of the platform, the ability to build relationships and continue to invest, so that's a positive. You did mention, I think, recruiting, last year was quite slow for us as we focused on digital and adoption and things of that nature. I think we have a very attractive platform. So we're seeing interest in joining our platforms. So there could be some marginal pickup in that area. But that's not really going to be a growth engine for us. And I would say one thing that I call that in the script is, the numbers will go up and down in terms of headcount. I think productivity is critically important. And you've seen us to increase the productivity of the average advisor, quite consistently over the timeframe. So we're happy with that. But just less movement of people, broadly speaking is better. James mentioned, we saw the roll-off of the retention notes. We did actually see an uptick. But again, these are not big numbers in uptick and retirements. But they were sort of well planned for. As you know, most advisors now work in teams, and we've gotten a very good program in place to help them transition their book of business to a younger member of their team and continue to retain those assets, even though people are leaving the business or retiring. So we feel very good about the stability of where we are right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Lim of Societe Generale. Your line is open.","Andrew Lim","So I just had a follow on from the question asked earlier, perhaps if you give some color on the other revenues within the Institutional Securities, you've referenced smart market gains associated with corporate lending activity. It's just due to spread tightening. How feasible is it to expect more that's going forward? Or is it just a reversal of some spread lining that we still in the 4Q? And then the second question is on CLOs and average lending. It's a question that asked one of your competitors. But I was wondering if you've seen any changes in Japanese buyers for CLOs, U.S. CLOs, especially the highly rated stuff regarding changes to Japanese regulations, a few weeks ago, which have required CLO issuers to have 5% risk attention?","Jonathan Pruzan","Sure. And again, I think the -- I'll try and take those questions separately. The other revenues, there's a lot of things that are moving around. And those three lines, other revenues, other sales and trading, investments, I think you have to look at the broadly in context and then we try to call out what we think the biggest drivers of the changes are. And other sales and trading, this quarter, you see some of the impact of the deferred comps that we talked about. We also saw that's where we have a lot of our hedging activity, and obviously, spreads tighten, so there were losses there on the flip side and the other revenue line. We have the mark-to-market on those same positions. And so those just generally had been offsetting each other. So again, there's a lot of moving parts in those businesses, and we've tried to -- excuse me, in those line items. And we've tried to call out the main differences. On the CLOs, as you mentioned, the risk retention rules are new. We haven't seen a big change in behavior issuance in the first quarter. It was down slightly in terms of CLOs versus where they were last quarter last year, but it was certainly healthy. Our expectation is given the pricing dynamic more than the risk retention rules. We're given the pricing dynamic. We'd expect CLO issuance to decline year-over-year, but it's been pretty healthy in the first quarter, and it's supporting a pretty healthy leverage loan market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matt O'Connor","Good trends in the compensation down 5% year-over-year. I guess I would have thought there might have been even more flexibility just given some of the roll-off of the retention and then also some of the pull-forward that you did in 4Q. Obviously, we're just looking at one quarter here, and you're optimistic on the revenue outlook. But just talk about some of those dynamics and the flexibility you have, specifically in comp, and layer the retention and the roll-off -- sorry, and the front ending of some compensation in 4Q?","Jonathan Pruzan","I'll try to take that in the two components. On the ISG side, you saw the comp ratios sort of consistent with last year's first quarter. Revenues were down, so obviously comp was impacted by that. And we continue to believe or continue to manage that tightly. We want to be competitive in compensation and retain and attract the best people and we think we have the flexibility to do that within the context of the of the comp ratio in that business. On the Wealth side, if you look at year-over-year, there was very little change in the comp ratio. You're right, the retention did roll off. And as I mentioned also, the DCP or the deferred comp plan is just the movement that we've called out in the transactional revenues. While it's dilutive to the PBT margin, it's actually accretive to the comp. Its revenue margin, because we're pulling out high comp revenue dollars to the revenues when we backed that out. So the comp ratio would have been actually down, had it not been down, had it not been for the movements in the DCP. We did roll off those notes in the first quarter. But if again, comparing year-over-year, we've been investing in the business, and in terms of both people and comp levels. But again, if you were to backup the DCP, you'd see a more start decline.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Al Alevizakos of HSBC. Your line is open.","Alevizos Alevizakos","It's a strategic question regarding your technology investment, especially given that you've already locked into acquisitions like Solium Capital. I remember that you previously disclosed the $4 billion budget for technology. And I was wondering how do you think about it for 2018 given that the revenue backdrop is slightly lower. At the same time, you've already done an acquisition for close of $1 billion. So will that remain the same go higher, go lower? And how much did you spend for changing the bank? Thank you.","James Gorman","I'm not sure I want to get into great detail about the technology budget. I wouldn't expect it to change materially year-over-year, probably the mix is changing a little bit. We're moving into some of the more innovative areas of technology, and we've made a major push with our cyber defense. We have -- doing a lot of work around machine learning at the moment, Big data management, so all the stuff that you would expect us to be doing. We're doing. I think we spent a lot of money getting regulatory compliance in the last five, eight years from a technology perspective. And once you're complained, you're complained, you don't have to keep spending that. So and we made a lot of changes to the Wealth Management platform, the user interface from the various tools the advisors have at their workplace. And once you've done that, you don't have to keep doing it at the same pace. So I think, if I was sitting in front of one of your models, I would probably be modeling more or less flat. And within that there's a change in mix going on. We're -- it's easy just to throw back at some money at technology. It's something -- because people are talking about it so much. It's very fashionable to do that. And we're also running a business. So I think we want to find the right balance.","Alevizos Alevizakos","And as a follow-up on something you said just before, you mentioned that you would only be considering to do acquisitions or investments that they would actually add scale to your business. And clearly, Investment Management, I think is one of the places where you are subscale compared to some of your competitors. And there was a rumor on Bloomberg, last month that you may be looking for a large German wealth asset manager? Would that make any sense from a strategic perspective? Thank you.","James Gorman","Well, one, I don't comment on rumors. Two, I didn't even see the article. Three, I think the probability of us investing in a European wealth management given that we sold our European wealth management business a few years ago is somewhere between zero and none. But apart from that, I don\u2019t want to comment on the rumor. It's not just scale. We look at scale as clearly to me, the easiest acquisition is where you building sale economics. But we look at products and capabilities fill in. That's just as important as if we're going to grow, we can't just rely upon getting deep from what we're doing. We've also got to expand the range of things we're doing. I think that's exactly. Jon may have a comment on this. That's exactly what we did in the asset management space. I think what Dan Simkowitz and his team is focused on Jon.","Jonathan Pruzan","Yes. And again, I would look at the asset management space. It's not necessarily in totality. If you look at the different products that were in, the equity products, the fixed income products, the alternative products, there are certain businesses that we feel that we're very effective and are at scale. And we'd like to continue to add little product or product capabilities, Mesa West in the Equity product in terms of commercial real estate, excuse me, the debt products in commercial real estate was one area that we like to fill in. I would say, in fixed income, we would probably like to see more scale in that business. We continue to make key hires and invest for public and private credit, and will continue to do that. We try to build out that business. But I would tell you the other businesses within asset management when we do that scale.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"15107":["Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 18, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Celeste Mellet Brown - Managing Director","James P.

This is Celeste Brown, Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements, which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The presentation may also include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings at morganstanley.com for reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures, and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley. This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument.","I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.","James P. Gorman","Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Celeste. Our results and actions this quarter evidence progress and important milestones towards our long-term strategic plan, a plan we laid out for all of you several years ago. In addition to executing on the long-term strategy, we also remain nimble and have demonstrated our ability to adjust tactically.","A key to our future is increased contribution of Wealth Management to our revenue, profitability, returns and funding stability. This quarter, we continued to move forward in 2 ways. First, on the tactical front. Our margin progress, at 13% pretax margin excluding nonrecurring expenses, provides increasing support of the strategy. Second, and of greater long-term significance, we purchased 14% of the Wealth Management joint venture, while locking in the price and greater flexibility for the remaining 35%. We're pleased to have clarity about our future and are closer to recognizing the full value of Global Wealth Management for the firm and for our shareholders, value that goes beyond the short-term margin targets.","In addition, the revenue and profit contribution of MSIM, our Asset Management business, really rounds out the wealth and asset management side of the firm. Also key to our future obviously is our long-term strategy in ISG, which continues to reinforce an integrated business that best delivers for clients, leverages our historic strengths, while optimizing capital. Again, on the tactical front, our objective this quarter was to demonstrate a recovery from the challenging second quarter, though acknowledging seasonality. This was most clear in our Fixed Income results, which rebounded sharply even with the continued drag from CVA due to the tightening of our credit spreads. As discussed on our last earnings call, clients did reengage with us at the end of the second quarter and continued to do so throughout the third quarter.","Evidence of progress across the firm towards our long-term strategy is our strong Basel III capital ratio, which is now north of 9% as of September 30. We've accomplished a lot over the last several years to position this firm well for the future and the new regulatory landscape. We have great confidence we'll translate this value into greater profitability for our shareholders and drive returns higher through sensible capital actions at the appropriate time.","Now I'm going to turn it over to Ruth to take you through our earnings in detail. Thank you.","Ruth Porat","Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures.","DVA in the quarter was a loss of $2.3 billion with $1.6 billion in Fixed Income sales and trading and $641 million in Equity sales and trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were $7.6 billion, up 14% sequentially. Noninterest expense was $6.8 billion, up 13% versus the second quarter. Compensation expense was $3.9 billion this quarter. Noncompensation expense was $2.8 billion, up 19% from last quarter, reflecting nonrecurring expenses associated with the Global Wealth Management integration, as well as higher litigation costs. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the third quarter was 35.4%.","Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were approximately $535 million. Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were $0.28 after preferred dividends. On a reported or GAAP basis, firm-wide revenues for the quarter were $5.3 billion. Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were a loss of $1 billion. Reported earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were a loss of $0.55 after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was $30.53 per share. Tangible book value was $26.65 per share, reflecting a reduction of $0.58 related to the increased 14% ownership stake in the Wealth Management joint venture.","Turning to the balance sheet. Our total assets were $765 billion at September 30, up from $749 billion last quarter. Our liquidity reserve was $170 billion at the end of the quarter versus $173 billion last quarter. Deposits were $71 billion, up again this quarter. Although our calculations are not final, we believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I will be approximately 13.7% and our Tier 1 capital ratio will be approximately 16.7%. Risk-weighted assets under Basel I are expected to be approximately $319 billion at September 30. Subject to final rule-making, our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was north of 9% as of the end of the third quarter, assuming full Basel III inflation of risk-weighted assets and 0 benefit from future mitigation.","Let me now discuss our business in detail. In Institutional Securities, revenues, excluding DVA, were $3.6 billion, up 26% sequentially. Noninterest expense was $3.3 billion, up 21% versus the second quarter. Compensation was $1.6 billion for the third quarter, reflecting a 45% ratio, excluding DVA. Noncompensation expense increased 27% from last quarter due to higher litigation costs of approximately $280 million. The business reported a pretax profit of $345 million, excluding the impact of DVA. Including the impact of DVA, the business reported a pretax loss of $1.9 billion.","In Investment Banking, revenues of $969 million were up 10% versus last quarter. According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked #1 in global IPOs, #2 in global announced M&A, #3 in global equity and #4 in U.S. dollar investment-grade debt at the end of the third quarter. Notable transactions included, in equity underwriting, the $8.5 billion global IPO of Japan Airlines, which marked the second-largest IPO globally this year and the largest airline float in history. This transaction is also a great example of the power of our partnership with MUFG. In advisory, Porsche SE transferred the remaining 50.1% stake in Porsche AG to Volkswagen valued at $8.9 billion. And in debt underwriting, Blackstone's $650 million offering, its first-ever 30-year bond issuance and its largest debt offering to date.","Advisory revenues of $339 million were up 29% versus the second quarter, with increased revenues in all regions. Equity underwriting revenues were $199 million, a 30% decrease from the second quarter. Although equity underwriting volumes for the industry were up sequentially, they were more heavily weighted toward follow-on offerings and block deals versus IPOs in the second quarter.","Fixed income underwriting revenues of $431 million were up 28% versus last quarter, reflecting increased revenue in high yield and investment-grade issuance, as well as stronger loan syndication fees. Equity sales and trading revenue, excluding DVA, were $1.2 billion, an increase of 7% from last quarter. Derivatives revenues improved despite seasonality due to a combination of more favorable market conditions and expansion of our client footprint.","Prime brokerage revenues increased modestly despite reduced average hedge fund leverage in the quarter. Hedge fund leverage picked up at the end of the quarter and continues to increase. Revenues in cash equities were consistent with last quarter despite significantly reduced levels of market activity globally. Results were supported by share gains across most markets.","Fixed Income and Commodities sales and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were $1.5 billion. Revenues were up 89% versus our second quarter results. Revenues increased across most of our businesses. CVA, net of hedges, was negative again this quarter due to the tightening of our credit spreads. Year-to-date in rates, we have generated almost as much revenue as we did in the entirety of 2011. In foreign exchange, we delivered our best reported quarter since 2009. Within our credit businesses, we had particular strength in our Securitized Products business. Commodities results benefited from more favorable market conditions. Other sales and trading reflects negative revenues of $164 million compared with negative $11 million last quarter.","Turning to VAR. We implemented a new VAR model this quarter, which we have been running in parallel since 2011. Our new VAR model has been approved by regulators. The benefit of the new model is that it is more responsive to current market conditions, while also maintaining longer-term perspective. The new model is aligned with Basel 2.5 requirements. In our supplement, we provided VAR measures under both our current and previous VAR model for this quarter, the prior quarter and the prior year, and we will do the same for the fourth quarter. Our average trading VAR for the third quarter was $63 million versus $76 million in the second quarter and $99 million in the prior year.","Turning to Global Wealth Management. Revenues of $3.3 billion were flat to the prior quarter. Asset Management revenues were down modestly versus the prior quarter, reflecting lower market levels at June 30. Transaction revenues increased 6% from last quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $521 million, which decreased 2% from last quarter, reflecting lower equity volume. Investment Banking-related fees of $199 million, which decreased 11% versus last quarter, driven by a slower equity issuance calendar and trading revenues of $312 million, which were up 41% versus the second quarter, reflecting strong fixed income secondary trading, as well as markups in our deferred compensation plans.","Noninterest expense was $3.1 billion, up 6% from last quarter. Expenses included nonrecurring items of approximately $193 million related to the integration and the purchase of the 14% stake in the joint venture. The compensation ratio was 61% versus 60% in the second quarter. Noncompensation expense was $1 billion, up 14% versus last quarter. Excluding the nonrecurring expenses associated with the joint venture, the PBT margin was 13%. On a reported basis, the PBT margin was 7%, with profit before tax of $239 million.","Total client assets increased to $1.8 trillion, reflecting the benefit of higher equity markets and positive flows. Global fee-based asset inflows were $8 billion, fee-based assets under management increased to $556 billion at quarter end. Global representatives were 16,829. Bank deposits were $118 billion, with approximately $60 billion held in Morgan Stanley banks.","Asset Management revenues of $631 million were up from $456 million in the second quarter, due primarily to principal investment gains in Merchant Banking and Real Estate. In Traditional Asset Management, revenues of $372 million were up 10% compared to the second quarter due to higher market levels. In Real Estate Investing, revenues of $125 million were flat versus last quarter. Due to the ownership structure of these funds, the majority of these revenues are passed to third-party investors in the noncontrolling interest line.","In Merchant Banking, revenues were $134 million compared with negative $3 million in the second quarter driven primarily by principal investment gains. Compensation expense was $241 million in the quarter, up slightly from $214 million in the second quarter. Profit before tax was $198 million, up from $43 million last quarter. NCI was $50 million versus $23 million last quarter. Total assets under management increased to $331 billion driven by net inflows of $11 billion and market appreciation.","Turning to our outlook. We continue to see momentum in our businesses based on better market conditions and the strategic positioning of the firm. With respect to the market, both institutional and retail investor activity picked up on the back of the ECB's bold moves in August. We believe the ECB's actions reduced the probability of a tail risk event in Europe, although challenges remain in Europe and globally.","With respect to the firm's businesses, clients clearly reengaged with us post the ratings decision in late June and continued to do so throughout the third quarter. We saw a recovery in our Fixed Income results and continue to benefit from our cohesive sales and trading businesses. Investment Banking volumes industry-wide remain muted relative to historic levels, but pipelines are healthy. With our strong market share, we are well positioned if the fledgling economic recovery in the U.S. persists and market stability in Europe is sustained. We are increasingly benefiting from our Wealth Management business, including the advantages of being on one platform as well as our increased stake in the business. We are also yielding results from our alliance with MUFG with powerful market share gains in Japanese and cross-border M&A.","We continue to take the steps needed to realize cost savings through headcount reductions and cost-cutting, setting us up well for 2013 and 2014. Specifically, by the end of the third quarter, we were close to our headcount reduction goal for all of 2012. Our Office of Re-engineering remains on track to achieve $500 million run rate savings this year and $1.4 billion by 2014. And the results of our cost initiatives in GWM are increasingly visible now that we are on one platform.","Looking forward, we remain confident about our path to ROE expansion based on the revenue, profitability and capital strategies we have implemented. Most notably, in Institutional Securities, we have leading global businesses with momentum across the platform enhanced by capital optimization. In Wealth Management, we are already benefiting from our increased ownership both because we are earning a return on the capital held against the 14% and the growing deposit base, which will drive funding efficiency and revenue expansion. Because of these and other steps we have taken, as well as the early signs of an improving macro environment, we look forward to the future.","Thank you for listening. And James and I will now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You both mentioned the impact of the CVA this quarter. Can you tell us how meaningful that was? And were there any hedges against that as I think is your historical practice?","Ruth Porat","So there were hedges against it as is our historical practice and as we disclosed in our filings. And the drag -- just to try and help you size it, the drag from CVA this quarter was bigger than the period-specific items we called out last quarter in our Fixed Income business. In addition, we had a drag in equities, although it was smaller than in Fixed Income.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then, James, could you just update us on your long-term strategy vision for the Commodities business and how you see both the physical and the nonphysical segments of the business fitting within the regulatory framework as we go forward?","James P. Gorman","Well, Commodities has been a great business here at Morgan Stanley for a long time. It continues to be an attractive business. Obviously, with the Dodd-Frank legislation, there are potential limits to some of the activities that we can pursue in that business. So it's incumbent upon us to explore all forms of different structures, appropriate structures, that can take us forward, where we can get the benefits of the business but also meet the regulatory constraints that we operate under.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on capital management, James, you've highlighted in the past to think about this capital management and capital trends as sequential process. So sequentially, you've retired legacy issues, you've bought the first 15% of the buy-in, crystallized the price for the rest and this Basel III Tier 1 common continues to improve. So where we are now, how do you think about the potential ability to buy back your stock, restore the dividend and\/or maybe do the rest of the buy-in?","James P. Gorman","Well, it's a good question, Howard. Obviously, we have CCAR process that we and the other financial institutions go through with our regulators, both Federal Reserve and the other regulators. And in that process, one is in a position to pursue a range of capital actions. The process is now conducted twice yearly. Last couple of years, it's been once yearly. So there are opportunities going forward to put in place whatever plans we have in place. We've made it pretty clear that our major strategic objective is to complete the acquisition of MSSB, of which we have remaining 35%. And that would have a very modest capital implication for us, given the agreed-upon price and the goodwill we already hold against the position. So I don't want to get ahead of ourselves and don't want to get ahead of our regulators. We'll address what and when other actions as we get to the CCAR process in January of next year.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. That makes sense. And just finally for me, you noted the heightened litigation costs this quarter. What specifically did those relate to, Ruth? And how far would you say we are through crisis and postcrisis litigation for the firm?","Ruth Porat","Well, it covered -- this quarter covered a number of items, including the recent decision in one matter but also expenses associated with other ongoing matters. And I think, as you put it, litigation has been an ongoing cost for the industry. And I think it will continue to be.","Operator","The next question will come from Roger Freeman with Barclays.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just going back to, I think, probably a couple of things Howard asked. Besides sort of the CCAR process, are there other things with respect to buying in the rest of the JV that factor into your decision-making? And what would cause you to accelerate that or not, separate from the capital allocation?","James P. Gorman","Well, I'll have a go, then Ruth can jump in. We agreed on a fixed price on the JV. And given that fixed price, the capital -- and you can do the math on it -- the capital implications of buying the rest of it are pretty modest. There are many advantages to pursuing that, obviously, but again we've got to go through the CCAR process and make sure it's the right time to do it. But there are advantages to pursue it and we've made that very clear. This is a strategic imperative.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then just maybe tied to that broadly, you've got to a 13% pretax margin, excluding the charges. Your target next year is mid-teens. Can you just remind us what other milestones we'd be looking for? I mean, you're obviously close to that number now. Does this continue to, as you model it out, rise over the course of next year, so you're at a higher level, above mid-teens by the end of next year?","Ruth Porat","So we're still guiding to mid-teens margin mid-next year, but 2 components I think to your question. First is we're looking forward to the fourth quarter and beyond a couple of items. One, integration expense is running lower post the second quarter. As we've talked about it, ran kind of the $80 million to $100 million per quarter area in the first half, and then we had budgeted for it to come down in the third and fourth quarters, which it did, running at lower levels, and then dropped off again next year. So the third quarter margin did benefit from that drop in integration expense, which will also benefit the fourth quarter, and then it goes down in 2013. The second thing is that we'll have a full quarter of the expense benefit associated with the charge that we took in the third quarter. We had 2 of 3 months' benefit in the third quarter. So there was some impact on the 13% margin this quarter. We get the full 3 months' benefit next quarter. Obviously, we are always careful to say that PBT margin expansion is not a straight line. For example, in the fourth quarter, we do tend to have seasonally higher expenses. But it's too soon to tell. And then I think as we look forward, and really building on James' comment about the upside, whenever it comes with the additional 35%, when we buy that in, first and foremost, we generate earnings on this capital that we're already holding against Citi's stakes. So that meaningfully improves ROE in the business. But in addition to that, we get the benefit from adding about another $55 billion in deposits over time. So not only do we benefit from efficient stable funding, but we also increase net interest income, which is higher-margin. And then beyond NCI, there's an earnings benefit from trading volumes that are now directed to Citi based on an order flow agreement. That's eliminated when we own 100%. So some contractual benefits that take it higher, and then there are certain other costs from managing a joint venture that drop away. So mid-teens margin mid-next year is the guidance, but I just wanted to give you the path forward.","Roger A. Freeman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then just lastly, on the Basel III Tier 1 ratio, 9%. The last quarter, I think you said you were just under 8.5%. There was some benefit from the MSSB transaction. But also is the 8.5% still a comparable number? Because I know the NPR had just come out in June. And so I don't know if there were any revisions to the historical look-back.","Ruth Porat","Yes. That's a comparable number. The increase really starts with earnings, and as you know well, DVA is not relevant for the capital calculation. So starting with earnings, there was a modest benefit from the new VAR model. But I think, very important, we continue to execute on our RWA plan, the risk-weighted asset plan.","Operator","Your next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Can you update us on your FICC risk-weighted asset reduction? How much have you done? And how much more do you have to go?","Ruth Porat","Mike, given we just laid it out at a conference recently, what I'll say is we're very much on track for the targets that we laid out at the conference.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. The increase in your Basel III Tier 1 ratio, was that helped out this quarter by the risk-weighted asset reduction? Or is that to come? And also did the VAR change help out your capital ratio?","Ruth Porat","Yes. The 3 components that helped the capital ratio was obviously starting with earnings, and then I just mentioned that there was a modest benefit from the new VAR model. And yes, we did continue to execute on the RWA plan, that was part of the benefit.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And why did you make the change in the VAR model? Was it simply to get a shorter time series? And if so, what time frame did you have before versus now?","Ruth Porat","Yes. The primary driver was to have a VAR model that's more sensitive to changes in market volatility. So it is more weighted to 1 year data. As we've talked about in the past, our prior VAR model was really -- it was based on 4-year data. And we've been running this model and the prior model in parallel since 2011, which gives us a high level of comfort from the model. It's been approved by regulators. It is consistent with Basel requirements. And in our disclosure, what you've probably seen is we've provided the VAR measures under both models for this quarter, the prior quarter, the prior year. And we will be doing the same for the fourth quarter. I thought it would be helpful for you to be able to see the trends under both models, which are the same, VAR was down this quarter.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And you can appreciate the idea of changing a VAR model gets people's attention these days. Is there anything else you've looked out at, given what's taken place recently elsewhere in putting in place a new VAR model? I mean, you've put it in place firm-wide, you've ran it in parallel for, what, 1.5 years. Anything else you can say to assure people?","Ruth Porat","Sure. So first and foremost, it's part of the overall governance around risk management where you have one centralized risk organization. It reports to the board risk committee. The risk organization built the model. It's been thoroughly vetted internally and, as I said, approved by regulators. We've been running both models in parallel for an extended period of time. And the other point is that VAR is just one of multiple measures of risk we use to assess overall risk in the organization. So we've talked in the past about our proprietary stress VAR model. That captures a longer time series and market liquidity and tail risk. And we do constant scenario modeling with stresses for volatility and price changes. So it's part of an overall to your point, very good question, overall comprehensive risk management, centralized risk management organization with multiple tools.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then last question. In Wealth Management, now that you're on one platform, I imagine you had many people working on that integration. You said you're at your headcount reduction already. So how many people were working on that integration? And I guess, they'll be redeployed for more external activities or elsewhere. What kind of additional synergies can you get now that the integration is finally done?","Ruth Porat","So as I indicated, the expenses were higher in the first half but didn't drop off completely in the third and fourth quarter because we've continued to provide support. We had built that into our upfront plan. So you're right. I don't have the numbers with me, but headcount does benefit modestly as we completed the platform and will continue to benefit.","Operator","The next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","A quickie on loan. Loan commitments have been coming down. They're actually down like in half. Is that a function of the environment or a little more a function of the Basel III Dodd-Frank world that we're going to live in?","Ruth Porat","So loans -- what I'd like to point you to is obviously the difference between what's in our fair value block versus HFI. As we've talked about several quarters ago, we were increasingly moving to HFI. That is up again this quarter. And overall, our loan book is actually up this quarter. So I think the change is in what's fair value versus HFI, HFI is now over half of our total loan book.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","A totally fair point. I guess, M&A performance is pretty good. But in general, industry-wide, you scratch your head, you look back and you say, \"Well, conditions actually should be pretty good for a heated M&A environment,\" yet I think there's a lot of conversations, good pipelines and not a lot of trigger-pulling. I'm just not sure if you can think through the things that would maybe break up that log jam and what your expectations are next 4 or 5 quarters.","Ruth Porat","You're absolutely right. Our view is that the conditions that we're seeing today with lower volatility in the markets and low rates, so an attractive financing environment, if you look historically, that should set up for a -- or encourage a pretty robust M&A environment, pretty -- higher levels of activity. And very much to your point, industry-wide volumes continue to remain at very low levels. What we're hearing anecdotally is that much of that continues to be the uncertainty about the environment. Some concern, not just in Europe, but increasingly here in the U.S. and that, that is basically putting activity kind of on the sidelines. Conversation's ongoing and the pipeline's healthy, but very much to your point, need to have more clarity about the environment and some of the changes that are forthcoming, in particular, here in the U.S. for activity to move forward in a meaningful way is our expectation.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Excellent. And last one, just more of a big picture one, I think everything you pointed out at the beginning of the call is spot-on. I think Fixed Income snapped back strong. M&A, debt underwriting, Equity is all good, Wealth Management getting better, we're going to own more. Even if you do the math of you owning more and hitting your margin target, I'm still coming up in a single-digit ROE range. And I just don't know if it's just waiting on a better environment. I'm just curious if you, in your minds, have a path towards, say, a double-digit ROE and what it takes to get there.","Ruth Porat","Sure. We do have meaningful ROE upside and are unequivocally focused on driving returns in each of our businesses. There was noise in the numbers this quarter. I'll let you model those in. But taking you to the sustainably higher ROE and focusing on those drivers we've talked about, revenue profitability, capital efficiency for the various businesses -- let me go into them in some detail. So in Wealth Management, in terms of the revenue upside, we're continuing to increase our managed accounts business. It's up above $550 billion this quarter, it's up 20% year-over-year. And that's accretive to returns. And we are increasing our lending business. We have $73 billion of deposits as of October 15 once the deposits came in from Citi associated with the 14% stake. Those come in under the drag basis -- lag basis, rather. So $73 billion of deposits, we're increasingly moving that to higher-margin products, which will increase NIM, even without any rate increase. And then on the expense side, you've seen it in the third quarter. The integration is complete, so expenses have come down and have more room to go, as I just noted. And the cost savings programs add to that even more. And then on the capital side, as you said, when we own -- as we increasingly own more of the joint venture, we generate earnings on what I have repeatedly called deadweight capital. We're holding this capital against Citi's stake and not earning -- generating earnings on it. Notably, as we buy-in the remainder of the Wealth Management joint venture, there is contractually significant revenue and profitability upsides that I commented on, things like the order flow agreement, a limit, more deposits -- so more upside beyond that contractually. And then on the Institutional Securities side, starting with revenues, we have sizable operating leverage in our institutional businesses, and we're executing on our plan. So we have a stellar platform in banking, we have a strong M&A pipeline. The same is true for equity new issuance, and both really played to our strengths. We have a leading franchise in institutional equities, and we continue to increase share even with low volumes, low market-wide volumes. And on Fixed Income, we're on track to running an optimized returns business with a strong client franchise, putting risk behind clients with smart capital efficiency. And we're pleased with the momentum in the business. On expenses, we now have very strong expense controls, comp and noncomp. And on capital, we're benefiting from more efficient use of capital across the businesses. On top of that, there would be upside from any return of capital and from an improving market over time. But we're building to a healthy increase in ROE with the revenue profitability and capital levers I've just gone through.","James P. Gorman","Hey, Glenn, it's James. You said at the beginning what an overall big picture on the ROE, and as Ruth just laid out all the components. But just step back for a minute. The first quarter, the ROE was 9%. Second quarter, obviously, we fell into a hole with the rating agency action, and there is -- clearly, we wanted to demonstrate that we've bounced back from that, which I think we have clear demonstration. You put all the pieces together, and it's not a terribly heroic assumption to get back to your cost of capital. And that's clearly what our plan and focus is on. We will be very, very, very focused on noncomp expenses. We are very attentive to our overall capital plan over the next couple of years. We're determined to make this GWM acquisition work. And as Ruth said, we have huge operating leverage across Institutional Securities. So again, I'm not sure what your math is looking like, but I don't think it takes a lot of heroic assumptions to get you to a reasonable ROE number. And then obviously from then on, as the global macro environment improves, which I believe it is on the starting basis of doing, we take it up from that point.","Operator","The next question will come from Kian Abouhossein with JPMorgan.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question is relating to risk-weighted assets again. You mentioned at a recent conference, second quarter group risk-weighted assets were about $500 billion. Could you give us an update where we stand as of the third quarter with a 9% Tier 1 Basel III?","Ruth Porat","Given we just went through it at a recent conference, we're continuing to execute on the RWA plan. But I don't have it with me because we're not updating it at this point.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When will you give actually more details on your Basel III? Because it's been industry standard to start give a little bit more details. When should we expect you actually to either have it in the press release or in any other form that you give more details on capital as well as Basel III details?","Ruth Porat","Well, actually, I think that with the delineation we gave, and in particular in Fixed Income, we've given quite a bit of granularity because we wanted to make it clear how we're thinking about this strategically. And we've laid out some pretty key milestones. I think it might be helpful if I roll forward based on that plan where that gets you in '13. And you've probably already done this. But based on our current interpretation of the rules, consensus earnings and the RWA reduction plan that we did lay out at the conference, the math will get you to north of 10% by 2013.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Moving on to funding cost. Your funding cost is about 50 to 100 basis points higher than your peers. And I'm looking at your balance sheet, and you have about $170 billion of long-term debt. But I'm sure there's other long-term debt that I'm missing because of the way it's categorized. How much long-term debt do you actually have or what you categorize as long-term debt in your business? And how does a 50 to 100 basis points higher CDS spread impact your funding cost really going forward? How should we think about how you fund your business and the impact on the ROE?","Ruth Porat","So you've identified the long-term debt. You've got the right number there. In terms of funding, as I've said on many quarterly calls, the strategic moves that we've been making are benefiting our funding costs and our requirements. So for example, the growth of the deposit base, which is fairly consistent with our ongoing growth of the Wealth Management business funds both our corporate and retail loan books and additional products in the bank. And as we increase funding with deposits, we reduce reliance on our unsecured funding. With respect to the business mix, as we move more toward flow, which we've talked about quarter-after-quarter from structured products, we're funding more efficiently through the secured channel. And as a result of this and all that we've been doing with the balance sheet, this quarter alone, our unsecured debt is down by $3 billion. In 2012 year-to-date, it's down by about $20 billion. So in the aggregate, as a result of the strategic move, which is why I keep anchoring it back to that, the strategy is actually yielding multiple benefits. We've reduced our funding requirements, we've increased the durability of our funding because we have more efficiency given the multiple funding sources.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's actually quite useful. And in terms of the comp ratio, I get to an IB-clean comp of 45% in the quarter. You mentioned noncomp as an improvement area. Most banks that I talk to are looking at more like high 30s as a comp target over the medium-term. How do you see your long-term comp ratio outlook, assuming no material changes in revenues?","Ruth Porat","Understood. So in recent quarters with higher revenues, we've delivered a lower compensation ratio, which evidences our philosophy and continues to drive returns. And as we've said many times, we're focused on appropriately rewarding those who drive returns while improving ROE and earnings. So it's not just about compensation dollars. We're also looking at headcount management, at location sourcing, at the overall expense management program and looking at both comp and noncomp.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But with this revenue environment, is it fair to say we should still see low 40s as a number on comp? Is it reasonable?","Ruth Porat","Well, I was going to make 2 points. The other important point to note is obviously ratios are not apples-to-apples across the Street. And as I said, we're looking at ensuring that we get the balance right so that we can reward those who drive returns while improving ROE.","Kian Abouhossein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And last question on your VAR model. Do you still use a Monte Carlo model or historic now?","Ruth Porat","Historic.","Operator","The next question will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have a follow-up question, I guess, to Glenn's question about the businesses and getting to ROE, Ruth. And maybe you incorporated your comments on this, but you didn't really focus on the Asset Management businesses. You're currently running at about a 17% ROE this quarter, about half of that on a year-to-date basis. Is there any meaningful benefit to ROE given the relatively modest contribution now that you see? You mentioned ISG and you mentioned Wealth Management. But is there anything that we might expect in terms of ROE benefit from Asset Management in the next year or 2?","Ruth Porat","Well, you've identified, given it's already a high ROE business, yes, there tends to be less of a question there. What we've consistently been doing is bringing back C capital [ph] and investing in the core business. And so again, that's accretive to returns in what's already an attractive return business.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned that there's been some greater sense of engagement from your clients post the Moody's downgrade and that accelerated in the third quarter. My presumption is that, that is a comment basically focused on your institutional clients. Can you give us a little more color as to the sense of the retail investor engagement over the course of the third quarter? And any color you might want to provide relative to what's happened since the end of the quarter.","Ruth Porat","If I'm hearing the question correctly, there were actually almost -- maybe 2 points in there. Post-Moody's, we had -- we saw clients really reengaging, as you said, in the sales and trading side, in particular, on the Fixed Income side, which is the area that dealt with it the most. There wasn't really a Moody's impact on the retail side. And so on the retail side, the focus has been much more about what's going on in the macro environment. And as I commented, one of the impacts and the drags in the business has been, with the macro as weak as it had been or as volatile as it had been, we had lower levels industry-wide of equity new issue products. So that affected the opportunity overall for retail products to go through the system. But I think what you see in retail, which is attractive, is the consistency of revenues quarter-after-quarter.","James P. Gorman","I would just add from observing that part of the business for over a decade that there are periods where retail investors are completely disinterested in the market. There are periods when they're chasing everything that's moving. And then there are periods when they're basically sitting on the sidelines. If a good product comes along, they engage. If there's a better tone in the market, they engage. And we are in that period. We're definitely not in a fearful period. We're in a period where the money is there, the flows are still positive, a lot of money sitting in cash. And when an interesting product is coming along, they're engaging. And when there is a firmer tone, whether it's from here or Europe or anywhere else internationally, we see an uptick in activity. So as Ruth said, it's remained enormously stable during a pretty depressed period. And in my view, it wouldn't take a whole lot for that revenue outlook to turn in a positive way.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, Ruth, you mentioned the hedge funds looked like they're taking a bit more leverage this quarter. Could you provide a little additional color as to if there are specific markets or products where they are willing to put on more leverage?","Ruth Porat","I think it's a pretty broad-based statement that we're saying. I can't pinpoint it to any particular market as broader.","Operator","The next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First, a quick one on CVA. Are we done there? Or is there more of that coming in subsequent quarters?","Ruth Porat","So you specifically asked about CVA, not DVA. Obviously, both are affected by movements in credit spreads, and so we don't forecast movements in credit spreads.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. But I think it was last quarter where you said that there was a big change because of the downgrade. And so I was more referring to the outsized move as it related to that with the increased collateral.","Ruth Porat","Okay. Sorry about that. So there weren't more collateral calls this quarter, so you're not -- there was -- we basically had the initial flurry of collateral calls post the ratings action in June. And it pretty much subsided even before we got to the second quarter earnings call. It was initial flurry and that was it. And so you do not see an impact from collateral calls this quarter.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Good deal. And then sticking with the capital markets, nice to see a pretty solid bounce-back there in FICC and great to hear about clients reengaging. Is that still -- is there still a tailwind coming there and still continuing to benefit you? Or do you feel as though everybody now is back and FICC is up to full speed? In other words, do we have more coming, more benefit?","Ruth Porat","Well, we always want to be doing more with our clients, so I wouldn't put an endpoint on it. I think that we were helped to have the ratings action behind us and clients reengage. And you can see that in the numbers. The move by the ECB in the summer, as I noted, I do think helped bring clients back into the market more broadly, that had been a big headwind as well. But in our view, we've got a very focused approach to the businesses and are looking to continue to build share.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. Sorry if I wasn't more specific. I just meant the reengagement post-Moody's, if you felt as though at this point folks are now fully back and reengaged.","Ruth Porat","It's hard to disaggregate what's going on in the macro from any particular, is there any particular lag. Our sense is that clients have reengaged and we're continuing to work to build market share with them. And it feels that it's pretty much been addressed, but I was actually very directly saying that we're continuing to drive share and looking at that. So it's hard to be more specific.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. No, that's fair. Aside from benefiting from the market conditions, more favorable market conditions as you highlighted, in the Commodities business, Goldman hit on weakness and specifically highlighted weakness there. Could you give some more color on how that business went this quarter for you guys?","Ruth Porat","Yes, it was -- commodities was up meaningfully versus last quarter. But as we noted, it was much lower last quarter. And that was due to a more favorable market environment. It is still down year-over-year. So I think some of the backdrop continued to be a bit challenging. And as we've discussed before, for us, the business is a mix of flow and structured solutions for clients, and it can be quite lumpy.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then last one for me. There was a good deal of noise made in the press on trends within FAs in Wealth Management. You never know how much of that's noise versus something real. So have you guys seen any uptick in defections post-integration? Have you seen any tangible evidence of dissatisfaction? I know the total FA headcount went up, but sometimes there's junior brokers that get at it and that can skew. So if you could give maybe some color on that, that'd be helpful.","Ruth Porat","Well, FA attrition continues to run at low levels. In fact, for the top 2 quintiles, which is what we typically call out, the attrition was lower in the third quarter than it has been for the last several quarters. And if you look at metrics like annual revenue per financial advisor or assets per financial advisor, all of the trends are going in the right direction. So there's always some movement in and out. Actually, this quarter, FAs are down a bit as it was between the first and second quarter. But attrition's lower than it has been. Or to put it differently, retention is running at higher levels.","Operator","The next question is from Richard Ramsden with Goldman Sachs.","Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I've got a question around Basel III again. Given the uncertainty around the outcome of the final NPRs as well as given some of the questions around the model approval process, is it possible to give a range of outcome for what your Basel III numbers ultimately could be?","Ruth Porat","Well, the way we approach the Basel III guidance is it's based on, as I said, our current interpretation of the rules. What it does not include is the benefit of model approval, which is obviously a key part of the transition. And we view model approvals as incremental upside. And so what we'll do is layer that in as we get model approvals. I mean, there are certain models that are kind of more foundational, like IMM. But if you look at CRM model approval, which I think a number of people -- a number are coming back to, we don't include the benefit of CRM model approval. So for example, in the second quarter, I mentioned that we estimated that our Tier 1 common ratio would be up about 40 basis points based on the book at that point in time. And the reason we don't bake that into our guidance, our spot guidance, is as you know, even when you receive CRM model approval, you have to wait a year to incorporate the benefit in the calculation so that by any -- under any set of facts would be an event at least a year out. And given that the book changes and we're actively reducing it, the benefit changes as well. So although we're working to get model approval, we thought it was most prudent not to include the benefit of things like that in the guidance we give you and as we put it kind of greater than 9%, and that gives us the room to take it up as we get model approval.","Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So to be clear, you haven't included CRM. How about things like stressed VAR and the incremental risk charge? Are those included in your number as well or not?","Ruth Porat","So CRM is not included, but things that -- I'll call them the kind of foundational models that move you from Basel I and II and through the various regimes, like IMM or IRB, are included. It's just the specific models that are available and that we're clearly working on to take risk-weighted assets down as with the CRM model.","Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what do you think is a reasonable time period in terms of getting full model approval from the Fed, i.e. is this something that's months out? Or do you think it could take longer than that?","Ruth Porat","Well, the reason we're not including it in our guidance is because we can't answer that question. So we're working on it, and I think it will take -- they seem to -- there's obviously a lot going on with the various moves from I to II to 2.5 and III. So I can't estimate the date, but we will provide updates as the models get approved.","Richard Ramsden - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the second question I wanted to ask. Can you confirm buying out the remainder of Smith Barney doesn't have a significant capital impact? I think you've said that on a couple of occasions. Given that, when we think about capital returns next year, should we think about buying out the remainder of Smith Barney versus buying back stock as an either\/or decision? Or do you think there's potentially room for you to do both?","Ruth Porat","Well, as I think James said, it's premature to judge the CCAR process. We haven't even seen the rules yet. But as you've seen from actions today and James' comments, the first priority is the Wealth Management joint venture, the additional 35%, given -- or portions that I've given, the strategic value of the business. So at this point, it's premature to judge CCAR.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
