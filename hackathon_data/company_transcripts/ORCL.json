Please go ahead, sir.","Ken Bond","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations Web site. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.","As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today.","As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. Good morning \u2013 good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1, I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q2, and turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments.","Clearly, we are pleased with our results, with the most obvious thing being that we overachieved again in the cloud especially in the United States. As you all know, we have pivoted the organization to go after the cloud and we are outperforming even our most aggressive expectations.","This has resulted in our growth rate continuing to accelerate as we scale in the cloud, something our competitors are not similarly experiencing. We continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls, so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters, as well as to reflect how we measure the business.","This quarter, the effects of currency movements were more than expected mostly because of the surprise Brexit vote happened after our earnings call, resulting in a 1% to 3% headwind in most revenue categories, including 1% to total revenue and EPS, which was a $0.01 lower as a result.","Cloud, SaaS, and PaaS revenues for the quarter was $816 million, up 82% from last year and above the 80% high-end of my guidance. While this excellent growth rate was helped a little by recent acquisitions, organic growth accelerated from both Q4 and Q1 of last year. Actually organic SaaS and PaaS growth rates has accelerated for seven straight quarters.","You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.5 billion, up 49% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 49% in U.S. dollars this quarter, up from 38% last quarter. We put the billings numbers up on our web site for you to see the detail.","Our SaaS and PaaS business has now grown to the point where the dollar growth in SaaS and PaaS revenue exceeded the dollar decline in new software license. Together, SaaS and PaaS subscriptions and new software license grew 16% in constant currency. As our Saas and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin also continues to expand.","The Q1 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 62%, up from 40% last Q1, and we expect to see further improvements in fiscal year 2017, and from there, we\u2019ll be targeting 80% over time. Combined with cloud infrastructure as a service revenue of $171 million, which was up 10%. Our total cloud revenue in the quarter was nearly $1 billion, up 63% in constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $5.8 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year.","Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels, as our growing installed base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were slightly over $1 billion, down 10%, reflecting the continued migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support was down 11%, with hardware systems product revenues of $462 million and hardware support revenues of $535 million.","Our engineered systems grew mid double-digit lead by Exadata that grew over 30% in the quarter. For the company, total revenues for the quarter was $8.6 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.4 billion and operating margin was 39%.","I need to remind you that the large debt offering we did last quarter cost about $0.005 in EPS in the quarter. The additional interest was not in my guidance as the debt offering took place after the guidance call. For Q2, I expect the added interest will lower EPS by more than $0.01 without the matching benefit of next week\u2019s contribution to earnings, which will be accretive until the deal closes.","G&A expenses were also higher than usual in Q1 because of some legal fees, which will be lower in the second quarter and largely gone by Q3 as a result of the settlement of one case and the end of two trials.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was higher than projected due to the geographic mix of earnings, which is driven by our overachievement in cloud revenues in the U.S., resulting in a tax rate of 25.5 and EPS being a $0.01 lower at $0.55 in U.S. dollars, but still up 5% in constant currency.","The GAAP tax rate was 22.8% and GAAP EPS was $0.43 in [USD] [ph], up 11% in constant currency. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.7 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter was $299 million. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.6 billion, up 5% from last year. We now have approximately $68 billion in cash and marketable securities, net of debt our cash position is approximately $14.3 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.5 billion, up 5% in constant currency.","As we said before, we\u2019re committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation that make both strategic and financial sense.","This quarter, we repurchased 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Okay, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. For those of you curious about NetSuite, I can report that we have now cleared antitrust reviews everywhere, except the United States, where our waiting period expires at the end of September.","Now, to the guidance. I\u2019m going to give you guidance for Q2 and then some updated comments for the fiscal year. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. And while we feel good about our own performance and transformation, I\u2019m always keeping an eye on the macro environment, [especially abroad] [ph].","If current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, we expect to see SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow again, 78% to 82%, a little bit more than I guided last time. Software and cloud revenue, including SaaS\/PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support is expected to grow 3% to 5%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to 3%. EPS is expected to be between $0.59 and $0.62 in constant currency, were it not for the higher tax rate and interest expense, we would expect EPS to grow approximately 4%, or be $0.06 higher.","Over the full-year of fiscal year 2017, I\u2019m raising the outlook for fiscal year 2017 SaaS and PaaS revenue growth from 65% to 67%. I continue to expect the SaaS and PaaS gross margins will exit Q4 higher than the 62% reported today, as our cloud business continues to grow dramatically.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark for his comments.","Mark Hurd","Thanks, Safra. First, we just had a great quarter. And I want to thank everybody at Oracle for their hard work, all of our employees. I\u2019m going to give you a lot of numbers. Let me start with booking and revenue growth rates. I\u2019m going to give them to you year-on-year in CD, unless I state otherwise.","Cloud bookings ARR was $271 million in USD, a 42% growth. As a reminder, ARR growth last year was 166%. SaaS bookings were $165 million USD and PaaS\/IaaS bookings were $106 million USD. As Safra said, Saas\/PaaS revenue was up 82%, I just want to repeat the seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth acceleration.","Our ERP EPM revenue grew 70% quarter-on-quarter. The seventh consecutive quarter with sequential growth that was greater than 50%. In Fusion HCM, we grew 131%, nearly 4 times the growth rate of Workday. In CX separately, up double digits in sales, marketing, and service. Data as a service was up 75%. Platform as a service up 22% quarter-on-quarter. Overall, we grew 82%, the highest global growth rate at any scale cloud company.","SaaS\/PaaS billings grew 49% in the quarter, up from 38% last quarter. Deferred SaaS\/PaaS revenue was up 49%. SaaS customer metrics. We closed 776 new SaaS customers in the quarter. We have 677 expansions. 125 customers, who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. 346 new CX customers, 488 expansions. A 173 new HCM customers drove that great result, inclusive of 69 expansions. 344 ERP EPM customers and 135 expansions.","Our active base is now 2,800 customers with a 1,000 live 10x Workday. Over 50% of our ERP EPM customers were net new to Oracle, that never purchased an Oracle app before. Two-thirds of our new customer wins were Fusion. 334 go lives in Fusion, our best quarter ever. 2,032 PaaS customers that were new in the quarter.","Our installed base is now 11,000 PaaS customers. 1,671 new infrastructure as a service customers that are supplemental to our PaaS customers. Together our installed base of PaaS and infrastructure is now at 18,892 customers. As a point of clarification, PaaS and infrastructure customers accounted for each service that they use.","In closing, this was just a very solid quarter for us, not only in revenue, but bookings and billings. Look forward to few predictions. Q1 bookings were solid at 42%. I believe, Q2 will be better, could even be much better. Q1 revenue was fantastic at 82%. It\u2019s one of the reasons, as Safra described, we\u2019re raising our guidance from 65% to 67%. And I just want to close by saying, we are the fastest growing scale cloud company in the world.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry.","Larry Ellison","Thanks, Mark. We\u2019re very excited about the rollout of our generation 2 infrastructure as a service data centers. These new data centers give us the significant cost and performance advantage over Amazon Web Services. Plus, our new bare metal offering makes it possible for our customers to lift and shift their entire existing corporate infrastructure, data and applications without any changes whatsoever and move it to the Oracle Public Cloud. You just can\u2019t do that with Amazon Web Services.","Lift and shift the entire network, DM, database, data, applications, move all of that across to our data centers without changing anything. So real advantage. So for the first time, we have this big technology advantage in the infrastructure as a service. We expect this will enable Oracle to accelerate our infrastructure as a service business to the same high growth rates that we\u2019re currently experiencing in both SaaS and PaaS.","With that, we\u2019re ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Now, we\u2019ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Question for Mark. Mark, the bookings number looked impressive and you hinted at the better numbers in Q2. And \u2013 but you also in press release talked about the $2 billion that you want to achieve for this year, which actually needs a slightly better than 42% growth for the year. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers that drive that strong number and the [indiscernible] acceleration here? Thank you.","Mark Hurd","Sure. Yes, I mean, obviously, to your point, we grew 42% in the quarter. I actually, as good as that was, we could have done better, that\u2019s how strong our pipeline is right now. And as I told most of you that as we\u2019ve gone through this cloud transition, we\u2019ve got a pipeline, and we understand now with as more data has come clear to us, how that translates to performance, and our performance continues to get better. And I think it\u2019s all of the things we\u2019ve talked about, not only have we got more salespeople than we had before, they\u2019re better trained.","Our customers are more aware. We have more references. We have more go lives and all of that feeds together. In addition, we not only have more products, we\u2019re going to release more products, yet, even this week at \u2013 or next week at OpenWorld. But more of our existing products are available in more geographies. So as for example, as we released ERP, ERP actually has not been available in every geographic market in the world as it now is. So you\u2019ve got a culmination of all of these factors that lead into it, but we are going to have a very strong bookings year, as I described.","Raimo Lenschow","Thank you.","Ken Bond","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","This is Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley and thanks for taking the question. From our perspective, it looks like over the past two years, we\u2019ve seen Oracle make a large push away from perpetual licenses towards attrition-based SaaS offerings on the application side of the business. And now, it appears that that push is shifting more on the database tech side of the business, steering more business towards platform as a service. So one, is that a correct assumption that focuses more on database tech going towards platform as a service?","And two, how should investors think about the impacts of that shift in FY 2017, in particular?","Larry Ellison","Okay. This is Larry. The \u2013 we started our Fusion applications efforts a little over 10 years ago. So we started rewriting all of our applications for the cloud about a decade ago. And when those applications were ready, we moved aggressively to sell those applications. We believe that\u2019s what customers wanted. They wanted cloud-based applications, not on-premise-based application. We have made a huge investment in rewriting all of our applications. And those were ready before \u2013 and we were ready to move into SaaS application.","Before we were ready to move into infrastructure as a service or PaaS, we were just ready sooner. So we pushed back. The interest, again, the interesting thing here is, we are just beginning to move our database customers from on-premise into the cloud. Microsoft has already done a very good job of moving their office customers from on-prem into the cloud, and that\u2019s the basis of the overwhelming basis of their cloud growth.","The overwhelming basis of our cloud growth are new customers for applications. So we haven\u2019t started shifting our base yet, which I think is very interesting. We got these applications ready. We\u2019re gaining share right and left, let\u2019s say. We mentioned Workday a lot, because there are primary competitor for HCM and ERP in the cloud. And as Mark pointed out, we have 10 times more customers than Workday has in ERP and we sold more, but those are - half of those are net new customers, okay? So that\u2019s us gaining share in that business.","We\u2019re now beginning to move our installed base into the cloud. And this is a lot of expansion. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to stop running in premise. We believe this is sort of the next decade. This is a coexistent story. They are going to continue running some of their stuff on-premise and they\u2019re going to move some of their stuff into the cloud and those two things have to coexist.","And our unique offerings to our customers and database is the fact that we support the identical software on-premise and in the cloud. And you can move data and workload back and forth very, very gracefully, that\u2019s our PaaS offering. And by the way, if you are a SaaS customer, your application is built on top of our database and our middleware. So you buy SaaS with PaaS. You often buy together, as Mark pointed out.","Finally, so PaaS was ready second, we were ready, we were moving aggressively in the PaaS. Now what we\u2019re looking for is the third leg of the stool, which is to push into infrastructure as a service, where we have an all new and very [indiscernible] competitor Amazon.com, but we think now with our new generation 2 data centers we have a big competitive advantage over Amazon.com. And people will be buying our PaaS and our infrastructure as a service together.","So we sell PaaS twice. Sometimes we package PaaS with our application SaaS together. And this new business is selling PaaS with infrastructure as a service, where they\u2019re building a lot of custom applications or moving existing applications into the cloud. What I think about it is, our SaaS business has got a new business or lot of new customers. We\u2019re just beginning to shift our installed base from the on-premise into the cloud, which is enormous potential for us.","And we think we make a lot more money by moving customers off-premise into the cloud, because we do a lot more things for the customer. We help the customers save money, but we also provide with our database storage and networking and compute and all of the associated support service. So we think, again, this is beginning of still more rapid growth for Oracle.","Mark Hurd","One thing, I would not want you to walk away with, as you said, shifting from SaaS to PaaS. We\u2019re not shifting. We\u2019re supplementing, I mean, this is in SaaS, we have more energy and more momentum than we\u2019ve ever had. We\u2019re are now taking our foot off of that accelerator. We are supplement \u2013 by the way, let me just be clear to Larry\u2019s point, if we could push a button and move all of our on-prem Oracle database customers to PaaS, we would do it. It is economically beneficial to us.","Secondly, we think it\u2019s the way customers also want to buy now. But there is this transition that Larry talked about that we are going through. So but I don\u2019t want to do think SaaS and PaaS have some inner relationships to the energy [indiscernible]. We have separate actually sales organizations to do both. Our energy is on both, we think both are tremendous opportunities about to be supplemented by our infrastructure offerings that Larry referenced.","Keith Weiss","Thank you, guys.","Ken Bond","Next question please.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie.","Sarah Hindlian","Hi, great, thank you. It\u2019s Hindlian. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the momentum in the cloud, Larry, Safra, and Mark. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what is driving some of the success you\u2019re seeing there? I know you mentioned conversions on the pipeline are strong and reference customers are now live, but are you seeing any success around the streamlining of cloud purchases through the new accelerated buying experience, or is this more sales compensation changes, and of course, product functionality improvements that\u2019s driving the success in the cloud? Some more comments and color would be very greatly appreciated?","Safra Catz","Well, for sure, I think it really is very much all of the above. So let me just address the accelerated buying experience, because the most important part of it is that, we end up being able to service our customers much more quickly, much more efficiently. Our salespeople become so much more productive, they can spend more of their time, really the bulk of their time with the customers outwardly facing, making them successful instead of inwardly facing, dealing with our own back office.","So this has really unleashed a massive amount of productivity. Obviously, having many references is critical for the success of software service, because customers all talk to each other and the happier customers lead to more happy customers, which is by the way one of the reasons we love Oracle OpenWorld, because tens of thousands of our customers come and they share their positive experiences and that just gets more and more customers excited and participating.","And then, of course, the sales force has an enormous amount of success, which ends up leading to just more success, more productivity. The entire thing, this is very, very virtuous cycle, all of which starts with having the best product. That\u2019s really the bottom line, ultimately.","As Larry mentioned, we spent a decade, frankly, it\u2019s a little over a decade in building these products. We had leading products to begin with, but we started and rewrote them all, focused exclusively \u2013 really focused on the cloud and that\u2019s what ultimately shows through.","Sarah Hindlian","Thank you, Safra.","Safra Catz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies.","John DiFucci","Thank you. I\u2019m going to ask another question about the cloud. I mean, when we look at your traction here, and it\u2019s been much better than we would have thought, especially in this quarter, which usually is seasonally slow quarter. I mean, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a company of scale move to cloud with the kind of gusts that we\u2019ve seen here. As Larry mentioned, the cloud move here was mostly new \u2013 I think you said customers, but I think you meant new workloads. I mean, when should we expect to see more customers actually transition current workloads from on-premise to the cloud? And how is this going to affect the aggregate bottom line in the near-term?","Larry Ellison","By the way, we met new customers, not the new Workload. [Multiple Speakers]","Mark Hurd","He did a mistake. He met new customers. And then we did say and I\u2019ll give you a flavor in the quarters and I didn\u2019t do this for the interest of time. But just give an idea of new customers in the quarter and just SaaS ERP, I mean, we closed Adventist Health, [indiscernible] Rico, Sachs, Tesco, Texas Instruments, UCLA Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center\u2026","John DiFucci","So were these customers never customers of Oracle before?","Mark Hurd","They are current app. I mean, [Multiple Speakers] application out there.","John DiFucci","Okay.","Mark Hurd","We just make a distinction between moving an existing application customer from, let\u2019s say, an Oracle e-business big customers Oracle Fusion ERP and the cloud.","John DiFucci","Got it.","Mark Hurd","We\u2019re just taking an SAP customer and moving them from SAP to Oracle Fusion application. And I think coming back to the point Larry was making earlier. Most of what you see in our cloud revenue number is customers that more than 50% were customers, who were not an Oracle application customer, before they became an Oracle SaaS customer.","So these are really new customers. And then to your point, that are bringing new workloads that we had not before. The exciting part, which again, I\u2019ll go back to what Larry said was, the core of our on-prem user base, particularly in the database arena has not moved. And that is a huge opportunity for us, that\u2019s only people that can move them to the cloud efficiently and effectively or us.","John DiFucci","Right.","Mark Hurd","So that\u2019s why this is such an excess. We get \u2013 maybe we don\u2019t to as good job as when we did as we feel it here, because what we\u2019ve seen so far is what you would think of, John, is normally the hardest stuff going out and finding net new customers.","Larry Ellison","So, John, I\u2019ll just distinguish again what I said before. Microsoft is holding on to their office customers by moving up them on-prem into the cloud. We are not holding on, just holding on to our on-prem customers, moving our application customers to the cloud. We are doing that too. We are holding on to our apps customers by moving them to the cloud. But more than that, we\u2019re gaining more than half of them are net new customers.","So that\u2019s very different than what you see is going on in the Microsoft. And our big installed base, which is the database, we\u2019re preeminent. We really haven\u2019t begun \u2013 we\u2019re just beginning in the early stages of holding on to them and moving them to the cloud. So it\u2019s a bit of a different story between us and Microsoft. That exciting prospect of moving all those database customers to cloud, that\u2019s in front of us. And that\u2019s what makes and I, congratulate Microsoft on doing what they\u2019ve done. It\u2019s the right strategy for them.","Ours has been, what we\u2019ve said, we want to do that, but we want to do more. And we think we have the opportunity. Safra mentioned another very important metric, our renewal rates are where they\u2019ve always been, which tells you the bulk of our base that\u2019s on prem is still yet to move. And it tells you and support the story about how much from us is just plain net new opportunities, John, for us.","John DiFucci","Great, that\u2019s very clear. I did ask the question on the effect of the bottom line too here, at least, in the near-term, because I \u2013 Safra was clear with the impact to some of those extra items to the guidance for EPS relative to what expectations were anyway. But is there going to -- I mean should \u2013 is this going to \u2013 we know it can be suppressive to margins, at least, initially, and we have seen that, but at the same time, it looks like, and this is first time.","Larry Ellison","I\u2019m going to let \u2013 I\u2019ll let Safra comment again, but I want to make sure it\u2019s clear what we were saying. This is actually the fact that we\u2019ve done a very good job in the U.S. growing our cloud business, that\u2019s eventually had the strange effect of raising our tax rate, right?","John DiFucci","Got it.","Larry Ellison","This is the bad news you could get. So we\u2019re in a situation, where I hate to say, we over executed, but that\u2019s sort of how you feel, and yet to be clear, John, our bookings in Europe are very strong. And so this is going to normalize. This is just a point of us putting or moving those bookings into revenue.","Mark Hurd","So, as we have more balance between our international cloud sales and our U.S. cloud sales, the tax rate should drift back to where it normally is, when we have the same mix. It\u2019s just now, we have a disproportionate amount of our cloud revenue in the United States. That\u2019s the balance and expect the tax rate to go back.","While the bookings balance, it\u2019s just the current period revenue that we\u2019ve got today. But this is overall a \u2013 might be a very good story. And let\u2019s not lose the fact of the other numbers that Safra described very early. Our margins are now at 62% in our SaaS\/PaaS margins, which we talked about way back when they were at 39%, as we were investing infrastructure to prepare for what we have now.","And so, I think, the margin story, John, is also beginning to solidify, as we continue to grow and put revenue on top of the base.","John DiFucci","Great, that\u2019s all. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you so much. This is a question for Safra. Safra, support grew \u2013 software support grew 3% year-over-year, but was flat sequentially. I\u2019m wondering, if there\u2019s any color you could provide here on the trends in that business? And also, if you can share with us how you think about the trade-off between support and cloud revenue, and how you think about the sustainability of that software support stream? Thank you.","Safra Catz","Sure. So, of course, you have to remember, we\u2019re going from Q4 to Q1. So our Q1 new licenses are seasonally lowest one anyway, okay? Now, as you know, our focus is now on cloud. And so as new license becomes a smaller number, especially in Q1, it means that it does not \u2013 that the support base does not grow as much. There\u2019s also little bit of currency, but you should ignore that. So that\u2019s the first thing.","Now, I know you\u2019re probably worried that all of a sudden support is going to go negative, the base is going to go negative. We don\u2019t foresee that happening, okay, because the base is continuing to grow, even though new license amount is not growing year-over-year as much or is actually shrinking as more of our customers pivot to the cloud. We still sell new licenses, which means the base does continue to grow, and it grew 3% year-over-year.","So that\u2019s, I think, I don\u2019t know, you had a few parts to your question, but that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on here. We don\u2019t \u2013 yes, that\u2019s it.","Heather Bellini","Great. And if I could just on that point just with the support trends that you are seeing, is this still a year, where you\u2019ve forecasted bottom and operating income? I\u2019m sorry, fiscal 2016 being the bottom, my apologies.","Safra Catz","Yes. Yes, it is. Absolutely, absolutely. And I do want to say one more time, again, and also Mark mentioned it, our retention rates, our renewal rates in our support business remain very, very high. So, in fact, they\u2019re a little bit higher this quarter than another quarter. It\u2019s all within a band of very high, they remain that way.","Mark Hurd","And so they are high, Heather. But again, I want to reiterate as I said before now in this call. If a customer does move to the cloud, we actually get more money. So we actually do more things for the customer. We now do their hard work. We get all the database. We get all the middleware. We get a multiple on the support dollar. And as our \u2013 so our support dollar goes up, when it converts into a cloud revenue dollar. Back to the margin story we talked about five minutes ago, those margins in the cloud, as we see them approaching the levels that Safra described earlier, this is good news for us.","So, yes, the renewal rates are what they are, we predict support to be the way they described. But this is not bad news, as we begin to move our base to the cloud. This is actually good news.","Heather Bellini","Thank you.","Ken Bond","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So Safra, just wanted your comment on gross profits. One of the things we look for in cloud transition stories is, when do gross profit start to grow? And clearly after a two-year slump, your investment is starting to pay off, the gross profits were up for the first time in two years, I believe. Can you talk about the disparity between gross profit growth, which obviously quite important and the operating income growth there? Is that bit of a lag effect here?","And also if I could ask you, Mark or Larry, on the PaaS side, can you just give us a little bit more color, what kind of projects our customer picking Oracle for when they sign a PaaS deal, particularly, given that you\u2019ve surprised us with the announcement of a number of new customers for the PaaS, that I would have thought that would be just typical Oracle database customers, but looks like something new could be happening, if you could shed some light, that\u2019d be great. Thank you.","Safra Catz","Sure. So first, I mean, you really should take directions from what\u2019s going on in our gross profit lines for the most strategic part of our business, which is moving to the cloud and software and software as a service. And that is going to be very much followed up. One of the things we do have that is costing us is that, our hardware business outside of our engineered system is getting smaller. And the expense line has not adjusted equally.","As you can imagine us pretty well that\u2019s something that\u2019s very straightforward for us to finish out during the year. And that is our expectation. In addition, you also talked \u2013 or you may have mentioned currency and tax and things like that. So obviously, currency is something I can\u2019t project. And I think after the Brexit vote, I\u2019m pretty sure nobody else has projected it correctly either. So but the way it affect us, just so that you know is that the U.S. and Oracle is ahead of Europe in a move to the cloud and in and outside of the United States.","However, as Mark mentioned, the bookings are very, very high. So bookings that were booked in the United States over the past year are turning into revenue already in the United States. Since the number is smaller in Europe, the bookings, the revenue numbers are smaller, the bookings are approaching those of the United States. And those are going to start flowing through revenues. That will, in fact, impact our tax rate and readjust it back to the lower rates that you maybe used to.","So that\u2019s going to take a little while and that should go through. In addition, as you know, we do have some significant borrowings, and as a result, we have a very large amount of cash on our balance sheet right now, which is not earning very high result. We are looking forward to closing the next week deal, which we believe to be accretive. And that will also be helpful.","Larry Ellison","The other part of your question \u2013 this is Larry is we sell PaaS too it. PaaS is sometimes attached to SaaS. Think of it like Salesforce.com. They have their Force.com platform, where it\u2019s used to extend the Salesforce application. We have our platform that people use to extend our SaaS application. So SaaS, you buy a number of SaaS application or suite of SaaS applications and you buy certain amount of PaaS to extend and build data marks, data warehouses, other things add features and functions use PaaS for that.","Also the bigger opportunity is when you buy PaaS and infrastructure as a service together, where you\u2019re either writing brand-new, net new custom applications, or you\u2019re lifting and shifting an existing custom application to our infrastructure as a service and then moving the database associated with that application to our PaaS. That\u2019s actually the bigger opportunity. And you\u2019re beginning to see that start to drive our PaaS business higher, and of course, it will accelerate the growth rate of our infrastructure as a service business as well.","Mark Hurd","I\u2019d add just one last thing. Exadata as a Service has been a very strong PaaS offering. So we count Exadata as a service, meaning, you can now get Exadata in the cloud, as you can get it on on-premise. And our Exadata service \u2013 Exadata as a service offering has been a strong PaaS offering. So we actually don\u2019t even add that into the engineered systems numbers that Safra described earlier, and that\u2019s really the strength and popularity of Exadata. We also have pretty good size business now built in PaaS, which is a cloud integration services business inside our platform, as well.","So everything Larry said, all the debt has stuff supplementing of our SaaS offerings, Exadata and the data integration services are at the core of our most popular PaaS offerings.","Ken Bond","Okay. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much. Mark, given that you guys have a view into both the on-premise and the cloud world. I was wondering, if you could give us some sense on where you think larger, say Fortune 1000 types are in terms of moving their ERP systems to the cloud as well, CRM and HM seem to be past the tipping point. There is some debate as to how fast some of the bigger companies are going to move ERP. And I was just kind of curious what you\u2019re seeing in your pipeline, and is that necessary, does that have to happen for you guys to sort of hit your AR forecast for this year? Just trying to get a sense on where we are in that front?","Mark Hurd","The answer to your last question in no. And the answer to your first question is faster than I would have thought two or three years ago. And so some of the names I wrote \u2013 I read earlier are scale companies. When you see somebody like Tesco moving, when you seeing an HSBC moving.","When you see some of these brands, and we have all types of brands in our list of ERP companies ranging from GE and others, as I described to sort of newer companies like Left and others that are sort of newer hot mid-market companies they might not even had a set of financials before. And it\u2019s really all of the above. And I think the thing that we get excited about is the reason we talked about Workday, probably, as much as we do is, we see them, at least, for the SaaS offering, our core on-prem competitors historically hasn\u2019t done anything.","So when you tried and when you look at their base, their base begins to look for some of the benefits that our base now has the opportunity to take advantage of. We think there\u2019s a possibility for a relatively sizeable market share shift over the years, as we move forward. So I \u2013 Kirk, I do think, you\u2019re going to see how you\u2019re kicking and you see it now of many scaled companies that are of the biggest companies in the world, and you see it a few of them showing up on our list of recorded wins.","Kirk Materne","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","And our last question for the day will come from the line of Joel Fishbein with BTIG.","Joel Fishbein","Good afternoon. I just have a quick follow-up on a database. Clearly, had a \u2013 have very strong momentum in the cloud application business. Can you give us a little more color on where the database cycle will show up, and what\u2019s the best way for us to measure it. That will be helpful? Thanks.","Mark Hurd","Again, next week at Oracle Open World, this Sunday, we are announcing the latest version of our database, and it\u2019s going to be available in the cloud, on Exadata. We think \u2013 I think you\u2019re going to see a very rapid update of the new version. And we expect those customers to consume some of it on-prem, but also a significant amount of thier new database consumption is going to be in the cloud.","So I think 12 \u2013 Release 2 is going to move customers to the cloud more quickly than they otherwise might be.","Joel Fishbein","Great. Thank you.","Safra Catz","Okay.","Ken Bond","With that move to close the call please. But before we do that so, let me just finish up with the last couple of comments. Thank you for joining us today. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. The dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the investor relations department for any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thank you very much for joining us.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for closing.","Operator","Once again, we\u2019d like to thank you for dialing in for today\u2019s Oracle conference call. We appreciate your participation, and we ask that you please disconnect."],"16162":["Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) F3Q13 Results Earnings Call March 20, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Ken Bond - VP, IR","Safra Catz - President and CFO","Mark Hurd - President","Lawrence Ellison - CEO","Analysts","John DiFucci - JP Morgan","Brent Thill - UBS","Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Oracle Corporation quarterly conference call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to introduce Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations, Oracle. Please go ahead.","Ken Bond","Thank you, operator.  Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2013 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which include a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison, President and CFO Safra Catz, President Mark Hurd.","As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements.","These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.","And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before turning to questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I\u2019ll then review the guidance for Q4 and turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments. While our overall business remains very healthy, and we saw excellent pipeline growth, we\u2019re not at all pleased with our revenue growth this quarter. So it didn\u2019t help that our quarter ended on the same day as the sequester deadline. What we really saw is the lack of urgency we sometimes see in the sales force as Q3 deals fall into Q4.","Since we\u2019ve been adding literally thousands of new sales reps around the world, the problem was largely sales execution, especially with the new reps, as they ran out of runway in Q3. As expected, many of the pushed out deals have already closed. Our product portfolio is as strong as it has ever been, and we won more than our fair share of deals. Our discussions with customers continue to be elevated to the most strategic level. There is a lot of enthusiasm around our leadership in software, engineered systems, and our real-world approach to mixed public-private cloud deployment.","Looking forward, we\u2019re encouraged by the tremendous pipeline growth, but clearly we have work to do in training new reps on managing the sales process and the importance of establishing a quarter rhythm with their deals. As such, I\u2019ll be conservative in my Q4 guidance, even though Q4 is the quarter the sales force is in fact geared to.","Now to the numbers in Q3. Currency movements reduced new license revenue growth by 2%, and total revenues by 1%, and net income by 2% and earnings per share by approximately $0.01. I will focus on constant currency growth rates, unless I say otherwise.","This quarter, new software license revenue was $2.3 billion, flat in constant currency, down 2% in U.S. dollars. Cloud revenue was $238 million, or down 1%. APAC was up 1%, and EMEA was up 1%. Software license update and product support revenues were $4.3 billion, up 8% from last year, and were nearly half of total revenue. Support attach and renewal rates continue at their usual high level, actually at the highest levels for a Q3 in the last five years.","Hardware system products revenue was $671 million, and while engineered systems again showed excellent growth, we continue to work through our product transition with the high-end SPARC server line. Clearly, our customers know the new products are coming out next week, and have held off buying the older Ms. We expect that the launch next week of the new M line will help that.","Total revenue for the quarter was $9 billion, flat in constant currency and down 1% in U.S. dollars. Operating expenses were flat in constant currency, and our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to a Q3 record of 47%, up from 46% last year, even though we substantially increased headcount.","As revenues grow, and we continue to manage our business with discipline, we still believe that there remains a lot of leverage in our business model. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21%, and the GAAP tax rate was 19%. Both were favorably affected in the quarter by the retroactive extension of the R&D Tax Credit, though we did take a $65 million writedown of our Venezuela cash balance as the bolivar\u2019s official rate changed.","EPS for the quarter grew 5% in U.S. dollars to $0.65 on a non-GAAP basis, and would have been approximately $0.01 higher but for the negative impact of currency on revenues. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.52, up 6% in U.S. dollars. It would have been $0.53, up 8%, but for the impact of currency.","Operating cash flow increased to $13.7 billion over the last four quarters, up from $13.5 billion last year, and free cash flow grew to $13 billion over the last four quarters. Both are record results for Q3. We now have nearly $33.4 billion in cash and marketable securities, and as we\u2019ve said before, we remain committed to returning that value to our shareholders through technical innovation, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, and the prudent use of debt.","In this quarter, we repurchased 61.5 million shares for a total of $2.1 billion in the quarter. So over the last 12 months, we have repurchased nearly 350 million shares for a total value of $10.6 billion.","Now to the guidance. So for Q4, new software license and cloud subscription revenue growth is expected to range from 1% to 11% in constant currency and in reported dollars. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from a negative 22% to a negative 12% in constant dollars, negative 23% to negative 13% in reported dollars.","As a result, total revenue growth on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from negative 1% to positive 4% in constant dollars and U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.85 and $0.91, both U.S. dollars and in constant dollars, up from $0.82 last year, and GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.72 to $0.78 in both U.S. and constant dollars.","I\u2019ve gone ahead and assumed a GAAP tax rate of 23% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. Of course, it may end up being different.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark for his comments.","Mark Hurd ","Thanks, Safra. I\u2019ll just make a couple of quick comments and turn it over to Larry. We\u2019ve added over 4,000 people to the Oracle sales force in the last 18 months. We\u2019ve significantly expanded our customer coverage. We\u2019ve seen material growth in our pipeline. But Q3 [conversion rates] were below what we expected, while our actual win rate went up.","Moving to engineered systems, a record quarter for us, with more than 800 units sold in Q3. That\u2019s the best unit quarter ever. We\u2019ve now sold more than 5,000 engineered systems to date. In the first full quarter for Exadata X3, we sold over 400 systems. The pipe is up materially, and conversion rates are up.","The one-eighth rack systems in particular sold extremely well, causing ASPs to be down slightly, but these entry-level systems are just the beginning, as we expect to grow our business with these customers over the long term.","Better news, our Exadata has carried over to the other engineered system, which were more than 800 engineered systems sold this quarter. Exalogic, Big Data Appliance, Oracle Database Appliance, all three saw 30% sequential unit growth.","We had another solid quarter of verticals, which have grown faster than software license in all of the last four quarters. We had great growth in Cloud, CRM, and ACM. Wins at Travelocity, Walt Disney World, Kaiser Foundation, Office Depot, Match.com, [Deutsche Bahn], CGI Group, Southwest Airlines, Dow Chemical, Union Bank, Renault, National Instruments, and Lender Processing Services. That\u2019s a lot of names, took me a long time to read it, but I wanted to give you a flavor for the quality of names and the quantity of wins we had in the quarter that\u2019s driving our annual recruiting revenue up nicely.","In other hardware, as Safra mentioned, the T-Series continued to be our best-performing server product, but the M-Series lagged. ZFS Storage saw double digit growth for the quarter, which is the seventh straight quarter.","We\u2019ve been able to materially grow our sales force and our R&D while overall operating expenses were essentially flat from last year, and I think that\u2019s a testimony to our expense management and discipline.","Safra mentioned software support, which grew 8% [in CD] renewal rates, as she mentioned, at a five-year high for Q3, and by the way, with virtually no expense growth in our software support business as we recorded those results.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry.","Larry Ellison ","Thank you, Mark. Next week, we\u2019ll start deliveries of our next generation of servers, built using our new SPARC T5 microprocessor, the world\u2019s fastest microprocessor. Next week, we\u2019ll publish 17 world record benchmarks, including a TPC benchmark showing that the SPARC T5 is the fastest processor in the world for database. And the SPECjEnterprise benchmark, showing the SPARC T5, is the fastest processor in the world for Java middleware.","Our new T5 servers have up to eight processors, and are more than twice as fast as the T4 systems that they replace. Even more important is our new M5 server, which has up to 32 processors and runs its Oracle Database over 10 times faster than the similarly priced old M9000 server it replaces.  With the delivery of the M5 server next week, Oracle will finish upgrading every server in the SPARC product line dating from the time we acquired Sun.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Larry. Operator, we\u2019re now ready for the questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  We\u2019ll take our first question from John DiFucci with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","John DiFucci - JP Morgan","Mark and Safra, I\u2019d like you to address sort of a high-level question, because I know I\u2019m going to be asked this a lot tomorrow. The softness this quarter was surprisingly broad-based across both software and hardware, and it looks like across all regions. We appreciate your willingness to kind of look internally for the causes and answers here, but given the breadth of the relative weakness, it really begs the question whether something bigger is at work here. How much might macro forces have come into play here? Or even, perhaps, the sales approach or strategy versus the execution of that strategy. In fairness, you\u2019re still relatively early in the sales count expansion, but at this point, are there any thoughts of perhaps looking at things a little differently?","Mark Hurd ","I\u2019ll take it. Let me just go through what I think Safra said, and I\u2019ll sort of elaborate a bit on that. We feel great about both our strategy and our product line. So point one and two, we have no doubt, no question about that whatsoever.","Second, to your point, we have increased the sales force dramatically, and we feel great about our coverage. And that really shows up first in the pipeline performance that we\u2019ve got. Our pipeline is up significantly. We don\u2019t give you a number, because frankly I don\u2019t want you to give me a comparison every quarter with the pipe. But it is up materially.","The issue for us is simply conversion. Well, listen, anybody can come up with all kinds of factors. There\u2019s always something going on around the world at any given time, and for us we feel good about our ability to execute through it. And in this case, as I said, it really was just the conversion rate against the context of a materially higher pipeline.","Safra Catz ","Covering sort of one through three of the issues, we don\u2019t think at all it\u2019s the products, because the pipeline\u2019s fantastic, and our win rates are excellent, and so we feel very, very good about that worldwide.","As far as being the economy, there\u2019s no really new news on the economy. As I mentioned, it doesn\u2019t help that the sequester deadline is on the last day of our quarter, and so that has a little bit of an impact here in North America, but not necessarily anywhere else. The economy has been as it is in Europe for a while. So there\u2019s no real new news.","And then finally, on sales execution, why we think that\u2019s it, is frankly because it\u2019s playing out exactly that way as deals kind of flop over right into Q4. And so especially with the newest folks, they\u2019re really geared to their annual target and there\u2019s a little less urgency about q3. For you, who have covered Oracle for so, so long, and for some of us who have been here a long time, it was very Q3, and now it\u2019s extremely Q4 around here.","And that is something we\u2019re kind of used to, except when there are acquisitions, sometimes you don\u2019t see it as much, because of the new companies and what they bring, and they change the seasonality a bit. But ultimately, Q3 is very similar to Q2, and then Q4 is the big quarter. Everybody\u2019s aimed at Q4, and it really feels like that around here right now.","Operator","We\u2019ll take the next question from Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS","Question for Larry on the hardware business. Q4 was set to be an inflection point, and it appears that has been pushed out. What\u2019s your sense on the turnaround? And if you could just contrast on the Exa side versus the other side of the hardware business? Maybe some more metrics as to what you\u2019re seeing?","Larry Ellison  ","Well, the oldest product in our product line was the M9000, the large CLM systems, which we hadn\u2019t refreshed for several years. And we saw very, very substantial and continuous decline in that business. It wasn\u2019t helped by people who were aware that we were going to go through a product transition in Q4.","So that didn\u2019t help us in Q3, and now we\u2019ve got to go through this product transition in Q4. We\u2019re announcing the new M5, the new T5, and we think people might take a couple of months to evaluate these systems before they verify that our claims are correct. The T5 is more than twice as fast as the T4 it replaces, much better price performance. And amazingly, the M5 is more than 10 times faster than the M9000 it replaces.","So we think Q4 will be better than Q3, as far as the hardware is concerned, but I think we expect the turnaround really to begin in Q1, not in Q4, because we have this large introduction of new systems.","I think the other thing that Mark alluded to was that we announced some lower-end Exadata systems, in our engineered space, and new customers have been beginning with the smaller systems, now that they\u2019re available, eighth rack rather than quarter racks. And that\u2019s somewhat lowered our ASP this past [unintelligible].","I think we work our way through that over the next two quarters. Again, I think Q1 you\u2019re going to see a big turnaround, and next year will be a big growth year for our entire hardware business. The front line and all of the engineered systems.","Mark Hurd  ","I\u2019d just add a couple of comments on the engineered systems line, so you have more clarity. On the eighth rack, this is actually good news, even though it lowers ASP, because we deliver a lot more technology and a lot more performance. And as I mentioned, our unit counts were at a record level in Q3. And we have the opportunity to upgrade those machines over the long run. So the fact that we\u2019ve seen our pipeline is up, our unit levels are up, and so I think to Larry\u2019s point, this puts us in a really strong position as we get into Q1 of next year on the engineered systems side as well.","Operator","We\u2019ll take the next question from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse ","Just had a question on the software business. I know you guys don\u2019t break out database and middleware, and you have tech versus applications anymore, but I was wondering if you could just give a sense of what you saw this quarter in terms of the performance between those two old segments, and then just what you\u2019re seeing in the pipeline. And then also, just one follow up for Larry, specifically to Oracle Fusion applications. There\u2019s been some debate out there about what your win rates are with Oracle Fusion now it\u2019s versus some competitors. Oracle Fusion applications, are they more modern, less modern, that competitors? Just provide us an update of where we stand there.","Safra Catz ","Basically, database and apps move together in the quarter. So there\u2019s no special news there one way or the other. And the second question was for you.","Larry Ellison ","I think one of the things we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve become very, very focused on not just Fusion applications, but all of our cloud applications. So a lot of the new headcount, a lot of the changes in the organization in the field have been based on focusing on the cloud, increasing our win rate in the cloud, having specialization around HCM, having specialization around service with our Right Now product, specialization around sales with our Fusion Sales product as we go against our [secular] competitors, Workday and Salesforce.com and the others.","So I think in the third quarter we saw very good growth. We saw very, very good growth in the cloud. That was not the issue. When I talk about the cloud, I\u2019m talking very specifically about the SaaS portion of the cloud. We\u2019re in all aspects of the cloud. We\u2019re in infrastructure, we\u2019re in platform, and we\u2019re in SaaS. But when we give you a billion dollar number, that\u2019s a billion dollar pure SaaS number. And that\u2019s growing very, very nicely.","The problem is it\u2019s still a relatively small business with a very, very high growth rate. We are focusing on that, and we\u2019re getting a very good result there against the competition. Our win rates are going up versus Q2, the growth is excellent, but we think it would be [deploying] a lot of resources on that, to get those win rates, and get that focus, but the business is still relatively small compared to our overall $40 billion business.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs  ","This question is for Mark. You and Safra both highlighted sales execution as the reason for the shortfall this quarter, after posting a strong Q2. I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us a sense of how long you think the transition looks like. Is it one quarter or two quarters? And as a follow up, what does the ramp look like as execution improves?","Mark Hurd ","Well, I\u2019ll just say we expect it to be within the context of Q4, so we saw many of the deals that we described are closed. So we expect it to be relatively quick. On the ramp, and I think, Heather, what you mean is the ramp of the sales people that turn into pipeline and turn into growth, and if it\u2019s not I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s the question I\u2019m going to answer.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs ","Yeah, that\u2019s it exactly.","Mark Hurd ","Okay. So I think it really is just about the speed of getting our conversion continuing to decline. So our pipeline is behaving. I wouldn\u2019t say linear to the hires, but the way you would expect it to. You would expect a timeframe for a new hire to come onboard, get trained, get assimilated, get engaged with our management.","And I would say the pipeline is behaving roughly as you would expect relative to the ramp of those sales resources. So when you hear Safra and I talk about the pipeline, we measure it very closely, and we see it there. So it\u2019s just a question of how we convert, and I won\u2019t go into the role of predicting revenue growth rates out several quarters, other than to tell you that we have a lot more coverage, and we have a pipeline that\u2019s growing substantively.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch ","As it pertains to this quarter, Mark, I\u2019m just curious, when you ended up the November quarter, could there have been a chance that we saw some business being pulled in, potentially, as customers were somewhat leery of this fiscal cliff, a whole bunch of extraneous concerns that might have actually caused some deals to get done a little bit earlier than expected, which obviously benefitted your November quarter. I\u2019m just curious to see if you think that it could be an attribution to what happened in the February quarter.","And also just wondering if you have any thoughts on how to think about the growth rate of engineered systems. I think you have characterized it as paying 70-80%, maybe potentially doubling. I just wanted to see how we are tracking toward that goal for this year.","Mark Hurd ","I think the answer to your first question is sure. There\u2019s potential deals going that were in Q2. It was better. Some deals go to Q4. I mean, I think there\u2019s all kinds of things you get to. What we do know is we\u2019ve got a lot of deals in the pipeline. And we\u2019re in good shape on those deals.","And I mentioned, in the context, I think the better way to look at it is that we don\u2019t just measure the pipe. There\u2019s two different ways to measure a pipe when it concludes. One is the conversion rate, meaning the aggregate pipe and how it converts to orders. The second way to look at it is the win rate in the context of the deals that do get decided in [unintelligible]. And our win rate went up in the context of the conversion rates going down. So it\u2019s an important thing to measure, because some of it\u2019s our activity in the time that a decision gets made.","And engineered systems, unit count was great, as you heard Larry and I both mention. We had an ASP decline, not because of unit count, but because of the average selling price and the movement to conversions or to a one-eighth rack, which actually brings the average selling price down. Unit count, I think we\u2019re roughly in line with the numbers that we described today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo ","I want to tackle this maybe from a different angle. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of customer adoption of Fusion? What are you seeing in terms of uptake, at least within the installed base, upgrades, number of go-lives? How\u2019s that trending across verticals and product lines, and how does that bake into your equation for closure rates in the next couple quarters and getting confidence with new customers to buy this whole broad suite of apps?","Larry Ellison ","Great question, and it\u2019s interesting, we monitor this very, very closely. In HCM alone, we have 30 customers going live in the next six weeks. And that\u2019s very, very important. And that\u2019s extremely important as our reference base increases. These are relatively new businesses for us. So our reference base is greatly expanded in HCM. And that\u2019s one of our main focus areas. Like services, like sales is. So our win rates against Workday are going up, as Mark pointed out. We follow our secular competitors very closely. We look at every competitive deal. We measure our win rates. And those win rates against Workday are going up.","We actually have a new and improved UI coming out for all of our cloud apps. It\u2019s a change in our middleware platform, so automatically that UI suddenly appears in all of our cloud products. So we\u2019ve improved the UI. So we have a lot more references coming on, the technology continues to advance. The UI is making a giant step forward, so we are encouraged that our ability to compete and win in the marketplace is getting better every month.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","I wanted to go look a little bit beyond the quarter, and what we saw this quarter was obviously, and Q3, the announcement of the acquisition of Acme Packet. That gets you deeper into the telco plumbing. Can you talk a little bit about your motivation and strategy for this vertical?","Larry Ellison ","We have a very, very significant presence in billing systems, in provisioning systems, in the telco space. And what we\u2019d like to become is one of the most strategic suppliers to telcos overall, which involves broadening our footprint of what we supply them.","So you\u2019re going to see us, through our own engineering, through innovation and acquisitions, greatly broaden our footprint as our ambition is to be the primary technology provider to the telecommunications industry. So that\u2019s an area where we\u2019ve been very successful, in certain parts of it, and we think we can expand that business by adding to the footprint.","And you\u2019re going to see us adopt a similar strategy in retail and in financial services. Combination of innovation and acquisitions to broaden our footprint, become more and more strategic to telecommunications companies, more and more strategic to retailers, more and more strategic to the banks, as we can solve more of the problems.","Mark Hurd ","You know, I\u2019m really glad you asked that question, because when we announced the acquisition it was during our quiet period, and most of the people that wrote about it wrote about it as a horizontal networking acquisition and what we were doing was exactly what Larry described. Phone companies have two networks, or two sets of IT systems, those that manage the business, and those that manage the network. And this was an opportunity for us to get into that network side of the business, if you will, open up an entirely new opportunity for us strategically inside the phone companies, and leverage our existing go-to-market, our existing assets, and our existing relationships. So we look at this as just a fantastic acquisition to build on our assets that exist already in CGB, CGB being our communications [unintelligible].","Operator","Our final question will come from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities ","Safra, you mentioned that maintenance attach rates were at the best levels in Q3 than you\u2019ve seen in five years. What do you think is driving that attach, and what are you seeing in terms of pricing and competition around maintenance?","Safra Catz ","Well, as a general matter, really the only place to get the updates for your products, in addition to the product support, is from Oracle, and so as a general matter, customers know that the value they\u2019re getting from the licenses that they bought often years ago is when they upgrade, and when they get all the new features. And there\u2019s quite a lot of interest in making sure folks are staying current, especially as they\u2019re looking at their data centers, etc. And as a result, I think we\u2019ve just continued to offer them fantastic value and we are the place for them to get the updates that they need.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to today\u2019s presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Ken Bond","Thank you, operator. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the investor relations department with any follow up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us, and with that, we\u2019ll close the call."],"16301":["Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) Q1 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call September 17, 2018  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Ken Bond - SVP","Larry Ellison - Chairman and CTO","Safra Catz - CEO","Mark Hurd - CEO","Analysts","Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI","Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie","Brad Zelnick - Credit Suisse","John DiFucci - Jefferies and Company","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Mark Moerdler - Sanford Bernstein","Phil Winslow - Wells Fargo","Michael Turits - Raymond James","Presentation","Operator","Welcome to Oracle\u2019s First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn today\u2019s call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Victoria. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.","On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.","As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today.","As a result, we caution you from placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll first go over Q1 before moving on to my guidance. I\u2019ll then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.","Once again, we had another solid quarter. Constant currency revenue growth was slightly above the midpoint of my guidance and earnings per share was $0.03 above the midpoint of my guidance. As in prior quarters, I\u2019ll review our non-GAAP results, using constant dollar growth rates because that\u2019s how we also look at the business.","Total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $6.6 billion, up 4% in constant currency. This accounted for 72% of total Company revenue and the bulk of it is recurring revenues. In terms of ecosystems, GAAP applications total revenues were $2.8 billion, up 7%, and GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenues were $4.7 billion, up 2%.","Dwelling in a little, total cloud revenues grew in all regions and in terms of product categories, ERP grew in the 30% plus, verticals grew in the 40% plus and public cloud, PaaS and IaaS grew in the 20-plus-percent. Mark will have much more detail when he speaks.","Total revenues for the quarter were $9.2 billion, up 2% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 3% from last year and the operating margin was 41%, same as last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.1%, slightly below our base rate of 20% and our non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 in U.S. dollars and up 19% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 10.8% and GAAP EPS was $0.57 in U.S. dollars and up 16% in constant currency.","Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was a record $15.5 billion. Over the same four quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion [Audio Gap] of which approximately 64% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.","We remain committed to creating value for our shareholders through internal investments, and targeted acquisitions, as well as with stock repurchases and dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 212 million shares for a total of $10 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 440 million shares and reduced the absolute shares outstanding by over 8.5%, while growing free cash flow 10%. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by an additional $12 billion and again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.","Now, before I go to guidance, a quick comment on ASC 606, which we adopted this quarter. The estimated $86 million affect to Q1 of last year FY18 revenues, which we had posted on our website last quarter, ended up being $83 million, instead of $86 million. So, basically, about right.","Turning to currency. Exchange rates have moved from a 1% headwind to now being a 2% headwind to revenue, and $0.01 to $0.02 headwind to earnings per share, depending on rounding. Now, I\u2019m not sure what it will be by the end of this quarter. So, with that the guidance.","Total revenues are expected to grow from 0% to 2% in constant currency, because we have a tough comparison with last year\u2019s revenue, especially license. I expect second half revenue growth will be higher. Also, we remain committed to delivering a higher revenue growth rate for all of fiscal year 2019 when compared to that of last fiscal year. Assuming current exchange rate, non-GAAP EPS for Q2 in USD is expected to grow between 11% to 15% and be between $0.77 and $0.79. And non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 12% to 16% and be between $0.78 and $0.80. Once again, we expect to deliver double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth for fiscal year 2019.","My EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base rate, but I expect that normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2019.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry for his comments.","Larry Ellison","Okay. Thanks Safra.","All right. Oracle has two strategic products that will determine our future. Our cloud ERP product is the strategic key to our success in the SaaS applications layer of the cloud. And our autonomous cloud database is the strategic key to our success in the IaaS or infrastructure layer of the cloud.","Oracle is already number one in ERP cloud market share with over 20,000 Fusion and NetSuite customers. Customers are buying Fusion ERP to replace their existing SAP on-premise ERP systems. And customers are buying Fusion ERP to replace their existing Workday cloud ERP system.","ERP is the largest segment in the application business. Continuing our rapid growth in cloud ERP market puts Oracle well on its way to becoming the world\u2019s largest SaaS applications company. That\u2019s our strategy and current market position in the SaaS layer of the cloud. In the IaaS or infrastructure layer of the cloud, we have the world\u2019s most popular and technically most advanced database, the Oracle Autonomous Database.","The Oracle database is so much better than other databases. Even our biggest competitors use it to run their businesses. Salesforce.com uses Oracle to run their Sales Automation Cloud. SAP uses the Oracle database to run their cloud services and nearly all their on-premise customers. Even Amazon uses the Oracle database to run most of their business.","Now that the Oracle Autonomous Database is running in our second generation Bare Metal Cloud infrastructure, customers can both lower their labor costs and cut their Amazon bill in half by running the Oracle database on Oracle cloud infrastructure. The Oracle Autonomous Database automatically catches itself while running, it prevents data theft. No other database can do that. We think these are compelling advantages with the Amazon infrastructure business. We think these compelling advantages will allow us to compete very effectively against Amazon in the infrastructure business. Today, we may be behind Amazon in infrastructure market share, but we are way ahead of Amazon in cloud infrastructure technology. We think that will allow us to gain market share in infrastructure in the cloud very, very rapidly.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark Hurd.","Mark Hurd","Thanks, Larry.","I\u2019ll give you a few numbers and then few wins in the quarter. First, our apps ecosystem. 91% of our trailing 12 months revenue is now recurring in apps ecosystem with GAAP apps ecosystem now greater than $11 billion in trailing 12 months revenue, up 7% in the quarter. We\u2019re growing faster than market with, as Larry mentioned, an enormous opportunity ahead of us. Nearly two thirds of applications support revenue for Oracle is ERP or HCM with most on-premise customers at very early stage of moving those back office apps to the cloud. I do expect our apps ecosystem to grow roughly double digits for this year.","In SaaS, Safra after mentioned a few numbers, let me give you a few more. Overall, ERP and HCM now annualized revenue is greater than $2.5 billion. Fusion ERP was up 40% in revenue organically. NetSuite ERP had a spectacular quarter. Revenue -- as I think we\u2019ve mentioned through previous call, the momentum we\u2019ve been seeing in NetSuite. We were up 26% in revenue, and bookings were almost up 40%, 39% in the quarter. That follows on bookings growth that was greater than, call it roughly 70% for NetSuite in Q4. Our verticals were up 41%, and annualized revenue is now $800 million.","Our tech ecosystem in GAAP is now greater than $21 billion on a trailing 12 months basis, and Q1 was up 2%. Bring Your Own License continues to perform well as both Q1 database new license and support revenue were up mid single digits.","Now, I\u2019m going to shift to talking about a few customer wins in the quarter. I\u2019m going to try to keep it to a few. But, I want to give you a flavor for some of the wins that -- on top of what we did in Q4 what we did in Q1, and talk first about ERP and what we did in that category.","First, Academy Sports, a nice win for us in North America. Airbnb, they bought ERP. And Larry mentioned. This is actually a replacement of Workday Financials at Airbnb. Conn's, they\u2019re retailer, very nice win for us. They also bought not just ERP, but bought HCM as well as a package back office deal in the quarter. Legg Mason, many of you may know is an investment advisor. Legg Mason bought ERP in the quarter. That also was a replacement of Workday Financials.","I\u2019ll talk a little bit about a company called Federal Express. FedEx is -- in the FedEx side of the house, a traditional Oracle user, they bought a company called TNT in Europe that was an SAP user, and they are now going to standardize all of their ERP on Oracle Fusion ERP. In addition to that, they bought Payroll from us in the quarter. They happened to be a Workday HCM customer but bought Payroll from Oracle. This is one of the most significant transactions we\u2019ve had over a course of a number of significant transactions, but a very strategic and significant one with a replacement of SAP as a combination of a migration of an existing Oracle customer. A few other customers, City of Sunnyvale; Equity Bank in Europe; the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation bought ERP. Still on ERP, just to be clear. Highmark Health, Noble Corporation, that\u2019s a big oil and gas driller, $4 billion or $5 billion company, nice win for us in the quarter. Santander Consumer, part of their business is going to Oracle ERP. Saudi Telecom, another combination ERP, HCM customer in the quarter. The State of Nebraska. TIAA, another investment firm, again another ERP win the quarter.","Talk a little bit about HCM. VITAS Hospice Healthcare bought also a bit of ERP in the quarter, a relatively large HCM transaction for us in the quarter; Canon that many of you will also know; Allnex, manufacturing company in Europe; Fortis, significant customer of HCM win; the government of Saskatchewan; Marriott, one of the biggest HCM transactions that we\u2019ve ever taken down, we took down in the quarter as well.","I thought I\u2019d mentioned at the same time, another back office category that is becoming more significant for us, which is supply chain management. Our HCM product has been out now a while. The number of customers is now again significant. Prospect Medical healthcare company; Rotary International; Academy Sports, again as you can see, a portfolio deal for us in ERP in the quarter; Beckman Coulter, $6 billion company going to Oracle supply chain management and the Cloud; City of Sunnyvale, which I mentioned earlier; Noble Energy, which you saw me mention earlier; Zebra Technologies, which I mentioned earlier.","So, again significant amount, as you can tell in the back office. Once you win ERP Financials, the opportunity then to HCM and supply chain management is significant. I thought I\u2019d close by just mentioning a few infrastructure wins at the end of quarter. And these are both infrastructure and PaaS wins.","AIG; Emerson Electric; Hermes Parcelnet; Nuance Communications; Network Rail; Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company; Swiss Re; Toronto Dominion; Standard Industries. And I thought I\u2019d also mention a couple of ISVs. I traditionally don\u2019t talk about ISVs as much. But, in the quarter three significant ISVs, FICO, Asseco and HighJump. HighJump is the leading provider of supply chain software management and warehouse, advantage and some of it -- they\u2019ll be using our platform and our cloud to deliver their applications into the market. Asseco is an e-commerce payment platform. FICO is a leading analytics software company in the personalization space. All will be using Oracle PaaS platform as the base by which they bring software to market.","With that I\u2019ll close by just saying, listen, our pipeline is, as you can tell by these -- I hope you can tell by these wins, our SaaS pipeline is at a record level, and to Larry\u2019s point, led by both ERP. And that\u2019s not just Fusion now, but the NetSuite improvement is material and significant. Our pipeline in PaaS is also at the highest level it\u2019s been. And it was overall solid quarter for us. Looking forward to Safra\u2019s point earlier, we do expect revenue growth in the second half to be higher than last year and EPS will grow double digits for the year.","With that I\u2019ll give it back to Ken and then we\u2019ll take your questions.","Ken Bond","Thanks, Mark. Victoria, if you\u2019ll now please instruct the audience on the questions, we\u2019ll go ahead and get started Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much. I just had a question for Mark regarding the applications business. Obviously, you spent a lot of time outlining some of the wins this quarter. Can you just unpack maybe a little bit more your confidence in terms of the business, heading into the rest of the year? I\u2019m just kind of curious, how much of that comes from maybe some of your existing customers finally moving on to the cloud in terms of the ERP and maybe HCM areas, and just your confidence that the improvement in NetSuite you saw this quarter is sustainable, as we go forward from here? Thanks.","Mark Hurd","I just don\u2019t know what words I can use to get -- to show more confidence in the apps business than what I\u2019ve done. I think, the NetSuite performance is sort of -- Kirk, what I\u2019d describe it is sort of the best of NetSuite and best of Oracle combined. We\u2019ve had significant -- I think the management team in NetSuite has done a great job. Our attrition is down. We\u2019ve also been able to supplement the NetSuite sales organization, with our traditional recruiting, our traditional college hires. And frankly, they\u2019ve done a fantastic job incubating them, absorbing them and getting them productive. They probably wouldn\u2019t have done this as a public company because of short-term quarterly earnings per share requirements. We invested in them. I think I\u2019ve mentioned that before, both in R&D and in sales. And to be very blunt with you, it\u2019s paid off. The Q4 bookings numbers were spectacular that translated to Q1 revenue growth. Their Q1 bookings were a little bit ahead of the plan that I\u2019ve had for them. And so, again, when you have this sort of bookings growth back to back, we can pretty much predict, not perfectly but pretty close to what the annual revenue is going to be. And I expect that as I\u2019ve said, I think in the Q4 call, they will accelerate their revenue growth from last year to this year. And it\u2019s going to be relatively material, call it 7, 8, 9, 10 points of growth rate. I\u2019m talking about growth rate comparisons year-over-year.","In the traditional Oracle business and the Fusion business, I don\u2019t know what more I can do to read you these list of customers. I mean, this is just a broad set of customers across regions. And now, that we\u2019re bringing on both supply chain, as I tried to mention and outlined a few supply chain win supplemented by now the maturation in our manufacturing. The great news about this business is most of the people we compete with aren\u2019t in a great position to bring their customers to the cloud. If you will, I\u2019m saying now, Kirk, the traditional ERP on-premise spenders. So, our HCM business I talked about. So, my confidence level in the apps ecosystem is pretty hot. 91% of our revenue, as I mentioned is recurring. So, our ability to predict our pipeline, our conversion rates are quite high. The morale of our -- listen, let me end it this way. Our team here at Oracle believes, their destiny is to win every deal. That\u2019s how they -- they believe that we\u2019re going position - from a technology perspective to be in a position to win virtually every deal. And that\u2019s the attitude we go into with this. And so, long answer to tell you, confidence on my side is really high, shows up in our pipeline and our results.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie.","Sarah Hindlian","Mark, Kirk asked about the apps ecosystem, and you\u2019re clearly bullish on that. But can you talk to us a little bit about some of the bookings trends you\u2019re seeing in the overall tech ecosystem? And then, as a follow-up, Mark. I\u2019d really appreciate it, if you could let me know what\u2019s going on with Thomas Kurian and provide us with some sort of an update. That would be greatly appreciated.","Mark Hurd","I got the second question. I think the first question was bookings trends?","Sarah Hindlian","It\u2019s really around cloud bookings.","Mark Hurd","Okay. All right. I got it. First, I\u2019d say, we try to give you as much clarity as I can. In our next-gen PaaS infrastructure business, we\u2019re talking about mid-20s sort of growth rate in bookings. Early days, to sort of Larry\u2019s point, but very encouraging in terms of these sort of short term results we have. When you start seeing these early indicators, ISVs move. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I outlined the ISVs. This is really good news because ISVs are some of the most discriminating. It\u2019s sort of like our GBUs. They\u2019re probably the biggest ISV I know of. And their excitement to move to what Larry\u2019s describing is our Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is how fast can we get that done. And now, when you see other ISVs lining up, these are very strong indicators to us of our future as it relates to OCI. And nobody can do what we can do with the Oracle database OCI that Larry already mentioned that.","I think I talked about the SaaS bookings growth. Our bookings overall in cloud for the quarter accelerated on a rate basis. The growth rate accelerated. So, that was obviously a good indication for us of overall bookings growth. Again, I\u2019m trying to focus here more on the revenue in long run is I think the best indicator of where we are. Bookings to us -- it was a good description before we have revenue. And so, what I\u2019m trying to do now is keep you focused on really what the prize is, because if the bookings don\u2019t translate to revenue, they don\u2019t mean anything to us. So, we\u2019re trying to get very focused on revenue. That has a couple other aspects to us, which is also our renewal rates, making sure our renewal rates, we believe are continuing to improve, if you start looking at our renewal rates as they go forward. So, the combination of bookings and renewals going up gives us a better revenue outlook.","On Thomas Kurian, which I think was your question. Thomas is a good guy, works hard. He\u2019s taken a break and we expect him back.","Sarah Hindlian","That\u2019s very helpful. Is there a timeline on when he\u2019ll be back or is it just some kind of over the next few months something along those lines?","Mark Hurd","I\u2019ll stick to what I said. He\u2019s taken a break. We expect him back.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.","Brad Zelnick","I\u2019ve got one for Larry and a quick follow-up for Safra. Larry, with the introduction of autonomous database, you\u2019ve committed to a more accelerated innovation cycle. And you now have the next major database version 19c just around the corner? How do you envision the newer cadence impacting customer adoption patterns, and ultimately the purchasing cycle?","Larry Ellison","Well, I think people are moving to the cloud infrastructure. Again, it\u2019s very early days. So, there are two things that are going on. We\u2019re delivering our technology in the cloud prior to making it available on-premise. It just allows us to -- it's just easier to get our cloud product out and make it available to a large number of customers for their -- for development of new applications, for the lift and shift of existing applications. So, a lot of our customers are now experimenting with a data warehouse here and there\u2019s now an OLTP system that\u2019s available for -- with the autonomous database. And they\u2019re in the process now of trying it in the cloud. And we\u2019ve gotten a lot of people that were very, very surprised. We had very positive feedback. I think the strangest one for me was someone who is running Exadata on-premise, which is theoretically the fastest system on which you can run the Oracle database. They moved it to the Oracle Autonomous Database cloud, which by the way also runs on Exadata in the cloud and they got a 5 times performance increase. It\u2019s simply that the machine learning tuning for the autonomous database is just better than human beings. And they were shocked. And so, now, they\u2019re moving additional workloads to the Oracle cloud.","I think, the fact that we can upgrade these things faster will actually increase the adoption rate. Albeit now, we got to confess, these are pretty early days. We have tens of thousands of database customers. An awful lot of them are now moving their first workloads and experimenting with their first workloads in the cloud. Once they get through that process, I think we\u2019ll have a very, very rapid migration of workloads from on-premise into the Oracle cloud.","Mark Hurd","Just to add numbers to Larry\u2019s point. I mean, if you look at the quarter, I said, we have mid-single-digit growth in database license and database support. The real driver of that was the options that come along with autonomous database. The multi-tenant Active Data Guard at the RAC were really the leading drivers of that growth.","Larry Ellison","Yes. I\u2019d like to just follow up on what Mark said. People are bringing their own database license to the cloud. So, what we\u2019re seeing is, they want to use autonomous database in the cloud. Autonomous database requires the multi-tenancy option and it requires real application clustering option. And they\u2019re trying it. They try it, they\u2019re getting great performance, they\u2019re going terrific availability. They go back and then to do a license deal where they acquire the pieces that are missing on multi-tenancy and real application clusters, and then they lift their entire license from on-premise and move it to the cloud. And we think that\u2019s maybe the vast majority of our cloud. Our database cloud customers are going to be taking their existing on-premise license, augmenting it with certain new features required for autonomous database and then buying the infrastructure piece in the cloud while bringing their own license.","Brad Zelnick","Thanks very much, very helpful color. And just quickly for Safra, we continue to see you express a strong opinion on the value of your stock, buying back $10 billion worth of shares this quarter and the additional authorization as well. How should we think about the rate and pace of buybacks versus other uses of cash going forward? Thanks.","Safra Catz","We think our stock is an unbelievable buy, so we are buying back. And I\u2019m not going to tell you exactly how much, but you can see I\u2019ve got $20 billion in authorization, which I\u2019ll use up when I use it. But, at these prices with our growing cash flows, with our earnings growing like they are, it seems like an amazing deal to buy our stock. So, we\u2019re putting our money where our mouth is, frankly.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of John DiFucci with Jefferies and Company.","John DiFucci","Thank you. My question is for Safra. Safra, cash flow grew last year for the first time in several years. So, I guess two questions on cash flow. One, this quarter operating cash flow was up modestly and free cash flow was flat. Was there anything affecting cash flow this quarter relative to a year ago? And then, to two, -- I\u2019ll let you answer that first.","Safra Catz","Yes. Let\u2019s do this one at a time. So -- by the way, operating cash flow was record, okay, both latest 12 months and in the quarter. A couple of things that move around that I don\u2019t know, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have visibility into, which is how much of a tax deduction we get, when our employees exercise their options. And compared to last year, there\u2019s $300 million plus difference, so less of that in addition, with lower tax rates. The value of that is lower. So, I expect that you\u2019re going to see operating cash flow and cash flows in general continue to increase, because our business is growing now. And at any one time, you may see some seasonality within the working capital line, but -- when we do, for example, a tax payment or something like that, but other than that, you should see an overall line going in an upward direction.","John DiFucci","Thank you. That\u2019s my second question. So you answered it. Thanks a lot.","Safra Catz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Great, thank you. I had a question Safra for you. Given Mark had great comments to say about the cloud business. But I\u2019m wondering, is it safe to assume that the software support revenue is continuing to grow? And then, my follow-up question is also, if you could share any color on trends that you\u2019ve seen in short-term deferred revenue in the quarter? Thank you.","Safra Catz","Okay. So, yes. You should assume that support is growing. Our base continues to grow. And as far as short-term deferred revenue was let\u2019s say about $10.35 billion. And the reality is that gross deferred was up about 4%. We net it down quite a bit in the quarter for uncollected invoices. So, invoices had been sent out mostly for Q4 bookings and things like that which are as yet uncollected. We net down; other folks don\u2019t net down. And so, that\u2019s our short-term deferred revenue. Going great.","Mark Hurd","One thing on support, Heather, I know you know this, but just to be clear, there is multiple things going on inside support. Database support is growing. So, it\u2019s growing rather nicely, and our renewal rates are inclining slightly. So, you they\u2019re very high. But this quarter, we had just slight incline as we did in apps. But apps support revenue is declining and will continue to decline if we do our job, because our job is to move them to the cloud, to move them to SaaS. And so, when you ask that question, I don\u2019t want to give the wrong impression, if somebody who\u2019s looking for every line of support to grow, we\u2019re actually working against that.","Heather Bellini","No, no, I just meant the net of it, like the database where you said it\u2019s growing rather nicely; apps is declining, but net of it is that total...","Mark Hurd","That is true. I just want to make sure you know that we\u2019re seeing an incline, meaning that if you looked actually at our renewal rates, and I\u2019d like you to know this that as a percent of what we get cancelled, more of that cancellation whatever is moving to our cloud. So, actually, our net cancellation rate is actually declining in apps as well, but the driver of that is the movement to our cloud. So, I just want to make sure that we didn\u2019t leave you with wrong\u2026","Heather Bellini","Just to be clear, Mark. Did you say that database support attach rate is increasing?","Safra Catz","Attach rate, it\u2019s a 100%. It\u2019s just about renewals and database. Database installed base continues to grow.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler of Sanford Bernstein.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you for taking my call. I\u2019ve got a question for you. Cloud Services and license support was slightly less than what the street had expected. Can you drill in, help us better understand, if you had weakness, where that weakness was? Was it maintenance, was it PaaS, was it IaaS, was it SaaS? How should we think about that? I\u2019d appreciate.","Safra Catz","Well, I think most of -- any kind of what miss from the numbers you have was that in fact there was really just some currency difference between when I gave my guidance and when and what it ended up being. So, it was basically double the negative that I was expecting.","Mark Hurd","I\u2019d say -- so, to be very blunt with you, I\u2019d say, relative to Safra\u2019s point, when she gave the guidance, when we said in the room, relative to that number on that line you\u2019re talking about, Oracle\u2019s performance in Q1 beat that number. Now, the implication of currency during the quarter moved on us from the time we mentioned it to the time we reported. So, again, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in everybody\u2019s model, but relative to our view, we did better in that line and we did based on our on our forecast at the end of the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.","Phil Winslow","Mark, you highlighted mid-single-digit growth in database license and support. Just a competitive question for both you and Larry here. What are you seeing in terms of competitive environment in database in particularly, because we obviously get questions about no NoSQL players, and what ACID compliance means there with some of them achieving that and then, your cloud vendors as well such as Amazon with them announcing bringing RDS on-premise? So, just competitive environment there would be great.","Larry Ellison","Yes. Again, we think we have a very, very large lead in technology. Now, there might be a reason why you decide to use a database, it\u2019s not as good. If you\u2019re committed the Amazon cloud and you\u2019re getting a lot of stuff at the Amazon cloud and Amazon sells Redshift or Amazon sells a number of different databases, right. Aurora is actually the MySQL database that we\u2019re responsible for. So, people tell I\u2019m going to use whatever Amazon has in the cloud. And there a number of people do that. And that happened to us in the previous generation when a lot of people chose to use Microsoft\u2019s database because the content was easily available with Windows. So, we do see that. We weren\u2019t -- we\u2019re not the only database around. However, in terms of technology, if you want the highest performance, if you want the highest reliability, if you want the highest security and if you want the lower cost, the performance translates into cost. The reason the Oracle database is much cheaper than the Amazon database is because Amazon charges per minute. We charge per minute. If we can do more in one minute, twice as much in one minute than they can, we\u2019re half the price.","So, we think, while people will go to the Amazon cloud and buy whatever is there as part of Amazon infrastructure, anyone who\u2019s actually shopping for the best database, in terms of reliability, in terms of ease of use, in terms of lowest cost, they\u2019re all going to take Oracle.","Mark Hurd","So, numerically, just to end it, you\u2019re growing mid-single-digits. You have half the market and the market is growing 3, I don\u2019t know, you must have gained a point share. So, it\u2019s just all the points we talk about. I mean, we just -- all these different names you mentioned, and Larry talked about the technical part of these; numerically, it\u2019s just hard to dispute the evidence that over the past year, two years, rolling eight quarters we just gained share.","Operator","Our final question comes from line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.","Michael Turits","Mark, question for you on the vertical markets. How are they doing and how are you doing in terms of moving those vertical applications to cloud, how\u2019d you expect that to impact the cloud growth rate?","Mark Hurd","Well, I think the vertical businesses are continuing to make - I made a comment in my script about their growth in SaaS, being in excess of 40% for the quarter. So, that\u2019s a good number. They\u2019ve also now to the point where they\u2019re SaaS business is bigger than their license business. So, in terms of the pivot from an applications perspective, they\u2019ve done, I think a good job. Their license business -- within that license business, there\u2019s other opportunity for us to do more of hosting, if you will, some of that business on our OCI cloud. Again, I mentioned earlier, they\u2019re about the biggest ISV in the world from an applications perspective. And they are perhaps the absolute best ISV test case you could ever have for the applications running an OCI. And they are beginning that move to OCI or if you will, our next generation cloud infrastructure and it\u2019s going quite well. So, there\u2019s a combination of the SaaS growth, which is that 40% as I described, and then the movement of some of those applications to our OCI, if you will, if you will, a sort of a hosting part of the business, both going well. So, our vertical is growing, their license business by the way, still allows us to grow, support our vertical businesses. So, overall, quite healthy.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Mark. And a telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department for any follow-up question from this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thanks for joining us today.

At this time, I would like to introduce Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations, Oracle. Please go ahead, sir.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial table, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.","On the call today are President and Chief Financial Officer, Safra Catz; and President, Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements.

And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise the results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Ada Catz","Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2 and turn the call over to Mark for his comments. Larry isn't with us today because he is at an important race for the America's Cup.","I want to start by letting you know that currency in Q1 gave us a 2% headwind for new software license and total revenue, which was more than my guidance last quarter. So today, my comments on the quarter will generally reflect constant dollar growth rates.","Q1 for us was really solid overall and quite strong in the Americas. We're especially pleased with our software results, as total software revenues were $6.1 billion, up 8% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues were more than half of the total company revenue at nearly $4.4 billion, up 8% from last year. Attach rates and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels, and software updates and product support continue to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were $1.7 billion, up 6% from last year. Looking at GAAP results by region, we saw excellent results in the Americas with growth of 15%. That's growth upon a previous year, so that's really very strong. Asia-Pac saw solid growth of 5%, while EMEA declined 5%.","There were some interesting product details that I think bode well for the future. Exadata Software was up over 15%; GoldenGate in-memory software was up 30%; BI Technology and Foundation Suite were up around 10%. Also strong was retailing, CRM sales and applications in North America generally. The quarter wasn't dependent on any one large deal, anything like that, it was just a very solid quarter. Hardware systems product revenue was $669 million, as older products like the older M-series and Netra saw significant declines.","Storage was more a mixed story with TAPE down a bit, SAN down significantly, while network attached storage was up.","The Engineered Systems customer base continues to expand nicely. Exadata bookings look very good. Revenues from Exalytics, SuperCluster and the Oracle Database Appliance all grew over 100%.","For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $8.4 billion, up 4% from last year. Our non-GAAP operating income was $3.7 billion, which was 6% higher than last year, and operating margin expanded to 45%. We still believe there remains ample leverage in the business model.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%. EPS for the quarter grew 12% in U.S. dollars to $0.59 on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate was 7-point -- was 17.7%, which was lower than my guidance for last quarter due to some onetime event and the mix of earnings.","On a GAAP basis, EPS for the quarter was $0.47 in U.S. dollars, which was up 14%. Free cash flow increased to a record $14.2 billion over the last 4 quarters and to an all-time high of $6.1 billion for Q1, up 11% from last year. We're now on the cusp of generating more free cash flow than IBM. Just 5 years ago, we generated roughly half the level of IBM's free cash flow over 4 quarters.","We now have over $39 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is $15 billion. As we've said before, we are committed to returning the value to our shareholders through earnings growth, share repurchases and the dividend. This quarter we repurchased 92.8 million shares for a total of $3 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased nearly 335 million shares for a total of $10.9 billion, paid out dividends of nearly $1.7 billion for a total that is nearly 90% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share.","Now, to the guidance, and I want to remind you that last Q2, new license in cloud revenue increased 18% in constant currency. So this will be a very, very tough comparison. And though our pipelines and potential transactions for the quarter look really very exciting, our sales leaders remain very careful about what they are forecasting to us.","So new software license and cloud subscription revenue growth is expected to range from negative 4 to positive 6 in constant currency and negative 6 to positive 4 in reported dollars. Hardware product revenue is expected to range from negative 9% to positive 1% in constant dollars and negative 11% to negative 1% in reported dollars. As a result, total revenue growth on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 1% to 4% in constant dollars and negative 1 to positive 2 in U.S. dollars.","Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.65 and $0.70 in constant dollars, $0.64 to $0.69 in reported dollars. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.51 to $0.56 in constant dollars, and $0.50 to $0.55 in reported dollars. I want to remind you that last year, we had the benefit of a $145 million acquisition-related benefit for the Pillar earnout, so excluding that benefit, GAAP EPS last year would have been $0.51. This guidance assumes a tax rate of 23.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. Of course, it may end up being very different.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.","Mark V. Hurd","Yes. Thanks, Safra. Just a couple of things to add. Our new license executed really as we expected. The Americas had a solid quarter, as Safra mentioned. 15% growth, with both the U.S. and Latin America growing double digits and Asia-Pac came back strong with growth of 5%.","Database continues to be very strong, double-digit growth again this quarter. Now, while customer activity on 12c was excellent, it really is the traditional products. Database Options, Enterprise Manager that drove this double-digit growth. And we've seen that trend in the last 3 of the last -- or 3 of the last 4 quarters.","And cloud right now had a strong quarter. It's really started to hit stride, with great wins at A&A, LinkedIn, SIRIUS XM Radio, Telus, Barclays Bank, and we're also really excited about our Sales Automation Release 7. Not only will the entire Oracle sales force run on Release 7, but we're very excited to bring this to market.","In HCM, our Taleo product had a very strong quarter with key wins at Honeywell, Emerson, Humana, Xilinx and DIRECTV. And last quarter, we teased you a little bit with announcements we've made, and then we made them in June. We announced the deal with Microsoft enabling customers to run Java in the Oracle Database on the user cloud. And we'd also be partnering with NetSuite on HCM. And lastly, we announced a comprehensive partnership with salesforce where they've chosen to power their cloud with the Oracle 12c database and Exadata amongst Oracle -- other Oracle products. We expect others to follow suit.","Moving to Engineered Systems, we have great wins at Eton, Telecom Italia, China Mobile, SunGard, Ingersoll Rand and Hitachi. In the last 2 quarters, we have shipped almost 2,000 systems. And this quarter, we saw great unit growth north of 60% as we shipped nearly 800 systems. Nearly 40% of Exadata Systems were sold to new customers, and we expect to grow our business with these customers over time. We're gaining a material amount of unit market share. Exalytics, SPARC SuperCluster, the Oracle Database Appliance all had growth in excess of 100%.","Lastly, our sales org in terms of salespeople is up. We're making investments in productivity to make them sell more. We're growing faster than our key competitors, and our attrition is down from historical levels and down significantly from last year.","Now with that, I thought I'd make a couple of comments about Oracle OpenWorld, which is next week. We plan to have roughly 60,000 people at the event in San Francisco from 145 countries. We expect to have 2 million attendees online. So this is going to be the biggest one yet. We've got a great lineup of speakers. We've got EMC, Dell, Michael Epps [ph] will be there. We've got Fujitsu, Deloitte, Intel there. We've got customers: LinkedIn, AT&T, Facebook, Electronics Arts, Thomson Reuters, New York Stock Exchange, Tesco, Deutsche Telekom. I could just go on. It's going to be a great set of people from the industry, as well as customers, a very large attendee base. And we will make some significant product announcements at the event as well. We'll be introducing Oracle 12c in-memory database. We'll be talking about it being able to deliver 100x faster application performance using our new architectural approach. We'll talking about -- we'll be talking about existing Oracle apps that can now run in the Oracle Database functionality without change when using this in-memory capability. We'll have some releases in cloud. We'll talk about we'll have some releases in HCM and talent management, we'll talk about database as a service, Java as a service that will be available to our customers. So there'll be a whole slew of product announcements there that Larry will be talking about Sunday night and will continue on through the week. So we're excited about the upcoming activities at Oracle OpenWorld.","With that, I'll turn it back to Ken, and we'll take whatever questions you've got.","Ken Bond","Brian, we'll go to the Q&A now if you're ready.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll now take our first question from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Mark, you mentioned the strength in database and it's reflected in license. But it's also, I think, reflected in margins this quarter. And you mentioned, and I would think it's really too early for 12c to be having much of an impact on the numbers anyway. You mentioned Options, Enterprise Manager. I guess the question is why the strength right now in database, and how does this business look as we look forward at the core database with Options?","Mark V. Hurd","The interesting thing, John, first is we not only had good growth in database but we also had good growth in database in the U.S. So it was very strong. It's exactly what you described. First, it was broad-based across the regions even with a strong showing in the U.S. And it was really the options. And again, as you start dealing with some of the issues you see in the market, take for example something as simple as the data growth that you all hear in the industry. 30%, 40% data growth that our customers talk about. The ability for us to compress that data is a tremendous opportunity and it's an option that you can get advanced compression, you can get it with Exadata that dramatically changes our customers' total cost of ownership. So we had good growth really across regions, particularly strong in the U.S., particularly strong in Options. GoldenGate was very strong, we had good growth in RAC, Active Data, in-memory caching. Security was -- I mentioned this, I think, last quarter too, we had very strong growth again in security. And these are turning to be material businesses, John. And I think this is not really the beginning -- I would not call any of this really any significant impact from 12c. This is really just the core database and the options around the core database.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You mentioned Exadata. So that sounds like sort of that Exadata pulls along some of these options too, and that's having an effect here.","Mark V. Hurd","Well, it's all part -- yes, it's all part of one story, John, in the context of we've got so much database out there and you see the drive more performance, more security, drive more compression. You can get a lot of it with the database. It's a product; you can get even more of it when you buy Exadata. And so it's a strong value prop, John.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And if I might just one quick one for Safra. Safra, the guidance you gave is a little bit below where the Street is right now. You mentioned you talked about exciting pipelines I think the words that you used. But you also talked about manage - the salespeople or manage -- sales managers being, I don't know what word you used, but it sounded like being prudent. I guess, if you -- in the past, you sometimes gauged what that guidance is. Do you think that, that is something -- the guidance you've given, is it similar to the conservatism that is prudent that you normally give? Is it a little more conservative or less, or if you can comment on that?","Safra Ada Catz","Well, as I always say to you all, I read the same newspapers or read the websites that you all do, and there's a lot of news out there, whether it's coming out from our own government or from Europe. And that influences what we put at the backdrop for our forecast. And today was a big news day in both directions. And so we're just trying to -- I think everybody's just trying to stay a little bit to have a little bit of room, and we could do significantly better. But we still -- even though our pipelines are big, we still have to close all those deals. And I just can't assume that we will. So try to just be reasonable about it, be conservative about it. But I just need to take into account a lot of different inputs. And I think we -- that's where the guidance range is.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll now take our next question from Raimo Lenschow.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just had a topic around you guys had a conference call with salesforce a few weeks ago that focused on joining the different clouds. A few minutes ago, we had a call from 2 cloud vendors that want to work closer together going forward. Can you talk maybe a little bit about this new environment of vendors having to preintegrate their core products? And also maybe go on a little bit about Fusion, and it's a more complete solution than what others has. How is that done and how does that fit into the new world here?","Safra Ada Catz","Yes, Raimo, so first of all, I think that what you're seeing is that in fact, customers want systems that are integrated. And that I think works to our advantage. And it's significantly easier obviously to have very integrated and very seamless integration when you own all the products as we do for those customers that have mixed environments, especially the large installed base of one of our competitors. The big benefit, of course, in working with us is that it's all based on our technology. I think it gets significantly harder when you're talking about almost random companies who are trying to make the experience seamless when their systems are so very, very different, the definitions, the underlying platforms are very, very different. For us, we view this as a huge benefit towards us, and we think it's actually powering the strength of Fusion and the interest in Fusion as -- because Fusion actually has a second piece to it, which is it integrates; not only all of our applications work together in Fusion, but they also work with all of your existing Oracle applications in a way that if you -- and Fusion itself can be deployed, some on-premise if you like, and some in the cloud. And back and forth, in fact. So what you're seeing is customers wanting more choice but better integration, and we're really the only ones who have all the products and the depth and an ability to deliver it in the cloud, in the public cloud, in a private cloud behind their firewall or in our -- or on-premise, which is truly about customer choice.","Operator","And our next question from Joel Fishbein.","Joel P. Fishbein - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Mark, a quick question. As I was going through the numbers, it looked like hardware support's up 5% against hardware that's down 13%. Can you give me some -- or give us some more color on what's going on there?","Mark V. Hurd","Yes, I mean I said, Joel, it's, we've -- I talked about this in the past. I think that if you look historically when the hardware business was not part of Oracle, the attach of service to a unit, so you sell a unit and then you sell service with it. Historically, pre-Oracle, that was a very, very low number. And we realigned our business so that as we sort of shifted to these very high Oracle content products, we now attach support all the time. And as a result, the growth of support is not symmetrical with the product growth rate. And so what we do is having support now growing materially faster as we catch up to what I would argue would be industry norms in terms of the way you attach support to a product. And it's causing -- I understand your point. It doesn't look right that hardware support is growing now 5%. I might add our margins have improved dramatically with the growth rate. But it is because that we now have high Oracle content products, and we are attaching support to those products regularly when we sell them. And that is causing our hardware support to grow in a way that doesn't align directly to the hardware price. Now, I can tell it to you the other way, Joel, once we start growing the top line in hardware, that will even be a further catalyst to our hardware support. And because much of that cost in hardware is support, it's sort of a baseline set of costs to be in the business, things like parts depots and spare parts, you'll actually be in a position where you can make even more margin. So it's really, Joel, just us going back to the fundamentals of running a good hardware support business, and it starts with attaching the service and the support to the product when you sell it, which is what we've done.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brent Thill.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My question is on the general demand environment. And, Safra, I think you made a comment that you believe you could do significantly better. Overall, tax spending seems to be pretty positive yet your guidance, and we certainly respect the tough comp, is really for no license growth. So from your perspective, what are the key enablers for you to get back to what I would assume you would perceive to be more healthy growth in the license side? What key building blocks do you have to fill in from here?","Safra Ada Catz","We just have to execute and we have to avoid any kind of economic deterioration or things like that. Some of those things are out of our control. You just have to execute. We have to have another quarter just like this one, just straight execution, follow a straight line. I think we have an opportunity to do significantly better. But so we just want to move forward. It really does come down for this next quarter to being an extremely difficult comp.","Mark V. Hurd","I'd probably put a little different view on your comments. One, listen, to Safra's point, we read all of our peer groups' results. And to be very blunt, they're not very good. So depending on who you're talking about, most of their numbers are negative. So when you say there's a robust expending environment, I'm not sure whose numbers you're reading. So that's sort of point one. When you look at scale technology companies, there's some pretty significant headwinds out there when you certainly look in July through the June readouts. So when you look at this quarter, I would argue we, again, gained a lot of share just based on the results we just gave you. So I think what we're telling you out there is we see what's out there. We're trying to be prudent and thoughtful in the guidance we give. I don't think it's as much about the tough comp. I mean, tough comp is part of it. There's also a couple points of currency that are involved in the number that guided you to, to 0 as well. So that would be my view of it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jason Maynard.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I want to talk a little bit more about the hardware business. And Mark, if you could maybe give us a little bit of a drill-down into what's going on with the M and the T, and how you expect that to play out. Talk a little bit about what's going on with kind of the legacy products. And the last question would be are you still comfortable with seeing some growth this year in the overall hardware business, just on the product side?","Mark V. Hurd","Sure, thanks. Jason, I think we'll see -- we'll have some growth in hardware this year. I would say your question, which was primarily about the SPARC line. T was okay in the quarter, M was not. So as you know, in sort of Q4-ish timeframe, mid-Q4, we released a new set of M products we're pretty excited about. We've got a big installed base that we can move. It takes time to get those products certified and tested in customers' environments, but that's what happened in the numbers. We had the strong Exadata unit growth that both Safra and I described. We had very good results in several regions in our storage, if you will, our NAS storage business. TAPE was unexciting as it has been for a period of time, and the real issue was again in the M part of the SPARC line. That's really the story in hardware.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Heather Bellini.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up, Mark, a little bit on the response you gave to Brent just talking about the competitive environment. I was just wondering specifically if you could share with us kind of who -- what companies in particular kind of are you benchmarking yourself against or who are you benchmarking yourself against? And kind of how would you -- how do you kind of keep score versus those guys, if you will?","Mark V. Hurd","Well, that could take us a while. I think the -- let's start off with -- if you're looking at who our competitors are, Heather, we certainly compete in the infrastructure business with IBM. They would be a competitor. We certainly would compete to a part of the infrastructure business with EMC, probably to a lesser degree. Not so much in the head on storage business, but the fact that when we're dealing with data and management of data, you can see competition from that perspective. In the Applications business, clearly SAP on a global basis, they would be a competitor. And then in addition to that, you have competitors, I'd say, even like salesforce and Workday now, albeit that they're mostly North American and that they're mostly in one process: Workday and HR and salesforce and sales automation. We still view them as competitors. Now, I could go down a slew of others in various product groups, but those would be the big ones that I would describe to you, Heather.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rich Sherlund.","Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Mark, the headcount, you're up about 9% in Americas year-over-year and you're up about 3% in the rest of the world. You showed good license growth in the Americas. I'm sort of curious what's behind the headcount growth in Americas versus the rest of the world. Are you ramping sales headcount, or what's happening there?","Mark V. Hurd","Yes, it is nothing more than the run rate that comes. So imagine as we talked over the several quarters, there is not a big bump sequentially per se as it is just the run rate of the hiring. As I've said before, we were quicker to hire in Europe, which is what really has helped us in Europe. While Europe was not fantastic for us in Q1, over the past several quarters they've gained a lot of share in Europe, and one of the reasons for that has been the fact that they've simply been in more deals. They've been in front of more customers. We were slower to ramp in the U.S., although to your point with your numbers, we have begun to, and that shows up in the run rate that turns into this year-over-year comp rate. And it is shown up by the fact that when you look at our U.S. numbers over the past couple of quarters, we are beginning to see some of that same effect that we saw in Europe.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mark, I'm wondering if you talk about -- you did have a better performance it seems like from a sales execution perspective in Q1. I'm wondering if you could talk about what changes you've made in the sales organization with executions in the fiscal '14, in the early months of that.","Mark V. Hurd","We really made no changes in fiscal '14. So as we said last year, we made changes over a year ago. And one of our objectives going into '14 was to make a minimal amount of changes. We -- before we went into 2014, we had all our territories deployed, our quotas deployed. We really looked to change almost 0 territories and keep the territories the same as they were the year before. We kept our specialization the same as the year before. So as a result, we wound up really ready to go in the very early part of the quarter. And I think we talked about this in the last conference call, but it was a big thing for us to have our quotas deployed and our territories defined. Everybody knew their boss very early in June, and you could see it had in the end some effect for us. So there really were not many changes in the sales force. And it's also shown up -- and frankly our attrition is down, which is helpful as well because we have performers. And when you have to have attrition, you have to change a territory when someone attrits and the fact that the attrition down is helpful to us in that respect as well.","Operator","And we'll now take our last question from Kash Rangan.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Mark and Safra, could you talk about -- it's been a couple of years since you finished up Taleo and RightNow, and I wonder if you could give us your thoughts on how you view the growth opportunities with these 2 product lines albeit they're niche-y one, but they are still important, if you get it. But also I think the one story that is not told is the vertical-specific application. There is a bit of a myopic focus on HR and CRM, which I completely get, but you guys have been historically very strong in vertical application. So I'm curious to get your thoughts on how -- do you see growth opportunities in verticals and how are they doing in general.","Mark V. Hurd","RightNow has done very well for us. When you look at the overall market position to the earlier question, today, we're really #1 in service automation. We haven't talked about Alcoa, but we're really #1 in marketing automation. So when you look at what's gone and when you look at the Web commerce space, our products like ATG and Decca, we're #1 in commerce server and the overall customer experience space. And when you line those up, we have a very powerful offering in that whole customer experience -- broader customer experience area. So right now, what's strong in the quarter, I would argue we grew in RightNow in the quarter against a very tough comp. Our toughest comp in RightNow in the quarter was Q1 and we had growth in Q1, and we were very encouraged by that. Particularly, Kash, the growth globally. We've had good global traction with RightNow. Taleo had a good quarter, very good growth in Taleo in the quarter, so we were excited about that as well. And they are both market leaders, leading recruiting app, and again, leading service automation app. Verticals, we told the story many times. I mean, we've had a tremendous run in retail. We really -- I hate to use the term rolled up the retail industry, but we're in the process of really going retailer to retailer to retailer with merchandising, planning, our point-of-sale capabilities and being able to really be the, we think, the leader in the retail applications marketplace. We made investments over the past couple of quarters in additional products and communications industry for our acquisitions at Tekelec and Acme Packet. And the collection now, we have a collection of billing assets, and those assets make us a leader now in the communications industry as well. We're doing the same thing in utilities, we're doing the same thing in banking, the same thing in health care. So it is a critical strategy for us. And the great news is when we win in these industries, all of Oracle wins. I mean, we win at the database layer, we win at the middleware layer, we win the hardware layer. So it's a very key strategy for us, and we've made investments in those areas, as that's both from an acquisition perspective and with more distribution as well.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Mark.

At this time, I would like to introduce Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations, Oracle. Please go ahead, sir.","Ken Bond","Thank you, [Amber]. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.","On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Larry Ellison; President and CFO, Safra Catz; and President, Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially effect those forward-looking statements.","These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today.","As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. And, we encourage you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risk factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.","And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra A. Catz","Thanks, Ken, good afternoon. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal 2013; then I\u2019ll review the guidance for Q1 and then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments. My remarks generally reflect constant dollar growth rate. This quarter, we saw record $4 billion in new software license and SaaS subscription, coming within my guidance range at 2% constant growth. In general, sales force execution improved significantly in most regions during the quarter. As with most of our peers we did see increased economic weakness in a few regions which had an effect on our final performance.","Geographically results were somewhat mixed with GAAP new license growing 4% in the Americas, up 5% EMEA, but down 7% in APAC. I just highlight places like Brazil, which pulled down our growth in the Americas and the number of countries in Asia, especially Australia is being particularly affected by economic slowdown beyond our expectation.","Europe\u2019s economy remains unchanged and we\u2019re actually pleased with our European performance. In addition, in Q4 we saw currency headwinds especially in Japan, Brazil and Australia were currencies weakened 5% to 8% against the dollars since our last earnings call and moves that were not anticipated in my Q4 guide.","Software support revenues were $4.4 billion, up 8% on this recurring part of our business. Support attach and renewal rates continue at their usual high level.","Hardware Systems revenue was better than expected at $849 million as our Engineered Systems had another spectacular quarter. We also saw growth in our T-Series SPARC servers, following a new product launch early in the quarter with some new M-Series now available, I think we are starting to see customers refresh their systems and we believe that we could have growth in total hardware as early as Q1.","Hardware gross margins were 51%, reflecting our strategy to focus only on high value systems and the return of hardware growth should actually help increase gross margins even more overtime.","Total revenue for the quarter was nearly $11 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.6 billion with operating margins expanding to 51% from 50% last year. Aside from the five quarters immediately following the Sun acquisition, non-GAAP operating margins have expanded year-over-year every quarter since November 2006 and we actually continue to see ample leverage in our business model.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23.8% and the GAAP tax rate was 21.1%. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.87 and would have been actually $0.01 higher, but for the negative impact of currency, up from $0.82 last year. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.80, up from $0.69 last year.","Operating cash flow increased to $14.2 billion over the last four quarters and free cash flow grew to $13.6 billion over the last four quarters. Both are record results. We now have $32.2 billion in cash and marketable securities.","Now for the full fiscal year and for the first time ever our new software sales were more than $10 billion growing 6% in constant currency together new software license and support and software support grew 7%, averaging 10% over the last five years. And our last major software acquisitions was more than five years ago.","While hardware and hardware support declined 14%, I think we may have just seen the last of annual hardware revenue declines, which will have positive implications for total revenues. Even with the declines in hardware revenues, total revenues for the year grew 2% to more than $37 billion.","Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was an all time high of 47%. Earnings per share was $2.68 growing 11% in FY 2013. Since we first shared our goal of growing non-GAAP EPS 20% overtime back in 2005. We've averaged nearly 19% growth for both EPS and free cash flow over the last eight years even though the world went through massive economic crisis.","In Q4, we purchased nearly 85 million shares for a total of $2.8 billion and for the full year repurchased nearly 350 million shares for total of $11 billion. So, as you saw in our release today we announced we are restarting our quarterly dividend earlier than previously planned and with a 100% increase to our quarterly dividend or $0.12 per share. This will commence with a record date of July 12 and the payout date of August 2.","The Board also authorized the repurchase of an additional $12 billion of common stock under our existing share repurchase program in future quarters. Between dividend and buyback, this year we returned more than $12.4 billion or more than 90% of our free cash flow to our shareholders.","Today we also announced that we\u2019ve applied to list our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under our current symbol ORCL and subject to approval by the NYSE we expect our common stock will begin trading on the NYSE on July 15. Now until the transfer is completed Oracle will continue to trade on the NASDAQ under our current symbol.","Now moving to guidance; I will say in advance that I continue to follow the news of the economy and the results of nearly every one of our competitors, so I have tried to keep that in mind in my guidance. And since I don't know what the exchange rates will be at quarter end, I\u2019m going to give guidance in constant currency. Now at current rate currency will reduce growth rate by about 1% and general growth rates, license and revenue and EPS by about $0.02 that\u2019s what it looks like right now.","So with guidance, new software license and cloud subscription revenue is expected to range from 0 to 8% in constant currency in non-GAAP and 1% to 9% in GAAP. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from a negative 6% to positive 2% in constant currency and as a result total revenue growth on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 6% in constant dollars.","Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.59 in constant dollar. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.42 and $0.45 in constant dollar. This guidance assumes GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 24% of course and it may end up being different.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark for his comments.","Mark Hurd","Thanks, Safra. Just today I thought I\u2019ll be brief and talk a little bit about our Cloud business and give you some facts. Our Cloud now runs well over $1 billion run rate and it is bigger than both Workday and SAP combined in the cloud. We are clearly the second largest provider in the SaaS market with more than 130 Fusion customers that are live in production today. In Q4 alone we added 500 new SaaS customers, 300 of those in HCM alone.","Not only are we bigger than Workday and HCM but we are growing faster than Workday. Recently we claimed that is 50 new customers in HCM and ERP. We added more than 50 in HCM alone and with more than 80 new Fusion SaaS customers we have great SaaS HCM wins at British Telecom, BMC Software, Siemens, Credit Agricole, Yahoo! and Intuit.","In customer experience, we added 200 customers, with great cloud wins at eBay, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Trimble Navigation, Dow Corning, Sprint Nextel, Capital One, US Foods, Acer, Tesco and Paccar. I just read you that list just you get an idea of the quality and the brand names that are committing to our technology. So our success in the cloud is significant and undeniable.","Let me share a few facts about how we run our cloud. The cloud runs on our engineered systems. We have nearly 13,000 VM, 70 petabytes of storage in seven countries, more than 7.6 million users and 16.5 million or billion transactions per day.","Let me switch to our pipeline. It\u2019s healthy. Our sales organization is already geared to outperform our competitors. I want to say this again, our attrition rates are down. They have declined and by June 7, that\u2019s roughly two weeks ago, we had 90% of our territory assignments and code is done with sales plans accepted, that is an absolute record for Oracle.","Now next week I want you to stay tuned, as we\u2019re going to make a series of announcements regarding our success in the cloud and the partnerships we\u2019re forming to drive our cloud business forward.","With that I\u2019m going to turn it over to Larry, so that he can touch on some of our exciting developments.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Thank you, Mark. In Engineered Systems we had a very strong quarter. Revenue was up approximately 50% as we took considerable market share from our primary competitor IBM P-Series which was down 32% in their most recent quarter. All our Exa products, Exadata, Exalogic, Exalytics and the Big Data Appliance and the Oracle Database Appliance, all had their best ever quarters.","In bookings, we sold over 1200 engineering systems in Q4 including more than 600 Exadata\u2019s. Exalogic was up more than 50% sequentially and we sold more than 100 units of Exalytics in the quarter. For the year, we sold over 3000 Engineered Systems more than all the previous years combined. Tesco, Fidelity, Siemens, McGraw-Hill, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Saudi Telecom, to name just a few of the companies that bought Engineered Systems this past quarter.","Some of the SAPs largest customer\u2019s, giant German industrial companies bought Exadata, not HANA to run their SAP applications. We virtually never see HANA in the market and SAP\u2019s HANA numbers simply don\u2019t add up.","A recent analyst report pointed out that if you believe the HANA sales growth numbers and SAP\u2019s most recent quarterly report, then SAP\u2019s application business must have declined 10%. You decide, either HANA is doing and SAP\u2019s application business is in steep decline or HANA is not doing so well, but SAP\u2019s application business is okay. You can\u2019t have it both ways. We don\u2019t think SAP\u2019s HANA can ever successfully compete with Oracle\u2019s Exadata and our other engineered systems in the high performance database market.","Engineered systems are now over one-third of Oracle\u2019s hardware revenue. Our SPARC server line is now completely refreshed. Our T5 and M5 servers feature the fastest microprocessor in the world, faster than Intel and faster than IBM P7+ on numerous industry standard benchmarks.","With the continued rapid growth of our now much larger engineered systems business, both our new high performance SPARC T5 and M5 server, we just might see overall hardware growth this Q1, and we will see overall hardware growth for the full fiscal year.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Larry. [Amber] we can now move to the Q&A portion of the call please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, thank you. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go first to Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thank you very much. Good to see the hardware product and the Fusion referenced pretty do well. But, on the software side, typically Oracle has had very strong May quarter finishes, we\u2019ve always called it the magic of May quarter. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a little bit more color Safra, Mark and Larry. And if you saw any slippage that was specific to more sort of the applications business, large ticket items, economically more sensitive. If these deals are put on hold and how is the linearity shaping up in June? As you exited the quarter, did you feel little bit better, but how that trends were getting better, because we\u2019ve been caring about software companies facing difficulties in the month of March and April. I\u2019m just curious, how thinks shaped up and how you exited the quarter? Sorry for the bunch of questions, but I really appreciate the color. Thank you.","Safra A. Catz","I don\u2019t know which one of us should start. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we saw some weakness in specific regions, especially Asia-Pacific, especially parts of Latin America that were that came up right at the end on us and that was extremely disappointing for us because May is usually our very, very big and important month and it\u2019s a big quarter and it\u2019s sort of lased out where it did. We\u2019ve had a pretty good start actually in the other regions, but it\u2019s too soon to tell on and that\u2019s why my guidance is where it is.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Good. Let me add. It was not a specific product. I mean, when we saw weakness, we saw weakness in database middleware applications in all of our software lines. So it was clearly an economic issue not a product competitive issue. The products performed kind of as we expected, it\u2019s just that they didn\u2019t reach the ceiling, we\u2019ve got where we\u2019re going to reach in the quarter.","Mark Hurd","Now, I\u2019ll just add a little bit of color to casual. I think we actually did pretty well in Europe. We actually felt quite good considering all you read, you talk about, what you read about software companies, you read a lot about the tech sector in Europe and frankly as we talked before the Salesforce what we\u2019ve done there has been material and its helpful for us. We banked on conversion rates being down in Europe and frankly they weren\u2019t down as much as we thought. We executed quite well.","We did fine in the U.S. and the surplus points really was for us Brazil and parts of Asia where we saw the rest of he everything, sort of behaved the way we expected over the course of the year with the exception of the quarter. There are few section of engineered systems to be good, which was better than we expected, going in which led to the hardware performance that we described.","On a number of transactions basis, some of it to Larry\u2019s point, really had to do with the transactions just getting a bit skinnier. If you looked at number of transactions, you wouldn't see that bigger delta, a lot of it just had to do with the average size per transaction which again indicates to us certainly a lot of economic issue out there.","Kash Rangan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you. And Safra it does look like you feel little bit better based on the guidance which is a lot better than we would have expected for the upcoming August licenses especially.","Safra A. Catz","Yes, well we thought things pushed off. I see them closing, but I do have to keep an eye on what my competitors are reporting and what's going on. So it\u2019s sort of all in there together and we feel good with where we are guiding.","Kash Rangan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great.","Operator","And we will go next to Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill \u2013 UBS Equities","Thanks, good afternoon. Mark, you are adding tremendous sales capacity and you mentioned the unforced attrition is down. So why do you think you\u2019re not seeing the resulting fall through in license results? I certainly the comments you made about the Asia Pacific, but it is a small percent of your overall revenue, and maybe if you could just expand on the ASP in Q3. I think you disclosed that that was down high teens as it relates to deals over $3 million. It seems like the larger deals you\u2019re still seeing pressure. If you could just tell a little more color would be helpful.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Yeah, let me just jump in front of Mark and give you kind of our view. We\u2019ve been adding a lot of sales people in the cloud. So a lot of our additions, in Europe and in North America is around our cloud offerings, which we\u2019re seeing great growth. So we think as part of the transition the cloud, the bulk of the sales that are not in our attrition traditional on-premises database business or on-premises application business, the bulk of that have been in our Cloud businesses and we\u2019ll continue to add. We\u2019ve hired about 500 sales people and sales consultants directly out of college this year and virtually all of them will go to our Cloud businesses and about 10% will go to our Linux business, which is becoming very, very competitive with Red Hat, but it\u2019s the new businesses that we\u2019re in, that is absorbing most, not all, but most of our sales app.","Mark Hurd","Yeah. So I think you got Brent, everything Larry said and then add to it that where we have that because we are still even with that add in the cloud net off and our traditional license area. So although it\u2019s not all of what we\u2019ve added to Larry\u2019s points. But we have seen the benefits. I\u2019ll tell you exactly. In Europe, we have seen bigger pipelines and we\u2019ve seen the economic pressure on the convergence rate and that growth you see in Europe is directly related to the fact that we\u2019ve added our sales force. So make no mistake about it, the growth in our pipeline that you see in Latin America, when you see some of these issues in Brazil, this is what happens when you see an economic environment like this. You see the pipe go up, you see conversion go down. If you\u2019re going to gain share you\u2019re going to have to be in more deals. So we\u2019re in more deals. Let me give you a second point.","Historically when these economies turn you do not have enough time to rehire your distribution capability to take advantage of the change in the economy. If that pipe is not sitting there when markets get better you lose out on that expansion. So this is actually, it\u2019s counterintuitive, I know, this is the right time to be in a position with a broader distribution capability. I\u2019ll add to it. We\u2019ve been very mindful of our expenses while we\u2019ve done it. So when you look at our expense structure, we have taken money from other places and funded the majority of the sales force expansion.","Now to Larry\u2019s point, some of this is not going into full and full ARR, annual recurring revenue, which we\u2019re seeing the strong growth, which will pay us dividend as you go out over the next couple of years.","Brent Thill \u2013 UBS Equities","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll next go to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason A. Maynard \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. I have two questions. First, Mark, can we drill down a little bit more into Asia Pacific, because if you look at the different regions on a constant currency basis, U.S. and EMEA both actually performed maybe about as expected. But it\u2019s actually when you dive into APAC, the last two quarters that have really fell off the close after a strong start of the year. So I\u2019d love to get a little bit more color, maybe by Australia and some of the different countries in there which you\u2019re seeing. And then the second question for Larry is just, as you look out the next four quarters separately, the comment about the hardware business turning potentially positive in Q1. What are some of the assumptions that you guys see by product within Engineered Systems and the Smart product lines that gets you to that level of actually showing year-over-year hardware product revenue growth? Thanks","Lawrence J. Ellison","Okay, most important question, I\u2019ll tackle the first part. I think you\u2019re right by the way and way you described the quarter for us. We saw roughly what we expected in Europe, in fact a little bit better than what we expected and roughly what we expected in the Americas. Asia as you know, there is no real Asia for say. It\u2019s a little bit behavior by countries. We continue to see pressure in China as you read across most of the other tech companies described we saw that. And we have the effected Safra mentioned in Australia. That is both some weakness in the Australian market which you will also see as a read through in their economy, but frankly going up against the big prior year. So we had a prior year in Australia and we have the economic issues that you saw. Those are the two markets, we did fine in Korea and fine in India overall.","Mark Hurd","On the harbor side of the question. It\u2019s really very, very simple. We had a number of businesses and those other Sun business, the commodity x86 business, that we have exited and we\u2019re pretty much out at. Reselling other people storage systems like Hitachi and LSI Logic, which were pretty much out at. And so those declining businesses have finished declining. We think the businesses that remain, we got two big businesses that remain, one is the SPARC server business which is now refreshed. And we think can grow, though that is not in our assumption for growth.","Our only assumption for growth is that our engineer systems business which has consistently grown and grew very rapidly this quarter. We will continue to grow and that alone will drive the overall hardware business into growth. If we recovered with our new SPARC line, if that recovers and also shows just a little bit of growth. The growth in hardware will be spectacular.","Ken Bond","Next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather A. Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if Larry, you could help us frame how the upcoming release 12B could differ from past cycles in terms of license growth rates. And I guess a follow on to that as you\u2019re related to portable database containers. I\u2019m just wondering if you could share with us whether or not that was part of people, maintenance contracts or whether that will be a paid option. Thank you.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Okay. The 12c is multi-tenant database, 12c stands for the cloud, it\u2019s the first time a database converts multi-tenancy to the applications that run on the database, because you know, the cloud business started about 15 years ago with a little company called NetSuite. And then there came Dell course and many others and what they have to do was to build multi-tenancy into the application. They wanted to run a lot of customers\u2019 data on a small number of server and do that economically. They had to build the multi-tenant capability directly into their application, which has certain problem. It has security problems that means that your standard report letters won\u2019t work, a lot of standard tools just won\u2019t work because of this multi-tenancy application architecture.","The next kind of phase of multi-tenancy was Virtual Machine, VMs became very, very popular way of sharing a hardware, sharing server, but unfortunately that has significant overhead, much more overhead than kind of the NetSuite, Salesforce.com, way of doing an application. We think the right to convert a multi-tenancy on applications and keep security working and use the hardware very, very efficiently, is to put multi-tenancy at the database layer and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done with 12c. It is a separately priced option.","Next week, we will be announcing technology partnerships with the most important \u2013the largest and most important SaaS companies and infrastructure companies in the cloud. And they will be using our technology, committing to our technology for years to come. That\u2019s how important we are doing 12c. We think 12c will be the foundation of a modern cloud where you get multi-tenant applications with a high degree of security and a high degree of efficiency, you at least have to sacrifice one for the other.","Again, I would call them a startling series of announcement with companies like Saleforce.com, NetSuite, Microsoft all that happen next week will give you the details. These partnerships in the cloud I think will reshape the cloud and reshape the perception of Oracle Technology in the cloud. 12c in other words is the most important technology we\u2019ve ever developed for this new generation of cloud security.","Unidentified Company Representative","May be I\u2019ll just add something a little more mundane, and that is that our database options business was really strong in the quarter. I mean, when you look at GoldenGate security compression, very strong performance for us in the quarter and suddenly when you see some of the people that have jumped on these capabilities, database enterprise manager\u2019s strong growth in the quarter, our database options business in the quarter very, very strong.","Ken Bond","Okay, great. Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","We will go next to with Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities.","Richard Sherlund \u2013 Nomura Securities","Thanks. Larry, just two questions for you to kind of update us on a couple of things. First, you talked that Oracle was about some cloud services, I know you\u2019ve got private, public, hybrid cloud, you articulate, want to get updates on what\u2019s happening there?","And second in terms of in-memory capabilities just reading the trade, there has been a lot of speculation that you\u2019re going to deliver some kind of in-memory capabilities that are compatible with the Oracle Database, if you could share any thoughts with us on that?","Lawrence J. Ellison","Okay, happy to. Oracle participates at all three layers of Cloud. We are really kind of a unique Cloud company. We\u2019re, as Mark pointed, the second largest SaaS provider in the world. We added 500 new SaaS customers alone, 500 new logos at the SaaS layer this past quarter. We actually had more and let it be clear, not to lay it out, because we have more new Fusion CRM, I will be very clear. Take out two layers don\u2019t count it, just look at our Fusion HCM, look at our Fusion HCM customers. We added more new Fusion core HCM customer last quarter than Workday added their AHCM plus ERP customers, that\u2019s a Fusion, not the layout.","We\u2019re growing very fast in the Cloud and especially the HCM Cloud, especially Fusion HCM and as Mark pointed out, we are larger in SaaS than anyone, about Salesforce.com. We are larger than Workday and SAP combined.","Richard Sherlund \u2013 Nomura Securities","Okay.","Lawrence J. Ellison","But that\u2019s not the only layer we compete in SaaS. We compete at the platform layer and if you kind of look at Oracle historically, that\u2019s where you would expect us to be stronger. These are our two brands in SaaS; the Oracle Database and Java. Those are the two most important platforms on the face of the earth with building applications. The both products are dominant. There are more than 9 million Java developers.","On our platform business, our cloud platform business, we have over 5,000 customers in our cloud. Mark mentioned our cloud is over 6,000 servers, 12,000 VMs, almost 70 terabytes of storage in 11 locations around the world or almost 8 million users per day and over 16 billion transactions per day. Mark mentioned all those numbers.","But again we have over 34, we announced our platform service last April and now we have now over 3,500 or over 3,400 customers in the Oracle Database Cloud and another 1,700 in the Java Cloud and that\u2019s just the beginning.","We think our PaaS business is one of our huge, huge competitive advantages where you tend to think that the big cloud players are either in SaaS, like Salesforce.com or in infrastructure like Amazon. You really don\u2019t think of a real strong PaaS player, well, that\u2019s where we think we have a huge advantage and we think that approves to our big SaaS customers, because when you buy a SaaS product, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not going to build other little things yourselves in the cloud to go along with the SaaS products you buy. And with Salesforce.com, they are the market leader and a big respect for what Marc Benioff has achieved over there, I think he\u2019s done a good job, but they started a long time ago, and they have a platform called Force.com, which is not based on industry standards.","So when you make additions to Salesforce.com, you lie in Salesforce\u2019s proprietary on platform. When you make additions to our SaaS applications, you use the Oracle database and Java; the industry standards. So we think customers are going to look at the entire cloud and assess the quality of the application, SaaS, the quality of the platform and we don\u2019t think any of the big cloud players can compete with us in the platform there. And, of course, the quality of the infrastructure, which Mark mentioned earlier, which is our engineered systems, which, again, we think gives us a big competitive advantage.","So the combination of 12c for the cloud, which is going to be, which we think will be adopted by most of the big cloud player as well as our corporate customer as they build cloud inside their firewall. It\u2019s huge and we think the advantage that another advantage that we offer is the clouds that our customers are going to run internally made up of Oracle and Java is the same cloud that we offer in our public cloud. So they can build applications and move them back and forth. They can build an application in Oracle and Java on our public cloud and move it back to their private cloud. They can take an application that runs in their private cloud and move it to the public cloud. They can do test and development in the public cloud and run it in their private cloud. Because our cloud is based on industry standards, our platform is based on industry standards. We\u2019re the only company that\u2019s doing that, very optimistic about our ability, it could be in the cloud.","Again, I said earlier, going through this transition, where we moved a lot of our new sales guys again, not all, a lot of our new sales guys on the cloud, so we\u2019re moving aggressively with sales not only applications, but our database and Java and our infrastructure in the cloud. We\u2019re investing a lot in engineering, we\u2019re investing a lot in sales because we think the opportunity is gigantic and we\u2019re well positioned and with a key new enabling technology called Oracle 12c database.","Ken Bond","Operator next call please, question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter H. Pritchard \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Hi, Safra, I\u2019m wondering if you could we heard a lot about the Cloud here in SaaS. And, I\u2019m wondering if you could help us understand both near-term and longer-term the impact of that on license revenue, a) how they maybe depressing, what we\u2019re seeing on that it?","Safra A. Catz","Well, at this point, the reality is that most of our customers are application customers that are taking some Cloud offerings are doing it as a complementary offering, and to the extent to what they\u2019ve already got onsite. So, it\u2019s not necessarily now if all of our application customers overnight all gosh, I don\u2019t know 10,000 of them, overnight switched to SaaS, then that might have an effect, but we have so many customers and the dynamics are such that many are adding on and some are adding on on-premise, some are adding on cloud and some of them are replacing on-premise with cloud. We\u2019ve such a large base that net, net we have growth. So that\u2019s the dynamic right now, in the event that everyone tomorrow switch over, well that would have a different affect, but that\u2019s not likely to happen.","Mark Hurd","Let me add my comment which is, we think when someone chooses an Oracle application in the Cloud versus an Oracle application on-premise. We make more money overtime. Now, the order that revenue comes in is a little bit different, because we take it ratably rather than a big chunk upfront. But, we think when someone becomes a cloud customer that is an economically more valuable customer to us overtime than when someone buys our software program. So, we think over a reasonable term we benefit tremendously from the movement to the cloud.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Yes add to it Walter there is other dynamics of player because of the way our software is architected we can sell by module. So in many ways it opens up brand new markets to us. We can go sell to an SAP customer, a module of HCM, I reckon by recruiting too much, they don\u2019t have to \u2018rip and replace\u2019. Somebody like a Workday actually has still a lot of \u2018rip and replace\u2019 than we would. We can go in supplement many of our application users today with their core on-premise app with new modules of our SaaS Fusion application. So actually in some ways, long run we\u2019 re going to have to go through the ARR phase where we start building up our ARR as we go that opens up new markets that we haven\u2019t had available to us before.","Walter H. Pritchard \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Thank you.","Ken Bond","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Philip A. Winslow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Hi thanks guys. Just got two questions actually, first back on the hardware side obviously we talk a lot about engineered systems, but wondering, if you gave us an update on the M5 and T5. I know it\u2019s early, but just what are you hearing from customers about those two new processors and second servers. And then kind of flipping gears to the software front, Mark and two of us have talked about your customer experience management solutions from CRM to marketing, to commerce, just how is that sort of set of products doing then with some of the changes competitively out there with sales was finding that target, hybrids going to SAP, just how do you think your product line is set up there, thanks.","Mark Hurd","Phil, I\u2019ll start with the first part of your question which was hardware, the T-Series is growing nicely and again I mentioned that's not part of our assumption for growth for hardware the entire year, that's heavily weighted to engineered systems, Exadata, SPARC SuperCluster, et cetera. But T is growing nicely and there is huge interest in our M-series machine. The interesting thing about the M5, post the T5, the M5 has 32 terabytes of DRAM. It is designed to be an in-memory machine. We will now, at the end of the year that, Oracle 12 1C. 12 1C is an in-memory database and it is designed to work exceedingly well with our M-Series machines again, which have more memory by the way than any other computer on the planet earth.","It\u2019s an SMP machine with 32 sockets and 32 terabytes of DRAM and we have designed that machine in concert with the next version of our database, which comes out at the end of the year, which is a vertical columnar compressed high speed in-memory vertical database and we think one of the reasons I was very confident that SAP HANA could never compete with Oracle over the long-term is because of 12 1C. And again we combine that software technology with our latest M-Series large scale in-memory Machine and I think, by the way that machine is not very expensive.","Philip A. Winslow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Yeah. And your T5 has taken off faster than T4?","Lawrence J. Ellison","T4, we talked about the growth we\u2019ve seen in T4 where we\u2019ve seen the reduction in Million, which is fundamentally what\u2019s happened to the SPARC line. The T5, so that\u2019s early days still. So we are going to have see how it\u2019ll unfold, but I think very encouraging from the numbers we saw both in the quarter in orders and in the pipeline and there is a large installed base of SPARC that\u2019s out there for us to go, sell into particular on the high end.","To your question, I think your question was on ATG and Endeca software, which is basically the foundation of our Commerce Server and what we\u2019ll call our customer experience very strong numbers. We just don\u2019t lose deals. So at the end of the day when you get into that space and you\u2019ve seen it particularly too in the retail industry, many of the big retailers that are focusing on how to connect to their customer, how to engage to the customer and how they cross-sell and up-sell to that customer, that\u2019s at the core fabric of what they deploy.","We expect to see that same sort of behavior in the telecommunications industry, financial services industry and we love our position. And we don\u2019t believe any effect of our competitors\u2019 position based on SAP\u2019s acquisition or what Salesforce has done. Remember one more time, the leader in marketing automation software is Oracle; Eloqua is the leader. So it is not anybody else. And we\u2019ve got a head start and we did very well, I didn\u2019t mention it in my comments. Eloqua did very well in the quarter in terms of its ARR. So we like our aggregate hand, we like our position with RightNow on the service side, we like our position on the commerce side with ATG, we like our position on the marketing side with Eloqua. So we feel good about where we sit.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Yeah, let me just kind of summarize what Mark said, where you think the Salesforce.com is the company that has a very strong foothold in companies that sell B2B. We think we have an equally strong foothold in companies that sell B2C. So while we think we\u2019re going to be aggressively compete with Salesforce where we think we have huge competitive advantage, where our number one competitor turns out to be IBM in that space, we just don\u2019t lose deals to IBM in eCommerce.","Unidentified Company Representative","Next question please?","Operator","We\u2019ll take our final question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you guys for fitting me in. Maybe a last one for Safra. In terms of the guidance into Q1, can you give us a little bit of color in terms of sort of the conservatism you used in setting that guide, maybe talk a little of that sort of close rate assumptions and how you\u2019re thinking about, how you thought about that guide?","Safra A. Catz","Yeah, well, as I said, first of all, I get, as you know, I get a roll up from the field. And I look at the different close rates that we\u2019ve had historically and the numbers that we\u2019re using right now assume a slightly lower close rate than we have historically and takes into account sort of the difference we\u2019ve been experiencing especially this quarter and in Q3. I have to know what\u2019s going on with our competitors and since even deals that didn\u2019t close this quarter, they were not lost to competitors, they were either pushed off or what also showed up in close rates or they became smaller by certain percentage, and so that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve applied.","So, I\u2019m not going to quantify it for you, but I\u2019ve assumed a few points lower than would be typical for a Q1 especially since number of the Q4 deals especially have closed already. So I just had to pretty much take into account what we\u2019ve been seeing for the past couple of quarters and apply that to the pipeline.","Keith Weiss \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent, very helpful.","Safra A. Catz","Okay.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ken Bond for any additional or closing remarks.","Ken Bond","Thank you operator. That does conclude our call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to introduce Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations, Oracle. Please go ahead, sir.","Ken Bond","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2012 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.","On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Larry Ellison; President and CFO, Safra Catz; and President, Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements.","These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra?","Safra A. Catz","Hi. Thanks, Ken, and thank you, all, for joining us on such short notice. As you can see, we delivered a really strong quarter to finish the year in the face of sort of a wild Europe global economy month-close new cycle. Since we were actually ready and in an effort to permit us to speak more freely, we thought you wouldn't mind if we released today instead.","I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 in fiscal 2012. I'll then review guidance for Q1, and then turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments.","With the strengthening U.S. dollar, the currency headwind for new software license was 5%, which, many of you remember, is 2 percentage points higher than our guidance. Total revenue saw similar effect as the currency headwind was higher than expected. As a result, my remarks hereafter reflect constant dollar growth rates unless I tell you otherwise.","For the full fiscal year, we delivered 9% new license growth in constant dollars following, of course, a spectacular year last year at 19%. Our software business surpassed IBM's last year and is now growing at more than double the rate of IBM over the last 5 years. We delivered 11% EPS growth for this fiscal year after reporting 33% last year, and we still averaged nearly 20% growth over the last 5 years. Obviously, we couldn't be happier with our Q4 results.","The new software license revenue for the quarter was at the high end of my guidance, to a record $4 billion, up 12%. We\u2019re especially pleased as this was the third consecutive year that we've reported double-digit growth for the fourth quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our new license growth as reported over the last 5 years is nearly double that of SAP.","We continue to see broad-based geographic and product momentum as technology new license revenues were $2.7 billion, up 5% following double-digit growth in each of the prior 2 -- last 2 years. Applications had a fantastic quarter, growing to $1.3 billion, up 27%, this on 16% growth last year. All the regions, including EMEA, reported double-digit growth in applications, with North America reporting an amazing 38% growth. Geographically, the quarter was strong and balanced, with new license growing 16% in the Americas, 13% in APAC and 2% in EMEA. And again, the quarter was not dependent on any large deals.","Software license update and product support revenues were $4.2 billion, up 8% on this highly profitable and recurring part of our business. Hardware system revenue was $977 million for the quarter, which was above our guidance. Engineered systems business is now running at an annual rate of over $1 billion or so, and the growth rate of this business has been nothing short of amazing.","Hardware gross margins were 51% for the quarter on lower volume than we had last year. Total revenue for the quarter was $11 billion, up 5% from last year. In addition to our strong top line performance, we're pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of $5.5 billion, which was 10% higher than last year as operating margins expanded to 50% from 48% last year. And the full year operating margin was at 46.2% as we continue to see ample leverage in our business model. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%.","Okay. Sorry, I am not in my regular position, so I'm just trying to put together what I've got here. So let me move on to guidance. So assuming -- oh, okay. Non-GAAP -- sorry, not ready to go there. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.82 above our forecast, even after considering the favorable tax rate. That we\u2019re able to put these top line and bottom line results given our size once again demonstrates the strength of our diversified portfolio of enterprise products, the breadth of loyalty of our huge customer base and the strength of our operating model.","The fact remains that we have products in the data center, in the cloud and everywhere that customers want to buy. We now have $30.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. And operating cash flow increased to a record $13.7 billion for the year, while free cash flow increased to 3.1 -- excuse me, $13.1 billion for the year, up 22% from last year. Over the last 5 years, our free cash flow has grown at an average of 20%, further demonstrating the strength of the business model.","As we've always said, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 87.6 million shares for a total of $2.5 billion for the full year. We repurchased more than 207 million shares for a total of nearly $6 billion. The record share repurchases of this year will nearly match of those of the last 3 years combined. As you saw in our release, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $10 billion of common stock under our existing share repurchase program in future quarters. The board again declared a dividend of $0.06.","I'm going to move to the guidance. I will say in advance, obviously, I do read the same newspapers you all do and do keep up with the news of the economy, et cetera, and so I have tried to keep that in mind in my guidance regardless of our achievements in the fourth quarter. So assuming exchange rates remain where they are at current levels, which right now is a negative 5% currency impact on license growth rate and on total revenue growth rate, our guidance for Q1 is as follows. New software license revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range, these are in constant dollars, 5% to 15% in constant currency or 10 -- 0% to 10% on current rates. On a GAAP basis, we expect new software license growth range to be anywhere from 4% to 14% in constant currency and negative 1% to positive 9% under current rates. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from negative 12% to negative 2% in constant currency and negative 17% to negative 7% in current rates, and that doesn't include the hardware support revenue.","Total revenue growth on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 6% in constant currency and negative 2% to positive 1% in current rate. The non-GAAP EPS is expected to be anywhere from $0.54 to $0.58 in constant currency or $0.51 to $0.55 at current rate, up from $0.48 last year. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.40 to $0.44 in constant currency and $0.37 to $0.41 at current rate. This guidance assumes a GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. Of course, it may end up being different.","With that, I will turn it over to Mark for his comments.","Mark V. Hurd","Thanks, Safra. I'll just make a couple comments and turn it over to Larry. We're lining up to drive even more growth. We've lined up our North American organization to compete with our new application competitors. And just to be clear, we're not lining up our sales force. They are already lined up.","In Q4, we integrated Taleo and RightNow into North America and have record bookings. In Q4, we lined up territories to be ready on June 1. This is the earliest I'm aware of that we've ever had territories and comp plans aligned. Everyone has a boss, a territory and a comp plan. We've asked Joanne Olsen, who runs cloud services, to run our North American applications business. Many of you know Joanne. She is one of our most capable executives. All in order to get prepared to compete and drive more focus and more growth.","There are no changes toward tech or our hardware sales forces. No changes in any other geographies. We will continue to specialize our sales force against our secular competitors to take advantage of what we believe are significant growth opportunities. We added 500 sales and presales people in the fourth quarter. This makes a net increase of 3,300 people this year. Deal and sales attrition are down materially over the past couple of years. Better news, the attrition amongst our top performers is down materially as well.","We have the best product lineup in the industry, a great pipeline and sales resources to drive even more organic growth. This year, we added sales resource while managing our expenses. We further specialized our sales force. We also worked to ready the team earlier than ever before to execute for the upcoming year.","In closing, it was not only a strong numerical quarter in licenses, engineered systems and fast signings. We did the things that you won't see in the numbers to prepare for future growth.","With that, I'm going to turn it over to Larry.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Thank you, Mark. Well, Safra walked you through the numbers. And to me, the 12% constant dollar growth for new software licenses really stands out. We sold $4 billion in software for the first time ever, and this growth comes off double-digit comparisons over the last 2 years.","Software had a fantastic quarter on multiple fronts, including applications growth of 27% in constant dollars. The Oracle Cloud is now open for business. And with the addition of RightNow and Taleo, we're already the world's second largest SaaS company, with the bookings approaching $1 billion run rate.","Human Capital Management had a great quarter, with SaaS wins over Workday at UBS, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Vivendi. CRM also had a great quarter, with SaaS wins at Green Mountain Coffee, Swiss Light and Graco.","Our industry-focused businesses grew faster than our other software sales this quarter, with strength in health care, retail and financial services. Over the last 5 years, our GBUs have grown approximately 4x faster than our other software businesses. By helping customers automate their strategic industry-specific processes, we position Oracle to sell the customer our entire stack of integrated technology.","Hardware. Another great quarter for engineered systems. We came very close to booking as much business this quarter as we did for all of last year for engineered systems. Q4 bookings were $274 million. In FY '11, bookings were $300 million for engineered systems, very exciting.","Both Exadata and Exalogic saw triple-digit bookings growth, with great wins at PayPal, Deutsche Bank, Telefonica, Facebook and at SAP's largest oil and gas customer in Europe. Exalogic continues to ramp faster than Exadata. And Exalytics, our in-memory analytics competitor to SAP's HANA, is ramping faster than Exalogic. In Exalytics' second quarter since the product was released, unit bookings are more than double Exalogic and 10x those of Exadata in their second quarters, respectively. Exalytics may very well be the strongest engineered system value proposition Oracle has yet released, and we're not seeing much competition from HANA.","We have great Exalytics wins at Toshiba, Sodexo and Thomson Reuters, who also bought Exadata, Exalogic and Big Data Appliance systems during the quarter. While we exceeded our hardware forecast this quarter, our focus remains at returning the overall hardware business to growth in FY '13.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Ken.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Larry. Operator, we can begin the Q&A portion of the call, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'd love to get a little bit more color on this transformation into selling Exa systems. And to get your perspective in terms of how ready, willing is the customer for sort of mainstream adoption and how much more work do you have to do in terms of getting all the products lined up in terms of making that, if you will, that -- called a mainstream type of push so we can see Exa becoming maybe an even greater percentage of the hardware business?","Mark V. Hurd","Okay, Jason. I'll start, then turn it over to Larry for a couple of comments. As Larry stated, our revenue in engineered systems more than doubled in dollars year-over-year. And that's with the effect of currency. So we had material growth in engineered systems over the course of the year. And I think what you saw in Q4 -- what we saw in Q4 was some pretty material movements in terms of existing customers buying many more. And these are brand names, Jason. Brand names buying now instead of 2 or 3, buying 10 and 20 to the point that it became as big a number as Larry described, where, in the quarter, we frankly almost booked as much as we sold all of FY '11. So I think it's just exactly what you would expect. It's blocking and tackling for us, getting customers to try the technology. It's a disruption to their normal path of business. Remember, all of our Exa solutions combined servers and Exadata combines storage as well as software. And I think the ramp you're seeing is superb, and I think you should expect to see it again in 2013. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Yes. Well, again, we expect our Exa system business to approximately double in the current year. And the systems, while they're very, very fast right now, they're getting even faster as we adopt Intel's latest chips, the latest InfiniBand technology, the latest in large Flash memory systems. So we're riding that technology curve and improving our Exa systems at a much faster rate than, let's say, IBM is improving its Power Systems. So while we're faster than IBM Power now, that advantage is going to grow over the coming year and in coming years. This creates 2 interesting opportunities. One is for us to become the #1 player in high-end systems. Again, we expect to exit this current year selling about the same unit volume in the Exa line as IBM sells in their Power line. And we think at a somewhat higher unit price. So we think we're going to come very close at moving to the #1 position in high-end systems. That is not the endgame here. The most interesting part of Exa is not that we just deliver the highest performance of any computer out there. It's that our cost performance is so attractive. Remember, Exa is build out of commodity x86 machines or Xeon server parts. Therefore, we have the ability to not only achieve very high peak performance, but also achieve industry-leading cost performance. So we think we actually can eat into the commodity business, as well as the high-end server business. So we think Exa applies not just to high-end computing, but up and down the line, which gives us incredible growth potential going forward.","Mark V. Hurd","Jason, just to -- when Larry is talking about 2x, we are forecasting a big 2013. Again, a doubling  effect of engineered systems again. And so listen, you could feel the momentum. We can certainly see it in our pipeline, and we can see it in our results. And that Q4 was extremely strong for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I had a question following up on Jason's about the Exa product line. This seems to be the first quarter in a while where you guys have been able to really upside, surprise and do the high end of the range on the hardware side. And I'm just wondering specifically what -- even listening to your comments, what specifically changed this quarter? Is it some of the new Exa products ramping? Is it the sales force more comfortable? And also, kind of do you guys feel now that you have enough history where you're comfortable with the guidance forecast given, I think, it was probably a little bit harder business to forecast given you didn't have the history, Safra, that you did with the license business? So I'm just wondering if you could share some thoughts around that.","Lawrence J. Ellison","I'd like the comment. This is Larry. It's really a very, very simple answer. We had a large commodity hardware business that was getting smaller a year ago and a small Exa business that was getting larger. Now we have a small commodity business getting smaller and a larger, much larger Exa business getting larger. So as we double the Exa business off a much larger base, it's a much larger percentage of the total. So there are always 2 things going on. We said there's always 2 things going on in our product line. The commodity business was in decline, and the engineered systems business was ramping very rapidly. Now that the commodity business is small and the engineered business is large, a much larger percentage of the total, the impact on the overall number is very positive because as Exa doubles, that's going to move the needle dramatically. So we expect that the hardware story this current fiscal year to be a growth story driven largely by Exa and a growth story not just on the top line but also great margin expansion to go along with it.","Mark V. Hurd","Yes, and Heather to add to Larry's comments, as it relates to Exa itself, we had a pretty linear progression of improvement throughout the year. It might have a little more in 1 quarter than the other on that pure linear view. But Q4 was really, I think, nothing more than the culmination of a consistently growing pipeline through the year. And even with what we delivered in Q4, we also, in Q4, saw our pipeline increase yet again. So I think it really has been all of the things you described. It's customer familiarity. It's us getting out showing the technology works. We have so many customers that have now not only tried the product, tested the product and now bought the product, implemented the product. It just all plays together. And I think to Larry's point, we expect a very strong year in Exa in fiscal 2013.","Safra A. Catz","Let me just say one other thing, Heather, that I don't know if we mentioned it on this call so far, is that we do expect hardware numbers to be up for the year. So year-over-year, we do expect them to be positive.","Operator","And our next question comes from Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just have a question on the applications business. You saw a really strong license growth there this quarter, definitely a pretty substantial snapback over the past couple. Just curious here what is driving that re-acceleration, that applications growth rate. And then also, Larry or Mark, I wonder if you can provide any specifics around any sort of Cloud wins or Fusion wins or kind of early feedback on those 2, that'd be great.","Mark V. Hurd","On the app side, I'd just make this comment. It was broad-based. There is no single region. There is no single deal. And by the way, it was cross-pillar, if I can use that word. It was strength in CRM, strength in ERP, strength in HCM. So it was broad-based, and I really can't give you a region. And by the way, that includes Europe. So it was fairly broad-based, across pillar and across region. In terms of fast wins, I'll turn it over to Larry. He mentioned a couple, and he can touch a little bit about some of our progress in the cloud and wins there.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Yes, well, when we announced the Oracle Cloud a short while ago, we put up a lot of wins against salesforce.com, a lot of wins against Workday. So right now, we're the only major application supplier that has a large business in SaaS and a large business in on-premise. So we're really completing in both sides of the business. And I think that bodes very well for our future. So depending on -- the customers are somewhat self-selecting. They come in wanting a SaaS solution for HCM, we have something to sell them. They come in wanting a SaaS solution for sales force automation or service automation or for that matter, financials, accounting. We have something to sell them. We also, obviously, can deliver that same solution on-premise. It just gives us, I think, a terrific competitive advantage, both the breadth of what we sell in applications, as well as the fact that we offer on-premise solutions and in-the-cloud solutions. And let me throw out -- the last piece is we -- maybe the most outstanding of all of the application areas. And again, I could -- look, second to Mark said, it was very broad-based. But perhaps the most outstanding was our industry-specific applications, which had a phenomenal fourth quarter. And that's, again, an area where Oracle differentiates itself against most of its competitors. We have Internet banking and loan origination and financial services. We have health care systems. We have retail merchandising systems. We have a lot of industry-specific applications that none of our big-name application competitors have. Big advantage in breadth and depth.","Mark V. Hurd","I think, adding to Larry's point, just to brag on our SaaS stuff yet again. Between the HCM release early in the year, as I mentioned in Q4, we integrated Taleo with the HCM team. The wins that Larry described earlier, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, UBS, just to name a couple, are material wins. Our win rate now is gone up to the point that we're winning most of the deals that we get down into a mano-a-mano square-off with our competitor. And we did a lot of work in Q4 to get that done. To Larry's point, you saw a ramp-up in CRM, in sales automation in the quarter, as well as we integrated RightNow into North America as well. So did a lot of work in Q4. And as Larry mentioned a week ago, as we did our Cloud launch, the number of wins was significant in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is about the increase in sales capacity. Mark, I think you mentioned 3,300 people. Where do you think you are in ramping that capacity? And where are you directing it as you head into next year? And maybe for Safra, how have you been able to do that and keep sales and marketing roughly flat year-on-year?","Mark V. Hurd","All right. I'll start and turn it over to Safra. They are going exactly where you would expect them to go. They are going into SaaS, very focused in HCM, very focused in service automation and sales automation. We also have growth on our industry business units, as Larry referenced. They're growing quite well, and they do a great job strategically for us. When they grow, a material amount of Oracle revenue flows with the industry applications as they go. So we're growing headcount in that area. We've grown headcount in our engineered systems. I mentioned the pipeline. You'll see the results in Q4. We have a focus in both Middleware selling where we believe we have a strong competitive lead over competition, namely IBM. In addition to that, we feel very good about the alignment of our BI offerings and the release of Exalytics. So all of those areas are focused areas where we're increasing our sales force and adding to it. Most of that work, again, was done in FY '12. We are working to increase the productivity as we assimilate those people into the organization this year. We will still have adds in fiscal year '13, but most of the hard work was done as part of FY '12. With that, I'll turn it over to Safra for comments on expenses.","Safra A. Catz","Well, what's really been done by Mark and his team is really reshape the sales force so that we have a lot more firepower: less staff, less helpers, more folks with quotas and delivering back to us. So as all those folks have -- are going into a full capacity, we're very excited about this next year. But we've really reshaped the sales force during FY '12, and we're able to keep expenses where they needed to be by really changing our ratios.","Operator","The next we'll hear from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm curious to get your thoughts on overall macro environment. Not that -- Safra's already pointed out that you guys aren't economists. But what's the tone of customer conversations like? And I guess a follow-up for Safra. How conservative are the close-heard assumptions to generate the forecast? And I have a follow-up.","Mark V. Hurd","I'll let Safra deal with any questions about the macro economy.","Safra A. Catz","Well, Kash, I'm sorry to disappoint you. We have not become economists this quarter, and we don't have any idea what's going to happen. So you've been in this with us a couple times, and so you know that as a general matter, we look at what's going on. I try to stay conservative. Who knows? Depending on what's happening. It was a very tumultuous end of May, as some of you remember. We closed our quarter and -- yes, I was actually in the Europe for part of it, as the news was full of a global catastrophe. So we keep that on our mind. Our European team, EMEA team did absolutely magnificently. And as in all our regions worldwide, in the face of this, I'd like to stay conservative but it may not turn out being conservative depending on the euro, depending on whatever. And of course, we always do feel some level of uncertainty as folks run to the dollar. And of course, I've got to keep that in mind also ultimately, and you guys need to keep that in mind in your models. The tone from our customers, a lot of customers understand the value that we bring to them. We are important and very strong partners for them to reach their own goal. And as a general matter, as you can see the results that our customers vote with their pocketbook. And we expect them to do the same this next year.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And if I could, the engineering system, Larry, your point this has been on a tear [ph]. Can you give some feel for if the business is going to double again, who you are going to be winning market share against relative to the cast of characters: IBM, HP, Teradata? These are some high-end systems companies that come to mind. Just curious if you can give us some color of who you hope to get share from.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Well, I think this coming year, most of the share will be from the high-end guys. So we'll be encroaching on the suppliers of high-end servers, and the leader of the supplier of high-end servers is IBM, and then there are specialized players like Teradata. But it's going to be in the high end. Long term, Kash, I think it's more interesting. Long term, the Exadata, Exalogic, Exalytics machines, because they are built out of commodity parts deliver -- again, not only allow us to encroach and become the #1 player at the high-end and peak performance. I think it will -- we have a good chance of becoming the #1 player in cost performance, and that allows us to take share from the commodity guys. And we're very excited about that prospect for our long-term growth of the Exa line. However, for next year, I think the primary competitor is IBM pSeries.","Operator","And our final question will come from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Safra, I just wanted to follow up on Kash's question and see if you saw any changes at all in pricing or renewal rates at all during the quarter.","Safra A. Catz","No, everything stayed really, really strong. It was really kind of 2 stories, meaning what we were seeing on the news and what we were seeing in our business. So everything remained really strong. We had a lot of big renewals, a lot of -- everything just went business as usual. And it was a great quarter end, I mean, obviously. And everybody remained really, really strong all the way all around the world.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Ken Bond","Thank you. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found on the press release issued earlier today.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2019 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.

","Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll first go over Q3 results before moving on to guidance. I\u2019ll then turn the call over to Mark and Larry.","As in prior quarters, I\u2019ll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $6.7 billion, up 4% in constant currency and now accounts for nearly 70% of total company revenue, largely recurring revenue. As in past quarters, we are seeing robust double-digit growth rates for total cloud revenue in all regions, with especially strong growth in Asia-Pacific.","In terms of product categories, ERP grew in the mid-30s and the verticals grew in the high-30s. Our Software business, which is the totaling of cloud services and license support revenue with cloud license and on-premise license revenue, is 82% of total revenue and it grew 3% in constant currency. Our Software business has remained extremely stable and resilient as we have made the transition to faster growing SaaS business that entailed trading nonrecurring upfront license revenue for recurring long-term subscription revenue.","Through adoption of Autonomous Database and OCI, we are now shifting the focus for infrastructure business to the cloud. As a percentage of our total software business, cloud is now more than double what it was just three years ago and provides us with the ability to accelerate overall software revenue growth as this mix shift continues.","GAAP applications total revenue were $2.8 billion, up 7% and GAAP infrastructure total revenues were $5.1 billion, up 2%. Gross margin for cloud services and license support was 86%, essentially the same as last year, with continuing improvement in SaaS gross margins, stability in software support gross margins and continued investment in Oracle cloud infrastructure. Once our Cloud business is at scale, I expect our gross margins will go significantly higher.","Total revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 5% from last year. And the operating margin was 44%, up from 43% last year.","This quarter last year was greatly impacted by the change in the U.S. tax law, so comparing the GAAP numbers is not very meaningful after pretax income. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20%, up from 16% catch-up rate last year and non-GAAP EPS was $0.87 and up 12% in constant currency. This quarter the GAAP tax rate was 11% and GAAP EPS was $0.76.","Operating cash flow over last four quarters is $14.8 billion. Over the last four quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $13.2 billion, down 1% due to timing differences of tax payments and working capital items.","We have more than $40 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion, up 5% in constant currency.","The remaining performance obligations, or what I\u2019ll refer to as contract backlog, will be in the Q and is now $31.5 billion, of which approximately 62% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.","Since we remain committed to returning value to shareholders through acquisitions, internal investments and a return of capital with stock repurchases and dividends, this quarter we repurchased 206 million shares for a total of $10 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 728 million shares and reduced the absolute shares outstanding by nearly 16%, and the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 26% from $0.19 to $0.24 per share.","Turning to currency. I expect the strengthening U.S. dollar will continue with a currency headwind of 3% for Q4 revenue and a $0.03 headwind to earnings per share. ","Okay. So with that, let me turn to the guidance. So for Q4, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency and 0% to negative 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 15% to 19% and be between $1.08 and $1.12 in constant currency so we will deliver double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth for fiscal year 2019.","Taking into account the $0.03 currency headwind, non-GAAP EPS for Q4 in USD is expected to grow between 12% and 16% and be between $1.05 and $1.09 in USD. My EPS guidance assumes the base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that a normalizing for onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20%.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark for his comments.","Mark Hurd","Thanks, Safra. A solid quarter for us from top to bottom. Total revenue was up 3% in constant currency with. EPS 12%, plus 12% constant currency. In our apps ecosystem, we continued our momentum growing at 7% and that was an acceleration for us and over $11 billion in trailing 12 months revenue and 92% of that is now recurring.","We continue to grow revenue faster than market and we have an enormous opportunity ahead of us in ERP and HCM. In terms of SaaS revenue and bookings, Fusion apps were up 35%. By the way, our overall ERP and HCM annualized SaaS revenue is now $2.8 billion. That\u2019s up in the mid-20s. Fusion Apps, 35% up, Fusion ERP revenue was up 47% organically. NetSuite revenue was up 28%. Bookings were up actually even higher in the mid-30s.","Our vertical revenue was up 38% and our annualized revenue in the verticals is now over $800 million. I\u2019m going to read you a quick quote from IDC and I have to read it precisely or I\u2019ll get cards and letters. So let me just make sure I do this exactly as it\u2019s written. \u201cPer IDC\u2019s latest annual market share results, Oracle is the number one enterprise applications vendor in North America based on market share and revenue, surpassing salesforce.com and SAP.\u201d We\u2019ve seen this momentum building. So this is not any surprise to us, but I think it\u2019s always better when you can see it in real numbers from somebody other than us.","Let me switch briefly to infrastructure. Our GAAP techie co-system was $21 billion on a trailing 12 months basis and Q3 was up 2%. And Autonomous Database, our momentum continues to build. We now have 4,000 new trials that were added in Q3 alone.","Nearly 1,000 paying customers. We\u2019re adding many new customers and we\u2019re seeing great pull-through, with 20% of our Autonomous Data Warehouse trials also using analytics. We have over 35 referenceable customers and we expect to be greater than 100 soon. Cloud customer revenue was up triple digits for the fourth consecutive quarter.","So overall, a solid quarter and we hit our revenue targets and saw 12% EPS growth. Climbing renewal rates gives me the confidence that our Cloud Apps businesses is only going to strengthen from here and going forward begin the visibility we have into the revenue backlog, which Safra touched on a bit earlier.","Looking forward, I do expect FY 2020 revenue growth will be higher than FY 2019. And EPS this year will be certainly grow double digits, as Safra mentioned. I\u2019m going to give you a few customer wins as well. Try to give you a flavor for what happened in the quarter for us. Most of these didn\u2019t affect our revenue. Most of these are all really bookings that occurred in the quarter, but I thought I\u2019d give you some context about some people in our user base as well as outside our user base.","For example, comp group in the Netherlands, E-Business Suite migration, master brands cab threats in the U.S., an E-Business Suite migration. Tyson Germany, an E-Business Suite migration. Watson, E-Business Suite migration. I gave you those, a few of those examples. Those are core sort of E-Business engineering company. Core sort of E-Business Suite customers as we see this acceleration of our user base moving to the cloud.","We had a couple people soft ERP migrations, mutual in the quarter. DePaul University and a slew of wins again, I reference that a lot of the ERP user base that\u2019s out there today is outside of our user base or even our traditional on-premise competitor from, if you will, the old days.","On semiconductor, nice win in the quarter. Packaging Corporation of America, again, outside of our user base for the quarter. Eaton, another manufacturer in the Netherlands. I could go on, which in the sake of time I won\u2019t, although I\u2019ll mention Ashford Hospitality. These are, again, outside our user base that are brand-new customers to Oracle in the area of ERP.","In HCM, Abu Dhabi airports, ADT, Bloom Bank, Great Canadian gaming, we had a really nice win at a company called the Nova Healthcare. This again was not inside our user base. These were traditional cost where we actually did multi-pillar ERP back office and HCM connected together. So I\u2019ll stop there, in the sake of time, but just a really, again, very impressive set of customers and a good mix of net new logo as well as movement from our user base.","We had a pretty good quarter with some really quality names on the platform side. Fair Isaac, shared services in Italy, Joanne Stores, some really nice beginnings of what you see as we move to our gen 2 cloud and Autonomous Database.","I did want to make a couple quick comments on our growing relationship with The Gap. It was a global retailer. Revenue greater than $16 billion. We\u2019ve been working with The Gap and their transformation to what\u2019s really a multi-cloud environment, but using many, many Oracle technologies and they include really everything we\u2019ve got.","SaaS, PaaS, delivering innovation, reliability and scalability at every turn and as part of even the things they\u2019re using in the private cloud, those are all really enabled by Exadata and we\u2019re really thrilled to be Gap\u2019s extra tee partner in their effort. That\u2019s a few quick wins for the quarter. So overall good, solid quarter for us on the income statement side, but also in the quality of these bookings that we\u2019re describing or that I\u2019ve been describing.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry.","Larry Ellison","Thank you, Mark. Oracle\u2019s future rests on two strategic businesses, cloud applications and cloud infrastructure. The growth in our cloud applications business has been driven by our Fusion suite and NetSuite. Both the Fusion suite of applications and NetSuite are growing very, very rapidly. Mark gave you the numbers.","As the names imply, both Fusion and NetSuite with integrated suites of MRI cases, including sales, service, human resources, financials, supply chain and manufacturing applications. No other cloud services provider has such a comprehensive suite of applications covering both the front office and the back office. Most customers want their cloud services provider to make their applications work together. Customers do not like to be responsible for the complex process of integrating lots of different applications, running on lots of different vendor\u2019s clouds.","We think our integrated suite approach to the cloud applications business is a primary reason for the very rapid growth in our cloud applications market share. The introduction of our gen 2 highly secure infrastructure featuring the Oracle Autonomous Database has been very well received. During Q3, we had nearly 1,000. Over 4,000 active trials.","Our infrastructure technology is highly differentiated from AWS. Each one of our cloud computers has a separate security processor and memory, insulate customers from intruding upon each other and it also makes our cloud control code inaccessible by customers.","No other cloud services provider offers this kind of protection across their entire public cloud. The Oracle Autonomous Database is the only database that can respond to a security threat by automatically. No down time is required. No other database has this capability. Oracle technology leadership and cloud infrastructure and database plus our market leadership and cloud applications makes us very optimistic about our future.","I\u2019ll turn it back to you, operator. Operator, if we could turn to Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Thank you. Good afternoon. Mark, I wanted to ask a question of you. Last month when we were together at our tech conference you reiterated that this goal, second half 2019, sales growth would accelerate on a constant currency basis versus first half and I\u2019m not trying to be knit picky but I think it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s accelerating much.","So I was just wondering if anything changed and I also wanted to ask about fiscal 2020 which you just mentioned that fiscal 2020 constant currency revenue growth would be higher than fiscal 2019. I guess what I\u2019m wondering is should we be thinking that that constant currency growth acceleration that you\u2019re referring to for fiscal 2020 is similar to the type of acceleration in the second half of fiscal 2019 or could it be more meaningful? Thank you.","Mark Hurd","Yes. So let\u2019s go back. I think 2019 will grow faster than 2018 second half is whatever your adjective is around it, grow faster than first half. FY 2020 faster than 2019. When you get in underneath it what are the drivers. At a big level first, our growing businesses are becoming a bigger part of our total than our other businesses. So as an example, just one example, Cloud ERP gets bigger, hardware gets smaller, obviously those have offsetting effects.","In addition, we have things that attach with that for example, our consulting services business now in on-premise has been declining but our cloud consulting is inclining, as does our overall bookings. So as a result, these just offset each other. Within it, clearly, I\u2019ve given you the numbers on certain parts of our apps as an example of ERP and HCM which are growing substantively. Larry\u2019s comments about Autonomous Database are two huge drivers of growth as we go forward.","So I think all those statements, 2019 versus 2018, second half, first half, 2019 to 2020 are all where you\u2019re going to see acceleration of top-line growth in CD.","Ken Bond","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from John DiFucci with Jeffries & Company.","John DiFucci","Thank you. So your aggregate results have been I guess relatively steady might be the right way to characterize it. And during this period, I think investors really appreciate the share buybacks and the dividend, dividend increase this quarter. I guess I want to sort of follow on with that line of thinking, Mark, and this uptick in fiscal 2020 and you talked a lot about your Cloud Apps and we get a lot of information on that but can you talk a little bit about what extent the data base options might be a driver to some of that revenue acceleration and how big is the Middleware business at this point?","Mark Hurd","I\u2019ll start. I\u2019ll let Larry comment also a bit on the options. I think first, just when we get into on the database side, the big move here is to autonomous. I think we tried to give you some numbers of the level of interest. The level of \u2013 the increased interest coming from either end of Q1, early Q2 into Q3 was just \u2013 John, it was just substantive. It won\u2019t he show up in our revenue numbers yet.","I\u2019m talking in terms of trials and people testing and now frankly people buying. What we\u2019ve even seen, what\u2019s really nice, people buying something for as much as 15, 20, 25K as their first move into Autonomous Database and even within the quarter making a second purchase that turns into. These are really encouraging early signs for us. And then to the point that you bring up, we just don\u2019t get the database t we get analytics, we get other service that\u2019s come with it.","So as we continue to convert trials into real usage, real usage into expansion, this becomes a core he key driver as we move forward. I\u2019ll let Larry follow on with other parts of the options.","Larry Ellison","As people use Autonomous Database in the public cloud, they typically got by the multitenant option and the real application cluster option which are required options for Autonomous Database. So there\u2019s no question that the introduction of Autonomous Database and the consumption of Autonomous Database is that accelerates will increase the license purchases of those two options.","John DiFucci","And just the second part of my question, you used talk about middleware and how it was on-premise middleware stuff wasn\u2019t growing, was declining. Can you tell us even just roughly how big that is at this point? You sort of alluded to some of these other businesses that weren\u2019t growing or getting smaller and smaller.","Mark Hurd","We never break that out, John, so to my knowledge, unless \u2013 I\u2019m not going to break \u2013 I\u2019m not going to start breaking it out today, but clearly, we\u2019re \u2013 middleware is moving if you will from like everything else from on-premise into the cloud. We\u2019ve got a full suite of services in the cloud. But we\u2019re not going to break it out into a discrete business today.","Larry Ellison","I can say a couple of parts of middleware are doing quite well. I think it\u2019s a mixed story. I think analytics are doing very well in the cloud. As Mark mentioned, 20% of Autonomous Database goes out with analytics and have had java had a very good quarter.","Mark Hurd","I had one last point. Security is faster growing business as we could have within the context of the Middleware business as well. Again, the problem in middleware, it\u2019s not a thing. It\u2019s multitenant products within it. Like many things we\u2019ve talked about, many things growing fast and things declining simultaneously.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.","Phil Winslow","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a strong quarter. Just want to build on John\u2019s question there about the reacceleration you had in database. When I think about what really differentiates Oracle and cloud, it\u2019s the gen 2 OCI that we continue to get increasingly positive data points on and then also adding autonomous platform on top of it.","My question is with the autonomous Data Warehouse being out for a year and the transactional process being out since August, how should we think about those two combining, to the reacceleration on top of ACI and you mentioned the thousand customers and 4,000 trials, what is actually the driver of people shifting over, is it speed? Is it cost? Is it performance? Just some more color on that would be great so timing and then why.","Mark Hurd","I\u2019ll let Larry start.","Larry Ellison","Okay. All right. So the driver is many different things. Some of our customers were stunned that they can get a database up and running in five minutes. We\u2019ve been collecting references and studying the thousand customers and the 4,000 trials and what they find encouraging about the Autonomous Database. Certainly, we\u2019ll call it productivity improvements. The fact they can go from not having a database, not having hardware, literally log onto our cloud. Up and runnings and doing useful things in five minutes is proving to be a shock to a lot of our customers.","So getting things up and running quickly, productivity has been a very big issue. We\u2019ve got one customer who\u2019s done a series of tests. AWS user and I know we had these ads that promised cut your AWS bill in half. They found that we were running 11.5 times faster than they were running on AWS and they cut their bill by 80%. These are university researchers. So they\u2019re very, very cost sensitive and they felt it was worthwhile making the move, just because we were much less expensive, Autonomous Database was way less expensive than Redshift or Aurora at Amazon.","Some people they had an existing Data Warehouse and it was just the compatibility, being able to take an existing Data Warehouse, not spooling up a new one in five minutes but taking an existing Data Warehouse, lifting it and shifting each other. We\u2019re seeing all of those use cases. Productivity, motivators, I should say. Productivity, compatibility and cost. All driving the usage of Autonomous Database.","Mark Hurd","We\u2019ve never had a release in the database area where we could actually talk to a CEO about what was in the release and the CEO would go I completely get it. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re talking about partitioning or something like that. When you talk about the fact that this database patches itself our customers at the CEO level now understand what a patch is. They understand why it\u2019s so important, why it\u2019s so strategic. They in many cases have to discuss it with their audit committees. The fact that now patching goes from a problem to where they pass that to us and it gets done instantaneously, we have many customers who said if this thing did nothing but that, I would migrate to Autonomous Database.","If the fact that \u2013 to Larry\u2019s point, this data base tunes itself, creates all its own indexes, that actually is labor \u2013 it\u2019s labor less and can you apply talent too. If it did nothing but give you better security and price and performance, so this is a release that the reason you\u2019re seeing the trials and the level why you hear enthusiasm the way it is the customer response is just extremely high because it just makes business sense.","This isn\u2019t something sold five levels down or four levels down in the org. This can be sold at the top of the company, if you will, at the CEO level. So it\u2019s why it\u2019s such an exciting release to us because the point it has so many business benefits to our customers as opposed to maybe the fact that you would think of traditionally many of our benefits being if you will technical. Its different explaining to a CEO what multitenant is and what in-memory is than frankly the benefits I\u2019ve just described.","Phil Winslow","Knowing how much we spend on patching I\u2019ve got a lead for your CRM system.","Safra Catz","I won\u2019t get too specific into your situation. You\u2019re a good use case with a very large bank with a tremendous amount of Oracle that frankly in many ways has done a fantastic job, but still has a window that has to be closed and this in terms of patch deployment and this is one vehicle to certainly a vehicle and the only vehicle I\u2019m aware of to get that done.","Phil Winslow","Well, Safra, can you give me quote for that reference. That would be great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the apps ecosystem. Mark, can you talk towards NetSuite because that\u2019s accelerated again this quarter and I was just wondering, look, when we talked about a few quarters ago it was like we tried to bring it over 20, but now we\u2019re in the high-20s. Was there anything special going on or is that kind of \u2013 is there anything in terms of new run rate that we need to be aware of? Thank you.","Mark Hurd","Well, I mean, as I\u2019ve said on multiple calls in a row, they\u2019ve been doing very well. I mean, this started tremendous acceleration we had last Q4 when their bookings growth was over 70% and you\u2019re just beginning to see that turn into now revenue.","So I believe the new rate is sustainable. And I actually think we can do better and our strategy\u2019s been very simple, and I know I\u2019ve said it before, but it\u2019s been frankly no more complicated than any salespeople internationally and domestically. We\u2019ve done both too, if you localize the product for more countries. We\u2019ve done many new countries that we\u2019ve now released in addition though that, we\u2019ve been building out more verticals, what we call suite success where we actually bundled in the implementation with what we sell and that\u2019s very, very popular with our customers.","So I think the team has also done a marvelous job executionally. I know I say my comments pretty quick but as much as the ref flew grew in the quarter, our bookings actually grew faster than the revenue and so we\u2019re very excited about NetSuite. We have been excited about NetSuite. And I think that will continue to perform and I actually think we can do better than even what I just described today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James.","Michael Turits","Hi, guys. Good evening. So you\u2019ve been seeing accelerating growth in cloud ERP and HCM and other areas of cloud. Is that growing accelerating enough and becoming a big enough piece of the business that we can now start to see an acceleration in the Cloud business overall which had some other headwinds?","Mark Hurd","I mean, I guess he\u2019ll start. As I said in my comments, ERP and HCM are becoming a bigger and bigger part of our business. I mean, today our annual SaaS revenue and ERP and HCM\u2019s approaching $3 billion. It\u2019s growing sort of mid-20s. And I think it\u2019s going to get nothing but better and better.","Again, I don\u2019t want to get too positive only in the context that we\u2019re beginning to see acceleration in some key parts. And so we are very focused on our competitors by brand and by industry. We deploy our sales force against those brands and against those industries as well as into our own user base and the reason I read the references the way I read them was so you\u2019d get a flavor that both our own user base is beginning to move in bigger numbers as well as the fact that we get competitive.","Remember, most of that user base is not sitting with us or traditional on-premise competitors. So, yeah, I mean, clearly it\u2019s a point of what I made earlier and I\u2019ll stop after this to say that our growing businesses are becoming bigger and bigger and you start putting the growth rates I\u2019m describing on numbers like $3 billion and you can do your own math and so we\u2019re very confident and feel very good about our position in those businesses.","Michael Turits","Thanks, Mark. If I could a follow up, quick one for Safra. Safra, you managed to keep CapEx low even with the OCI investment. Any expect to change in that trajectory where we\u2019re spending more capital.","Mark Hurd","No, I expect it to be very similar this next quarter to this past quarter and for the year it\u2019s basically the same, a little bit less than last year, so that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re looking at. Of course, if there\u2019s a huge opportunity we may push the gas a little more, but you have to understand that our SaaS operation is really humming and we\u2019re getting enormous economies of scale there. That\u2019s why the margins keep improving and so we\u2019re able to sort of do it all within the same investment envelope so far.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein research.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you very much for taking my question. I\u2019m going to do something you haven\u2019t done in a while. I\u2019m going to take a built of a liberty and ask two questions. The first is for salve RASM you talked a bit on the call about cash flow which is growing double digits was down roughly 1%. You gave some color on the call. Can you talk a little more about the underlying factors here, was timing or your definition of when you recognized cash flow having an impact? Are there other things that are impacting that cash? And then I have a follow up for Mark.","Mark Hurd","I mean, there are two things going on. If you look just at the quarter, it\u2019s nothing but cash collections, timing of cash collections, nothing more really than that to focus in on. If you look at year-to-date, which you may look at in one of the other schedules, it\u2019s that and some tax payments.","And that\u2019s really the two things going on. So nothing special going on, happens every once in a while. If you look back previous years, you will see that and it\u2019s a very Q3 thing, frankly. Because by then we\u2019re collecting up a lot of previous quarters\u2019 bookings. So \u2013 billings, excuse me. So that\u2019s really it. Nothing special.","Mark Moerdler","Then as a follow up for Mark. You\u2019ve given some color on the Autonomous Database. But can you specifically discuss the types of workloads that are driving adoption of autonomous and especially new clients for autonomous [new] clients for the Oracle Database.","Mark Hurd","I think the question police ought to get you for announcing you\u2019re going to ask two questions as opposed to just doing it.","Mark Moerdler","Sorry, Mark. I decided to be polite about it.","Mark Hurd","Yeah, that was very thoughtful. I don\u2019t know. Larry, you want to start in on that one?","Larry Ellison","Sure. I mean, there are \u2013 database does a lot of different things. The researchers that I mentioned earlier that moving from AWS for a big cost savings, they\u2019re doing a combination of machine learning and computer vision to look at tissue samples and detect anomalous cells. Cancer [based kit] are using computers to diagnose cancer and that\u2019s a combination of machine learning and the Autonomous Database and that\u2019s an all new application. So, there are several people that are coming in with all new applications in the cloud.","Actually, the one\u2019s moving from AWS. Then there are traditional on-premise customers who are simply taking one of their millions of Oracle Databases, there are millions of these things out there and just lifting one of those databases, either a transaction processing and the associated application, either transaction processing application or Data Warehousing application, just lifting it intact, moving the data over and moving the application over to compute, moving the data over to Autonomous Database and running the same exact thing in the cloud. They\u2019re experiencing sometimes shocking performance improvements also. We had one customer that moved from On-Premise into the cloud and the cloud system ran many times faster than their on-premise system.","Then there are customers that are moving, existing big Oracle customers that are moving new development, the new application that\u2019s they\u2019re developing from developing them on-premise, they move test and development into the Cloud and they\u2019re the ones that, again, the general reaction there is there\u2019s much, much more productive getting running, it\u2019s much cheaper to do test and development, much more responsive, much more productive to move test and development from their on-premise infrastructure to the cloud infrastructure. So online transaction processing, lifting and shifting applications, data warehousing, lifting and shifting, test and development, moving from AWS, there are lots of different use cases.","Mark Hurd","Just a couple quick follow-ons. Doing this off the top of my head Mark, I\u2019m roughly right. 20% of our customers on autonomous Data Warehouse, Autonomous Database right now are net new to Oracle. We did not have them before. And 80% are in our user base, roughly 70%, 75%, there\u2019s net no competition at all in the transaction. It\u2019s simply as Larry described a migration. 75% are actually into the LOB as opposed to IT, which I look at as very good news as well. So we\u2019ve got a lot of underpinning improving dynamics, my opinion, they\u2019re improving dynamics in terms of net new customers, in addition to movement of our database and certainly Analytical Data Warehousing is probably the biggest individual driver of anything we\u2019ve got.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.","Brad Zelnick","Excellent. Thanks so much. My question\u2019s for Mark. Mark, as we think about the traction you\u2019re seeing in cloud ERP and where the demand\u2019s coming from, there\u2019s the massive On-Premise installed base opportunity but I think might not appreciate that more than half the market is the long tail of niche legacy vendors that most people haven\u2019t even heard of. Can you just give us a sense for your success in displacing that long tail, how much you think you\u2019re participating there versus the more usual suspects?","Mark Hurd","I think that\u2019s exactly right, what you said. So I think it\u2019s common thought that the ERP market On-Premise is dominated by two vendors, Oracle and the company from Germany and those two vendors together have less than 50% of the market.","We have more Fortune 500 customers for example. They have many big customers. But the blizzard of implementations, there\u2019s a blizzard of companies, it\u2019s that have the more than 50% market share, 54%, 55%, most of them are moved into private equity. They\u2019re not even public companies. They\u2019re on their second or third turn through private equity. They\u2019ve got no migration plan to the Cloud. Coy go on and on with all of these. That\u2019s why, as I mentioned earlier, we actually line up our development resources and our sales resources very focused on these competitors.","They would have names like I mentioned a couple like McCormick and Dodge, if you\u2019ve heard of them. IBM believe it or not actually has got an old ERP system. There\u2019s a company called Deltek. There\u2019s a company called Lawson, a company called [ETHICA]. There\u2019s tens and tens of these, to your point and these are old, old pieces of code. These need to move.","They need to move to a more modern platform, and they are perhaps as attractive as any other market and in fairness, our user base actually knows our cloud roadmap. They actually have confidence in in our R&D, they know we\u2019re going to be there to migrate them when they want to be there. They actually have less of a sense of urgency in many cases to move than the companies you\u2019re describing, Brad, because they\u2019re in much more desperate situations without a roadmap, without knowing how they\u2019re going to get from here to there, knowing their competitors are beginning to move.","So we have as much success today and if you ask one of our salespeople would you rather have one of these competitive territories where you\u2019re going after one of these niche vendors or would you rather have an E business suite territory, many of our salespeople say give me that competitive territory because there\u2019s an absolute need to move as quick as you can.","So, yeah, it\u2019s an incredibly attractive market andit\u2019s why you hear us keep talking about it so much because the additional fact is when we sell ERP, we continue to see an attach rate to HCM and frankly an attach rate to even some of our other apps in the CX and front office area as well so it\u2019s why we\u2019re so focused on that opportunity.","Operator","I will now turn the call over to Ken.","Ken Bond","Thank you. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today.

Ken?","Ken Bond","Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which include a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.","As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. And these forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today.","As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.

Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3, I'll then review guidance for Q4 and then I'll turn the call over to Mark and then Larry. Just so you all know, we're not all in the same place today, so we may all answer at once, so give a chance.","Clearly, we are delighted with our results as software and cloud revenue was at the high end of my guidance and earnings per share $0.06, above the high end of my guidance. Our pivot to the cloud is now clearly in full strength. We continue to see outside growth rates in our cloud business, especially when compared with our key competitors who're all seeing slowing growth. But more importantly, the increase in revenue from our cloud business has overtaken new software license business decline on an annual basis.","Next year I expect our cloud revenue will be larger than our new software license revenue. The investments we've made to transition our business to the cloud has been important to ensure that Oracle remains a technology leader and we're now beginning to see the benefits in our results.","With cloud overtaking new software license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the previous decade as a license business that is growing revenue with disciplined cost management that results an EPS and cash flow that grow even faster. I expect EPS growth to ramp up throughout next year.","We continue to use constant dollar rates on our quarterly calls, so that we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters, as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This quarter, the effects of currency movement were largely in line with my guidance of 1% currency headwind for revenue, $0.01 negative impact to EPS.","Cloud, SaaS, and PaaS revenues for the quarter were $1.1million, up 86% from last year. You can also see the continued strength of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $2 billion, up 75% in U.S. dollars; and SaaS and PaaS billings grew 111% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail.","When you add together cloud, SaaS, PaaS revenues, and new software license revenue together, we grew 11% in constant currency. This is a significant milestone in our transformation where the combination of our cloud and new software license businesses added together are growing.","As cloud becomes an even larger percentage of the total, the growth will only accelerate with earnings and cash flow following along. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q3 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 65%, up from 51% last year, and I expect it to be about the same region in Q4. I expect that our total Saas and PaaS gross margin will continue to trend toward 80% overtime.","Cloud infrastructure as a service revenue was 178 million, up 19% from last year. The Q3 gross margin was 30%, as we continue to make the necessary investments to scale out this business. As we make additional investments, the expenses and immediately while the revenues recognized overtime, so the gross margin in this part of the business could decline to roughly about 20% over the next few quarters. After which, I expect gross margin will climb to more than 40% as the business scales.","Total cloud revenue in the quarter was approximately 1.3 billion, with growth modestly accelerating to 72% in constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were 6.2 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year.","Attach and renewal rates remained at their usual high levels, as our installed base of customers continued to grow, in fact they actually increased. New software license revenues were nearly 1.4 billion, down 15%, reflecting the continued emphasis on and migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support was down 9% with hardware systems product revenue of 520 million and hardware support revenue of $508 million, again reflecting our focus on the move to the cloud.","For the company, total revenue for the quarter was 9.3 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was 3.9 billion, up 4% from last year and the operating margin was 43%, up from 42% last year.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.6%, as the rate was favorably impacted by some onetime benefits and some other factors, including favorable geographic mix this quarter.","Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69 in USD, up from $0.64 and up 8% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 17% and the GAAP EPS was $0.53 in USD, up from $0.50 last year.","Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was 13.5 billion, which is lower because of the rapid growth we're seeing as we transition to cloud and having an impact on our working capital. Our operational metrics like DSO and Days Payable are stable, so it's just largely an effective growth on working capital and timing.","Capital expenditures for Q3 were 440 million with about third of it from real estate, while most of the rest was cloud build out and internal use. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was 11.8 billion. We now have approximately 69 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately 5 billion.","The short-term deferred revenue balance is 7.4 billion, up 7% in constant currency. This quarter, we purchased approximately 30 million shares for a total of 500 million. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 124 million shares for a total of 5 billion and paid out dividends of 2.5 billion. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 27% from $0.15 to $0.19 per share.","Now let me go to the guidance. Because we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates, we do also expect to see significant currency headwind. I am going to give you constant currency guidance, but if the current exchange rates remain the same throughout the quarter as they're right now, we actually expect to see currency headwind of 2% on revenue and $0.02 negative impact on EPS. These currency headwinds are higher than last quarter, meaning that most of your Q4 estimates do not yet reflect the incremental revenue and EPS headwinds of an additional negative impact of 1% and $0.01 to EPS.","All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis. With that my guidance is as follows. SaaS and PaaS revenue including NetSuite is expected to grow 69% to 73%, effectively raising my full year guidance from 80% to 81% for the year. We're beginning to see an increasing and favorable attach between our PaaS and IaaS order. So I'm going to provide guidance on IaaS as well this quarter.","IaaS is expected to grow 25% to 29%. Software and cloud revenue including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support is expected to grow 1% to 3%. Total revenue is expected to grow from negative 1 to positive 2. EPS is expected to be between $0.78 and $0.82 in constant currency. Now, this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%, but of course the Q4 tax rate could end up being different.","With that I'm going to turn this over to Mark and then Larry follows him.","Mark Hurd","Alright, thanks Safra. We thought Q3 would be strong going in and as you can see it turned out to be just that. I'm going to give you a bunch of numbers hear and try to give you a little bit more insight to the quarter. First, in ARR, we booked 545 million in USD. Every number I'm going to give you was actually in CD, I want to say it differently. 545 in USD, 547 in CD, that is up 73% and the second best quarter we had ever had.","SaaS bookings were 322 million in USD and PaaS infrastructure bookings were 223 in USD. Cloud revenue was up 72% and we're now in an annualized $5 billion run rate. Saas, Paas revenue was up 86%. We're the fastest growing scaled cloud business in the world and that is on top, that growth rate is on top of last year's 60%.","In ERP, we were up 280% organically and with NetSuite ERP is now our largest pillar. Fusion HCM was up 106%, that's more than three times the growth rate of Workday. CX was up 16% with marketing and service both over 100 million in quarterly revenue. Our vertical is up for 109% and also over 100 million in quarterly revenue.","Database as a Service was up 427%. Our database business including all of our on premise businesses net revenue. PaaS was up 375% year-to-date, with cloud services up 300%. As Safra mentioned Saas, PaaS billings were up 111% in USD, Saas, PaaS deferred revenue was up 75% in USD.","Now, some customer metrics, 1,125 new SaaS customers in the quarter, 908 expansions, 210 customers who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. CX, we had 480 new customers and 586 expansions. In HCM, we had 206 new customers and 217 expansions. In ERP, we had 564 new customers that did not include NetSuite; we got 120 expansions. 50% of our new ERP customers never had Oracle ERP before they bought this quarter. Our active base of ERP customers is now approaching 3,700, 1,465 are live, 10X Workday. In total we now have 13,103 customers in our SaaS active base and 25,000 with NetSuite.","Two thirds of our new customer wins were for Fusion. 243 Go-Lives for Fusion, 2,444 customers are now live on Fusion. We have 2,380 PaaS customers in the quarter and 2,586 new customers buying standalone infrastructure as a service. As a point of clarity, PaaS and infrastructure customers accounted for each service that they buy.","Lastly, this was an excellent quarter. Bookings, billings and revenue were all extremely solid. Now, a few predictions, Q3 bookings growth was strong, as I mentioned 73%. We will book at least 2 billion in ARR this year. Q3 revenue growth was impressive at 72% and with revenue now and an annualized run rate of 5 billion; we're clearly the fastest growing cloud company at scale.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Larry Ellison","Thank you, Mark. Let's say, generation two of Oracle's infrastructure as service cloud now has the ability to run customers' largest databases, something that is impossible to do using Amazon web services. Amazon can only run relatively small Oracle databases in their cloud.","Gen 2 of Oracle IaaS also delivers ultra high database performance and form caller reliability in the cloud. Many Oracle workloads now run ten times faster in the Oracle cloud versus the Amazon cloud. It also costs less to run Oracle workloads in the Oracle cloud than the Amazon cloud.","As a result some of our largest customers' are negotiating huge infrastructure as a service contracts to move all their databases to the Oracle cloud. You can expect some of those big deals to be announced in the coming weeks. Fast growth in the infrastructure as a service business is new for us. We've done well on SaaS and in PaaS over the past few years, but this is the first time we've ever had a technology lead in infrastructure as a service.","We're now in position to help our hundreds of thousands database customers move millions of Oracle databases to our infrastructure as a service cloud. SaaS and PaaS are large, rapidly growing businesses for us. Together SaaS and PaaS grew 85% this past quarter. But soon infrastructure as a service will be growing even faster and before long infrastructure as a service will become Oracle's largest cloud business.","In summary, all of Oracle's cloud businesses are growing rapidly and IaaS will be leading the way in the future. Thanks.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Larry. Holly, if we could prepare the audience for the Q&A portion of the call now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Kirk Materne","Thanks, very much and congrats on a very nice third quarter. My question is for Mark. Mark, obviously a really nice quarter across the board, but particularly from cloud bookings perspective, can you talk about what changed if anything in the quarter versus the second quarter either in terms of the macro backdrop or better execution and just relatedly we'll be interested in what you're seeing in the pipeline that gives you further confidence in that $2 billion ARR target. Thanks.","Mark Hurd","Kirk, I thought good about Q1, I thought good about Q2, I feel good about Q3, I didn't feel any major change. It's just really the timing of wins, bookings closed. We had a very strong set of quality wins. I mean if you win into HCM, I mean just to give you some idea Kirk, we closed America Movil in the quarter, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Ford, Emerson, Hilton, Hyundai Motor, Jefferies, Rogers Communications, I mean we had a very strong set of logos in the quarter. I mean in ERP, we closed ClubCorp, Cummins, Lufthansa, Dish Network, I mean it was just a - I could go on.","I don't have time to tell you all of these deals. But we saw it going in, we felt it would happen. It did and I think our team executed well. I would say Kirk that there was no - it wasn't geographically centered and it was pillar centered. As I mentioned earlier we had credible growth in ERP 280% organically, we had a 106% growth in HCM, we had strong in our sales automation business and it wasn't unique to one geography, so in the quarter broad based, cross pillar, cross geography.","In terms of going forward, our pipeline is big. I mean I said before, I'll say it again. Our pipeline's growth, if you looked at it year-over-year resembles all of the growth rates you've heard in terms of what you've seen in terms of our bookings growth this quarter. And I think our execution just continues to get better. I'll also add in the quarter that NetSuite's performance accelerated. So from the last reported quarter in terms of bookings growth, their growth in the quarter, which for them was an odd thing because they're not used to having December, January, February quarter, but when compare it apples-to-apples, they grew faster than the last reported quarter in terms of bookings as well, so it's a very good quarter for us.","Kirk Materne","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan","Hi, thank you very much. Mark, you must be wearing a suit and Larry, maybe you're wearing a sweater because you're talking tech and Mark is talking application, so I'm going to direct my applications question to Mark if you don't mind. Mark, can you talk about what's ahead for cloud SaaS, obviously there is manufacturing, order entry, supply chain, those kinds of things that could book to the cloud. How should we think about the cycle ahead in that regard? Thank you very much.","Mark Hurd","It is a big change for us in ERP. This is not the world of two providers and I was talking about upgrade cycles. What happened to us in ERP and I go back to the fact that 50% of our customers in the quarter were just brand-new. So, they never had bought ERP from us before.","Ad what happened is our total available market has just become incredibly large. If you looked at the persona of our customers that are in the ERP cloud today, they were not - most of them, more than 50% of them today were not in Oracle ERP customer her before they bought from us. So, I don't think, cash, it's really more of a cycle. I think it's really more of just an inflection point for us in terms of - we're now at a place where we have almost 4,000 customers in ERP SaaS.","Many of our on-prem customers have not moved and yet we're in a position where we can go get a whole set of customers that we never had access to before. Mid-market customers, we can do that globally and we can go now for customers that want to move to a SaaS application in the cloud and get all of those benefits. Frankly, our competitors' user bases have all opened up to us.","And so, I don't see it quite as a cycle of that. I see it as a big change in the opportunity for us in terms of the total available market we can go after. Larry may have a comment or two he would like to add as well.","Larry Ellison","No, again, I couldn't agree with Mark more. Our ability now to service much smaller customers than we could have serviced in the past is because the cloud allows you to deploy ERP in much, much lower costs. You don't have to have ERP. You don't have to build the data center. Obviously, you don't have to hire programmers. You don't have to hire a bunch of data operations people.","We do all that for you, and therefore the available market has at least doubled what it used to be. And we're also beginning to see, as Mark said, SAP customers moving their ERP and some very, very large SAP customers looking very closely at our ERP systems. So, we expect to have some big wins in the SAP install base, so we're definitely going out from there in the coming month.","Ken Bond","Next question, please.","Operator","And our next question is going to come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital.","Raimo Lenschow","Hey, thank you and congrats from me as well. I had a question around 12C. So, you have 12C now in the cloud for a good few months and I saw last week that it's now available on-premise. Can you talk a little bit about the early feedback from customers you saw and released to in the cloud and what did it mean - what does it mean now that it's available on-premise? Obviously, in the olden days that kind of spiked a little bit of an uptick in the database license growth, I'm just wondering how we have to think about it now in the new cloud world. Thank you.","Larry Ellison","I will give you one thing that's important to note that our cloud business, our license business per database is growing. So, our on-prem database business continues to grow. I'm not talking about the board, I'm talking about new licenses. That business is growing and grew this past Q3. An awful lot of our customers are planning to move their database workloads to our cloud, but they're going to bring their own license. In other words, they own a bunch of Oracle license and they're just going to move those licenses to our infrastructure as a service.","So, we expect our database license business to continue to grow. That should continue to respond kind of as it had in the past. In other words, the cool new features become available faster in memory processing, the ability to take an existing single tenant application and automatically turn into a multi-tenant application to be very attractive to our customers and our ISDs, they will buy more licenses, they may then in turn bring those licenses to the cloud. So, we expect our on-premise or better said, our database license business to continue to grow and accelerate because of 12.","Raimo Lenschow","Perfect. Thank you.","Mark Hurd","Just as a follow-up because I know what Larry meant, it's our database business grew, support plus license plus database as a service, those three categories together, our database business grew in the quarter. Next question?","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.","Philip Winslow","Hey, thanks guys and congrats on a great quarter. I really wanted to focus on in particular on the PaaS line, because obviously you guys put up a huge ARR quarter there. Safra, you mentioned increasing the PaaS, sort of IaaS to PaaS, part of our thesis has been, since you rolled out the new Datacenter 2.0 model on IaaS, that increasing attach there would then drive acceleration in the PaaS business. So, the question to, I guess, all three of you and I'll jump off, is what are you seeing since the announcement of - you had opened world on the IaaS side and how is that impacting? How do you expect it to impact the PaaS business?","Mark Hurd","Well, I mean, Phil, there is a lot of questions you had in one question there. So, I mean I think the point we've continued to try to indicate is that we've seen a continual connect first PaaS to SaaS. So, we've got a bunch of SaaS customers who typically buy an application and now we're starting to get up into where we see 20%, 25% connectivity. When somebody buys the SaaS application, they buy PaaS.","I think part of what we're talking about with attach with infrastructure is it becomes a bit harder to differentiate in some cases what is a pure infrastructure and what is PaaS, because the customer now buys the computer, buys the computing, buys the storage, et cetera along with PaaS and so you begin to get upward and to a degree of the infrastructure business and the database business, but no question about it. We continue to see the attach rates continue to incline of PaaS to our SaaS business, which I think was your - at the core of your first question, Phil.","Philip Winslow","Yeah, sort of the [indiscernible].","Safra Catz","Yes. For our database customers, when they come in, they can order PaaS. They can bring or they can bring their licenses, use IAS and as a general matter when they are running a database where they got something else too and so they're going to need some IAS to actually run their application when they're not our SaaS application. So, we're seeing these together very often. And so, I figured as we've now moved - as we're moving to our more advanced IAS from what you used to have, I thought I would break it out for you to see it.","Philip Winslow","Great, thanks, guys.","Safra Catz","Okay.","Ken Bond","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies and Company.","John DiFucci","Thank you. My question is for Safra. Safra, you've previously talked about double-digit constant currency earnings growth for next year. You had meaningful outperformance this quarter and your guide was better than where the street is. I guess you also mentioned in your prepared remarks about EPS ramping through next year. I guess just to clarify, do you expect to still achieve double-digit growth? And is that exiting the year it'll be double-digit growth or are you talking about for the entire year?","Safra Catz","So, I expect that when you look at the entire year, it will be double-digit growth, but it will start smaller and get bigger as we get through the year. So, Q1, I don't know right now. It's a little too early. We'll talk again as to what I'm going to see. Things look nice. But I'm going to - we'll talk again in June on Q1. And I think by the end of the year, the only question is, which quarter would drive into double-digit? And it's a little too early to tell but I expect to see it for the year.","John DiFucci","Okay, okay. Great and just if I could a quick follow-up on a related profitability note, the one thing in the results this quarter was cash flow actually declined from a year ago, I think, this quarter. You mentioned in your prepared remarks working capital and timing issues. Can you just provide a little more detail on what you mean by that?","Safra Catz","Yeah. I mean there is really nothing in it. It is pretty much just timing of when we paid stuff and things like that. I mean we would be filing our Q, our plan is to filing on Friday. You can spend the weekend digging through it. We dug through. There is nothing interesting going on whatsoever. We're growing and it's really just timing of different working capital impacting account, really nothing in particular.","John DiFucci","Okay, great. Looking forward to that weekend. Thank you.","Ken Bond","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","Thank you guys, for taking my question and a nice quarter. A new one for Larry just to clarify sort of the positioning on infrastructure as a service, when we think about sort of Gen 2 offering, is the positioning a platform for your customers to run workloads primarily or was it just more of a general purpose platform that you expect to go head on with AWS and Azure for general purpose type workloads?","Mark Hurd","It's absolutely a general purpose workload, because Oracle database is a backend. We have no idea what that application might be. It could be on our backing application. It could be our DNA, basically our matching application. There are millions or tens of millions of Oracle applications running. They're going to have to move the infrastructure as a service and the backend will probably run all the databases in PaaS, but we have to have a completely generalized infrastructure as a service offering that we built and we think we have performance and cost advantages with our new Gen 2 over both Amazon and Azure.","Keith Weiss","Excellent, thank you.","Operator","And our next question is going to come from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie.","Sarah Hindlian","Great, thank you so much and congratulations on the quarter, I would love Safra, if you could give us an early indication or any potential impact do you expect on the business model from SaaS B and IaaS B initiating new revenue recognition policies. Whatever you are seeing or thinking there that we should be starting to think about would be helpful.","Safra Catz","Sure, for us it's no big deal actually. It's really very much a non-event. I do hear one of our competitors talking all sorts of stuff about it. No, stuff for us to minimize [ph]. Maybe they're trying to talk about something else, but in our case we're not actually early adopting, but it doesn't make a difference really. Zero impact whatsoever on cash flows and no impact on what we disclosed to you or any of the things that these other companies talking about. For us it's really nothing.","Sarah Hindlian","Alright, thank you. That's very helpful.","Operator","Okay. And our final question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Great, thank you so much for taking the question. Just one is actually for Larry. I was wondering if you can share with us, it does appear that the company is coming to an inflection point in regards to your transition of the cloud and given the results from today and your commentary about Q4 and the earnings growth for next year, how long do you think this could run?","Larry Ellison","Well, we have a very, very large database business. We have hundreds of thousands of database customers and we have millions and millions of applications that run on the Oracle database. Most of those databases and most of those customers will move most of their databases and most of these workloads to the cloud. And we think our cloud will be - right now we have a huge technology lead over both Amazon and Azure with our new Generation 2 infrastructure as a service. We can deliver ultrahigh performance.","People have been buying these Exadata Database Machines and are getting used to running very large databases very, very fast and we can deliver comparable ultrahigh performance at very, very low cost in our cloud. So, we think how long does it take to migrate several hundred thousand customers and several million databases to the Oracle cloud and I think the rate of migration is going to accelerate over the years, but it's going to be at least a five-year run of very, very rapid growth as our database business begins to move.","You've seen what it's like. Our application business began to move to the cloud several years ago and - but that's a little bit different. I mean we built all new application and they migrated from an old application, either an SAP application or an old PeopleSoft application or E-Business Suite and they migrated to our new Fusion ERP suite. That's a very different than simply lifting up an Oracle database workload and moving it over to Oracle.","The application goes to infrastructure as a service and then the database goes to platform as a service. That's the faster process, but a much larger install base. Again my estimate is that business will move over - the majority will move over the next five years and that's going to give us enormous growth rates over that five-year period.","Heather Bellini","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Ken Bond for closing comments.","Ken Bond","Thank you everybody and thank you Holly. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issues earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department for any follow-up questions from this call.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.","On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.","As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made today.","As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors. And other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. As a reminder, Safra\u2019s comments today will use constant dollar growth rates unless stated otherwise and Mark\u2019s comments will use U.S dollar growth rate.","And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revisit our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q4 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. As you can see, we had another solid quarter. But before discussing Q3, let me just point out that the GAAP income statement was impacted by one-time net charge totaling $6.9 billion related to 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This is clearly a onetime event, so for use of comparison, we have excluded it from our non-GAAP calculation.","Now back to the quarter. Total cloud and software revenue were $8 billion, up 7% and up 3% in constant currency. Inside of cloud and software revenue, GAAP total revenue for application, which is new licenses, license updates including support and SaaS were $2.7 billion, up 9% or 6% in constant currency and GAAP total revenues for platform and infrastructure, which is new licenses, license update, including support and PaaS and IaaS were $5.3 billion, up 8% or 3% in constant currency.","Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 21% on a GAAP basis from last year in constant currency with -- on non GAAP basis with Fusion Cloud revenues up 52% in constant currency. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues for the quarter were $416 million, up 24% from last year in constant currency. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue, excluding legacy posting services, saw growth of 49% in constant currency and 56% in U.S dollars. As legacy hosting services become smaller part of total PaaS and IaaS, the underlying growth of PaaS and next generation IaaS will be more visible.","As for cloud margins, our SaaS business continues to scale in grow and the gross margin has expanded to 67%, up from 65% last Q3. We expect to see further improvement and remain committed to our goal of 80% PaaS gross margin. Now the gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 35%, down from last year. However, in looking ahead, I believe we\u2019re at the point where PaaS and IaaS gross margins will begin to improve with Q4 slightly higher than Q3.","Total new license and less license updates, including support revenues were $6.4 billion, up 4% in USD with software updates and support revenue of over $5 billion for the first time ever, reflecting continued excellent renewal rate and the strength of our installed base of customers. Total non-GAAP revenues for the company were $9.8 billion, up 1% from last year in constant currency and up 5% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 4% from last year in constant currency 9% in U.S. dollars. The operating margin was 44%, which was up from 43% last year. There were a couple of the one-time in and out in the expenses impacting this but basically the operating margin has now increased year-over-year for sixth consecutive quarters. And while I can\u2019t promise this will happen every quarter, I do expect that operating margin will continue to expand.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was materially lower than guidance at 16.1%, reflecting the impact from the new tax law, as well as other one-time benefits. The GAAP tax rate was 222%, reflecting the $6.9 billion tax charge related to the new tax law. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.83, up 20% in USD and up 15% in CD. The GAAP loss per share was $0.98, driven by the one-time charges related to the new tax law. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $15.2 billion, up 13% in U.S dollars and free cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.3 billion also up 13% in U.S. dollars.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $286 million and we expect that cloud CapEx spending will continue to be driven by our ARR and should we see higher than expected ARR growth, we\u2019d expect to see higher CapEx as investments as well. We now have more than $70 billion in cash and marketable securities, net of debt our cash balance is nearly $10 billion, the short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion, up 4% in constant currency. This quarter we repurchased nearly 81 million shares for a total of nearly $4 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased $143 million shares for a total $7 billion and we also paid out dividends of nearly $3.2 billion. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.","As we move to Q4 guidance, I want to remind you that we have a bit of a tough comparison as the last Q4 we beat our EPS guidance by $0.10. I will give you guidance for non-GAAP Q4 in U.S. dollars and also in constant currency. Assuming prior exchange rates, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue and $0.03 positive on earnings per share, so for Q4. Cloud revenues including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS are expected to grow 19% to 23% in USD, 17% to 21% in constant currency.","Total revenues are expected to grow from 1% to 3% in USD and negative 2% to 0% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to be between $0.92 and $0.95 and EPS in constant currency expected to be between $0.89 and $0.92. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of around 20%. The important thing for you to know is that for fiscal 2019, I expect the new tax law will translate for us to a tax rate of 19.5%. However, in any given quarter, we could see one-time tax events that will cause our actual tax rates to vary from our base rate, but I expected a normalizing for these one-time tax events our tax rate will average around 19.5%.","With that, I will turn it over to Mark for his comments.","Mark Hurd","Thanks, Safra. I'm just going to start with a few customer wins for the quarter and then make a couple of comments and I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. First, in ERP wins, Avis Budget Group, Barrick Gold, by the way also bought HCM at the same time, Baylor Scott & White Health, ERP and Fusion HCM; Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida Fusion ERP, Broadcom Fusion ERP; Caesars Entertainment, Fusion ERP and HCM; Dubai Ports, Fusion ERP; Eastern Line Technologies, Fusion ERP; Master Lock; MTM Group; William Morison Supermarket, all Fusion ERP; and HCM Arthur Gallagher; City of Memphis, again Dubai Ports; Grant Thornton; Henkel's McCoy, Marina Healthcare, also MTN brought HCM; National Oilwell Varco; Principle Financial Group; First Group, also William Morrison Supermarkets, and a really-really large U.S. bank who bought HCM from us which is one of the largest HCM transactions in ARRs that we have ever received.","With that a couple of comments on a quarter. Safra mentioned our revenue numbers up 6% with software and cloud revenue year-to-date, up 8% and operating income up 10% and EPS up 16%, up 20% in Q2. We talked a little bit about our ecosystem. Our app ecosystems year-to-date is up 12%, we continue to grow faster than the market. Less than 15% our apps customers have started to move their core apps to the cloud. Between customers that are partially moved and those not started yet, we have an enormous opportunity.","SaaS bookings ARR, ARR was roughly where I expected it to be in Q3 and with SaaS revenue now approaching $5 billion, I'll focus my comments on SaaS revenue as opposed to ARR. SaaS revenue up 24%, now over $4.6 billion run rate, ERP up 62% organically, overall ERP is now $1.5 billion annualized run rate. Fusion HCM was up 71%, that's a revenue number, doesn't include the bookings that I described a couple of minutes ago, verticals up 20%.","Now we move to tech. By the way on the verticals, I want to mention the 20% growth is compared up 110% last year. On our technical system, year-to-date our technology ecosystem is up at 6% with the database ecosystem also up at the same time roughly 6%. And again we\u2019re growing faster than the market. The fact is that we are taking market share and with autonomous database just beginning to show up in our pipeline, this will only strengthen our technology ecosystem growth.","As the infrastructure revenues up 28% with our NexGen PaaS infrastructure business growing 56% and we\u2019re already over $1.1 billion annualized run rate. A few highlights Oracle clouds, which includes database and service, up 34%. Public cloud infrastructure was actually up 142%, storage infrastructure up 82%, compute infrastructure up 121%, network infrastructure up 181%. Cloud revenue of 25% growth now at $6.3 billion annual run rate and 80% of our trailing 12 months software and cloud revenue that are now recurring in nature.","We're executing well on a big and growing pipeline. Our pipeline is at a record level and our year-to-date performance with top line growth at 60% USD and 16% EPS growth reflect our success. Looking forward for the full year, I expect our apps ecosystem as I said early in the year will grow around 10%. The tech ecosystem will grow around 5% and our EPS will be above 10%.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Larry Ellison","Thank you, Mark. Oracle was fully autonomous self-driving database is now available in the Oracle cloud. No other cloud provider has a fully automated database. One that automatically and immediately applies security of assets without requiring any scheduled downtime. Oracle's autonomous database features are absolutely unique.","There are more autonomous cloud services to come. Over the next few months, we expect to deliver autonomous analytics, autonomous mobility, autonomous application development and autonomous integration services. Oracle's new suite of autonomous PaaS services delivers an unprecedented level of automation and cost savings to our customers. Our highly automated suite of autonomous PaaS services reduces cost by reducing human labor and improves reliability and security by reducing human error. No other cloud provider has anything like it.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Larry. Holly if we could prepare the audience for Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow, Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow","I had a question around IaaS, PaaS, you saw an acceleration of growth which is greater. And Mark you talked in February when we talked about bring your own license as a factor that we need to consider. Can u talk a little bit about momentum you saw around IaaS, PaaS and bring your own licenses this quarter? Thank you.","Mark Hurd","Raimo, it\u2019s why I continue to try to focus here on the ecosystem number. I mean I think again without autonomous database frankly being GA at this point being generally available as Larry mentioned a bit in his comments. We grew the tech ecosystem 6% and it shows up in different categories. It shows up in license and again licenses today are not really on prem, licensees are now currency that you can use in the cloud or you can use it on prem, so licenses are now able to be used both ways.","And so we\u2019ve seen strong database, I\u2019d say strong database momentum in the context to being able to licenses and use in the cloud or on prem. By the way, we continue to see support grow in database at the same time. And you saw as I mentioned in my comments, growth in databases of service simultaneously 34% at all of the core next gen infrastructure categories grew in excess of 100%, storage is actually up 82% but compute up 121. We saw a good momentum. And again, the key for us so is that all tech eco system growth and I think with autonomous data base as we get a GA and build references, it\u2019s going to do nothing to get better.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan","Safra, I am looking at your SaaS guidance. Clearly, the business seems moderating into the 28%-ish type growth here. At this point, how do we get the margin leverage that you\u2019ve always talked about heading to 80%? Seems like on a year-over-year basis, you're showing an improvement but from 60%, 70% to 80% and what looks to be perhaps I am not putting words in your mouth, and it\u2019s basically your. So seems like a pretty big leap. And I just am curious to get your thoughts how the company manages to accomplish that goal? Thank you and that\u2019s it for me.","Safra Catz","So in running our SaaS business, it\u2019s really now getting to a scale and we\u2019re able to use the number of new technologies that we\u2019re rolling out through the business that is giving us a lot more capacity. So before we had to invest more for the same amount of users than we do now and so we\u2019ve got quite a lot of capacity improvement. And in fact we\u2019re not going to need to make too many more infrastructure investments into the SaaS business and yet handle a much larger install base. I don\u2019t know if anybody else wants to add to that\u2026","Mark Hurd","For example, as we fully diployed database multi-tenancy in our SaaS, let\u2019s say we double our capacity without spending one penny on hardware. We can help twice as many customers, twice as many transactions, twice as many users without spending one dollar. So those are technologies we can add that allow us to dramatically improve our SaaS market.","Larry Ellison","It\u2019s a straight math, so at our current SaaS business and you now play out we\u2019re spending $1.3 billion roughly speaking expense when you reverse engineer the gross margin. To Safra\u2019s point, we\u2019re just simply not having the dialog right now, dialog in the context of more expense. So if you just sell forward our bookings, you put $1 billion of revenue on the top, you\u2019re roughly at that number.","Kash Rangan","And Mark, I think you just said that only 15% of apps customers moved to the cloud, the other 85% is ahead of you. Couldn\u2019t the company grow again faster than SaaS given that you have a significant option and you had a few investments in it? Thank you.","Safra Catz","And to clarify, first thing you understand that that 15% have started, this is not 15% have moved all of their apps to the cloud, they just started so this is ton of room here\u2026","Larry Ellison","There's a lot wrapped into that quote that I put out there. And so let me try to unpack it a little bit. So in terms if you looked at core, meaning I have core e-business suite solutions and I replaced it with a cloud financials SaaS application. That percent of our user base has moved is below single digits. The less than 15% number we put out is the percent of our user base that has some cloud applications that they are now using. The percent of our user base that is in our pipeline now, is getting to be fairly extent, it's multiple 10% of our user base. And to your point when we convert a AI and traditional on premise application to SaaS, we typically get 3 times the revenue. The bulk of our bookings, the bulk of our revenue today is not from our user base.","In addition, one of the biggest users we have has now just migrated to the cloud and that would be us, Oracle. We have migrated the entire company to SaaS, that's an important point because we've moved really the suite of ERP capabilities that we had traditionally on premise now to cloud. So to your point the ability to accelerate that growth rate and I have not given this number what we could do by taking market share and all of the above, which we truly believe we are and we\u2019ll continue to do by just moving the user base does turn us into a very, very large SaaS business and to your point very well accelerates our growth rate.","Mark Hurd","I would like to add one thing to that is that we have some very high growth rate SaaS businesses like ERP and HCM, and we have some that we developed organically and we have some slower growth rate SaaS businesses that we've acquired many years ago. As the mix changes, you see all the growth is coming from Fusion ERP, Fusion HCM, NetSuite, it's also we expect after the quarter, this quarter -- great part of this quarter. As you see this shift to the higher growth rate SaaS services, I expect as our mix changes Fusion ERP, Fusion HCM and that's where it became a larger percentage of the total, again to growth mark, the math just says the growth rate should accelerate because of the mix change. I also think that's very important. Also the renewal rates, the renewal rates are much higher in the high growth SaaS services. So Fusion ERP, Fusion HCM, NetSuite have much higher renewal rates than we have in some of the older acquired SaaS products. So the combination of faster sales and higher renewal rates should dramatically increase our growth rate in our SaaS business. So you raised a simple question and you got a lot of guys in there\u2026","Kash Rangan","Analytical answer from Larry, thank you.","Larry Ellison","And the reason I say to you because it's important to understand we actually don\u2019t have a SaaS business that really grows at the rate we report SaaS. We have acquired businesses that are growing low single digits that we've had for a while, Fusion growing mid-60s with the potential to grow higher. We have NetSuite that we acquired that's growing mid to high-teens, but to Larry's point, we think it's going to start we're start to seeing the numbers grow faster and then vertical businesses that are growing roughly 20.","Mark Hurd","And as you see fusion becoming a more and more -- a larger and larger percentage of our total SaaS business then the change in mix you've got -- right now you would certainly have a very large fusion SaaS business growing at a high rate was then works those slower growing acquired businesses. So the reacceleration again to grow Mark it's just the matter of amount.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies.","John DiFucci","My question also I think has to do with the BYOL and I'm just trying to figure this out. So Mark from our field due diligence the flexibility offered customers would be BYOL as something they really appreciate. And it's certainly unique out there just no one else doing that and that's other vendors getting pressure to do, because you guys are doing it. I guess when I look at your results here and I see the cloud revenue been moderating pretty aggressively over the last couple of quarters, I buy into the whole ecosystem thing that you\u2019re talking about, it makes sense to me that BYOL will have that -- that would be a result. But I'm just to figure it out, because it looks pretty aggressive. And I'm getting pinged with emails too. And is that what it is or is it the large numbers too? And I am not sure if we\u2019re going to -- you said it accelerate a couple of times you used that word, and when I think of that whole ecosystem. Well that whole ecosystem is that what you guys think will start to happen at some point hopefully in the near future?","Mark Hurd","Well that was about 20 questions. So I'm going try to do my best to unpack it. I guess we were talking -- you started talking about database and then you introduced my comments on acceleration, which was mostly in apps and mostly around one portion of the apps ecosystem, which is SaaS. Let me go to tack answer, and Larry is going to want to chime in on this as well. The concept around BYOLs we don\u2019t want our customers to pay twice. So they get the opportunity to buy our license they can bring that license with them to the cloud and they can bring for example a database license to the cloud, and I'll take advantage of that by the appropriate infrastructure compute, storage and then with that perhaps some automation.","And if the customers choose to buy that way that will improve our license business in the way it's reported and it may have an effect on our cloud business and tech. And that's why I focus you on the ecosystem growth and the ability for us to grow faster. And then you have to add to it. We are just really bringing autonomous database to the market now. So that's going to go through its phases to bring the market. That and I told you this John over the past several quarters, our tech ecosystem without autonomous database, it's been taking a little bit of share. I think autonomous database is the most important thing we've announced in years. And I don\u2019t think the autonomous database -- I don't want to be sarcastic, because I don\u2019t want to be miss-print it, it will accelerate our tech ecosystem growth.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Adam Holt, MoffettNathanson.","Adam Holt","We've been very focused on here, your total new license or new software revenues which includes license revenue and cloud. There's been some movement about which has been a little bit better, which has been a little bit worse in the last couple of quarters. But how should we -- if we were to boil down all the comments you\u2019ve made on last couple of questions. Think about the mix between license growth and cloud on a go forward basis. Do you think that license growth could get close to breakeven? And then just for your Safra, you started to really buyback some stock, which we love this quarter. Could you give us maybe a sense for what we should be thinking about from a share count perspective going forward? Is this the new normal on now the buyback level? Thank you.","Safra Catz","Well, I don\u2019t usually tell you in advance how much I\u2019m going to buyback. So we did $4 billion in this quarter, seems like a reasonable amount to do. Haven\u2019t really -- don\u2019t really know what to tell you, because I don\u2019t usually give guidance from my buybacks, don\u2019t expect it to exceed that in the next quarter.","Adam Holt","And then the question about license mix versus cloud?","Larry Ellison","Well, there is no doubt that BYLO, when you're bringing your license to the cloud, encourage your customers to continue license purchases, it did give a buy more data base licenses, continue to buy data base options like multi-tenancy to buy data bases, data base options like real applications clustering and the like. So you will see -- and again our customers love the idea that once they make an investment in the license, they can use that license on premise or in the cloud, you can deploy it either place.","So where historically people have thought of our license business as our traditional on premise business that is -- in fact that is simply not the case. In fact, our license business is now more and more -- our licenses are being deployed in our cloud. By the way, it\u2019s not just -- they're not just being deployed in our cloud, our licenses are being deployed in the sales force and the SAP cloud and the Microsoft cloud, in the Amazon cloud. So again, our license business is not our legacy business, our license technology business not a legacy business. These licenses are going to be used and are being used more and more in modern cloud, not just the oracle cloud but our competitors clouds as well.","Mark Hurd","And I guess I would just say that, I know how badly everybody want to micro analyze every single number, and it\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried to focus you back on this ecosystem. We\u2019ve grown our software business year-to-date 8%. Some of that shows up in license. Some of that shows up in cloud. Now, we have a couple of drivers we\u2019ve talked about on the call. We\u2019ve a autonomous database, that\u2019s going to show up in both license and cloud, it\u2019s a fungible currency in the context of how -- to the earlier question, but I can now buy a license and I can bring it with me the cloud, it could show up in either buckets.","And again focusing on the overall ecosystem growth is important, the apps, we've talked about the user base and our ability to migrate to that user base, what effect will that have, that will show that apps support revenue goes down, SaaS revenue goes up. And so these things are going to go on simultaneously and again I'll say it one more time, I think trying to micro manage every line is probably the long way to look at the company, because we've got multiple drivers here, but they're all driving towards more overall software growth, some could come in cloud, some could come in license, but we're going to continue to gain share in both ecosystem segments.","Operator","Our next questions will come from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather, go ahead with your questions.","Heather Bellini","Mark, I know you don\u2019t want us to micro manage and fix data on license revenue, but you guys were seeing this segment shrink 10% to 15% over the last couple of years in '16, a big change in that performance over the last few quarters. One of the big questions that keeps coming up is what's driving the performance? And again, not trying to micro manage it, but there's a big debate of how much of it is just 12cR2 benefits and therefore maybe more one-time in nature versus maybe customers that are recommitting to Oracle ELAs, because of some of the things they see that you\u2019re doing on the innovation front. And I guess quite frankly, people are just trying to get a sense of how they think about growth in license as a result of all that over the course of the next year?","Mark Hurd","Well, I think my answer maybe yes. But I do think at the core of it is what we talked about earlier, bring your own license, gives now the customers instead of having to figure out how much I am going to buy here or there, I now get the ability to commit to a technology and we now -- we get the customer now have a currency that I can bring to whichever monument I want, whatever quantities I want. And it now gives the customer ultimate flexibility and that's what customers want. So BYOL was a concept has given our customers a lot of relief, you add to that the fact that we also move to universal credits, now gives the customer the opportunity to make even a cloud decision and reapply those credits across multiple cloud services. So this is a very -- Heather, I would say, a very customer friendly environment we created now in terms of the way they acquire our products and it\u2019s having an effect on the market.","Larry Ellison","Let me try to be clear about this as I could be. With BYOL, when someone brings their database to the cloud, some of that revenue goes into license and some of that revenue goes into cloud. Without BYOL, as we didn't have BYOL, and someone -- an Oracle customer went to the cloud, when 100% of revenue go to the cloud. So there's no question BYOL has lowered our cloud revenue and increased our license revenue.","Heather Bellini","And technology?","Larry Ellison","And technology.","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse.","Brad Zelnick","On autonomous database cloud, Larry or Mark perhaps can you talk about the impact that it would have on converting economics from on-perm, because it would seem I have to imagine you\u2019re going to get better multiples and the 3x that you've talked in the past as you generally get with regular data base and service?","Mark Hurd","Well, the amazing thing about the autonomous database is the only database on the planet that requires no human labor to administer the database. There are no DBAs tuning the system, there are no DBAs applying security patches, there are no DBAs backing up the system or recovering the system, it's all the done automatically. But with the bulk of the cost of running a data base is human labor, it's not buying the software, it's not buying the cloud surface, not buying the hardware or the cloud services or anything else, it's the human labor and we basically take that to zero. So there is huge value up by getting without this human labor.","By the way, it's not only cost savings so I think I said earlier in my opening remarks, we also eliminate human labor, you eliminate human error that gives you a much more secure system, nobody forgets to patch something. And your CEO ends up getting fired or on the front page of the newspaper, no one forgets to apply security patch and your data is stolen, that's all automated. So you have a much more secure system. You have a much more reliable system but you have to be willing to pay less, because human beings cost a lot of money and we've automated them out of the system. So we think this new autonomous database is again maybe the most important thing Oracle has ever done in terms of data management and we are the number one data management company on the planet right now, and have been for some time. We think this is a very big deal.","We think the bulk of our customers are going to move the autonomous data base. Now when we talk about migration, when you move from an on premise database to an autonomous data base, you press one button because you don\u2019t have to set up indexes or retune it or do anything else, your data automatically moves from on premise into our autonomous database in our cloud running on high performance year that pretty much guarantees to give you -- if you\u2019re running Exadata on premise it will run at the same speed. If you\u2019re not running at Exadata on premise, it will run 10 times faster by moving to the cloud. And it runs multiples of times faster than Amazon.","Now -- okay Oracle\u2019s got a faster database than Amazon it's no big surprise there. But the interesting thing Amazon charges by the minute and we charge by the minute is our prices are essentially the same or close enough. If we run 10 times faster, we are 1\/10 the cost of Amazon database and that's what it is. So I mean we\u2019ve been all the public benchmarks are, you can go and look at them, we're 1\/10 the cost. We automatically apply security patches, we eliminate human labor, it's a huge benefit to our customers to move to the autonomous database, it just went live a couple of weeks ago and we expect it\u2019s going to change the profile of our company forever.","Larry Ellison","Brad, to your question about the multiple, the answer to your question is yes.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler from Sanford Bernstein.","Mark Moerdler","Safra or Mark, software support with constant currency has been growing 2%, 3% year-over-year in the recent quarters, but only at 1% this quarter constant currency. Are you seeing increased cannibalization of the on premise business by your own Oracle cloud SaaS and PaaS or there other factors that are coming in?","Safra Catz","Actually, all you\u2019re really seeing is seasonality. If you\u2019re asking our cancellation rate way up, they are not. And in technology and especially with BYOL there\u2019s absolutely no reason. And in some cases for customer to cloud in the apps business, you will see cancellation. They are transacting not that large in the overall base. And so the overall cancellations for the company are actually the same. So they\u2019ve moved at all. And all you\u2019re seeing for the quarter is seasonality. I don\u2019t know Mark if you want to add anything\u2026","Mark Hurd","Everything she said is right and I\u2019d say nothing other than to say it\u2019s a little bit of a two different stories. So in data base support, data base support is growing I just want to make sure it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s growing materially, it\u2019s not growing 1%, it\u2019s growing more than 1%. Apps support the decline apps support decline is actually in our case is the bulk of our apps support is ERP that is the bulk of our application support. We want to migrate that to SaaS. So overtime, I have no issue if the ERP cancellation goes up as we migrate those customers I talked about earlier does that. And to Larry\u2019s earlier about point of about BYOL, BYOL very likely will have the impact of continuing growth in the tech, support part of our business and the applications now that I described is very much a byproduct of the migration of our support through to SaaS. Does that help?","Mark Moerdler","Just quick follow up. Is it the seasonality then so that Q3 is going to be weaker effectively and other quarters are better. Is that the way should be thinking models, can you give more detail?","Safra Catz","It just happens to be when we do the renewal. So I think you will see a return. And because you asked -- you compared a full year to one quarter and I think you will see that it recover I mean as Mark just said, on the tech side -- and remember also that some of it has to do with first year support. So since we\u2019re selling less apps licenses, we have less first year support associated with those licenses. And so -- and that\u2019s been for the past few years, so the amount floating is a little bit less, cancellation rates are the same and then we have some folks on the app side migrate. But that\u2019s it, still growing.","Larry Ellison","Let me just, real quickly. On the applications business, if someone moves in the e-business suite to the Oracle -- to Fusion ERP, they stop paying support, support goes down and a 100% of the Fusion ERP revenue is recognized in the cloud. This is in contrast to our tech business where if someone has an Oracle license or buys an additional Oracle license and then brings that license to the cloud, our license business stays the same or goes up. And part of the autonomous database that's running in the cloud is recognized as part of a license and support business.","And part of the revenue for the autonomous database is recognized as cloud revenue. So it's split. So these two businesses operate very differently. In our applications business, we're migrating people from an older generation of applications to a new generation of applications. We're actually changing from one product to another. We're changing from e-business suites to Fusion ERP, which is a different product. One runs on-premise, one runs in the cloud. Our tech business is very, very different. Oracle database on premise, you run the same Oracle database in the cloud. So we don\u2019t expect any shrinkage. As Mark said, we expect our license business, our new license business, our license and support business for tech, specifically database, to continue to grow even as people migrate those databases to the cloud.","Safra Catz","Yes, net-net tech really accelerates completely unchanged.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Kirk Materne, Evercore ISI.","Kirk Materne","Mark, when you look at the opportunities front in the ERP market, we've absolutely seen an inflection demand in CRM, I would say, HCM started over last couple of years. When you think about ERP, do you see an inflection on the horizon over the next 12 to 18 months? And can you just discuss maybe why and if we do see that, how do you see the competitive environment shaping up? Thanks.","Mark Hurd","Well one in ERP, we are the leading vendor in the world, and the number two company is hard for me to find. So let me start with that. So when I look at SaaS, there is no other company that has the ability to take customers to the cloud with a true SaaS offering. So full stop. Second, we have an inflection point clearly with our user base. So our user base as we\u2019ve tried to talk about today has only begun to move. And so just to the earlier question imagine what happens to our applications revenue, when we multiply three to one, actually our revenue doubles, our support revenue doubles, support revenue gets three times that revenue in the cloud. All I did in that math was talk about our user base. The bulk of what we book today in many cases is outside our user base.","Larry Ellison","Yes, someone else's user base.","Mark Hurd","We are gaining share from other companies. So I don\u2019t want you to walk away from this cold thinking I got it, their SaaS revenues really limited to their user base. I just talked about that in the context of one catalyst to our SaaS revenue, which is converting our existing customers just upgrading them to the latest version of ERP, which is SaaS. I truly believe the opportunity is materially bigger than that. Most of the ERP market doesn't sit with SAP by the way, doesn't sit with the -- the majority of the market doesn't sit with Oracle or SAP, it sits with this category called others.","And as others would like the opportunity to move to SaaS, we're in the best position in the world, worldwide to move those companies to SaaS. So moving our user base has a dramatic implication on our applications ecosystem. If we're successful to continue to take share at the same time, yes, it's a pretty exciting opportunity for us. And that's why you hear us talk about it so much.","Ken Bond","Thanks Mark. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to now turn the call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ken Bond","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Oracle\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Executive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison and CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.","As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements.

And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we will begin with some prepared remarks.","With that, I will turn the call over to Safra. Safra?","Safra Catz","Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks, Ken. I am actually offsite today, so hopefully this phone will work out. If you don\u2019t hear me, I may have to reconnect, but I do have obviously Ken Bond on the call and Corey West, our Chief Accounting Officer is also I think in the room with Larry and Mark.","I am going to focus today on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I will then review guidance for Q2, and I will actually give some guidance for the entire fiscal year, and then I will turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments. As you know, we didn\u2019t provide you a stellar guidance for Q1 given the high volatility in exchange rates we are seeing at the time. As it happened, Q1 currency headwinds were actually 2% worse than we expected. The currency impact for both total revenue and hardware revenue ended up being 9% and for software and cloud revenue was 8%. Now, we do get benefit on the expense side, but because many of our expenses are in the United States, we get a very small benefit and of course our expenses are significantly lower than our revenues, and so our operating income was actually impacted by 12 points.","Earnings per share was $0.06 lower, because of currency, $0.01 worse than we anticipated. With currency still volatile, we will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls, so we can have some measure of consistency and also share with you how we look at the business. We have also changed the presentation of our income statement to better reflect how we look at the company now that cloud has become a significant contributor to revenue. Our software business is really two parts of one business: the on-premise software business, which is steady and growing modestly and the cloud business that is in a high growth phase. We thought it made sense to show the components grouped together in our income statement to make it easier to see the progress we are making in the cloud.","The largest part is on-premise software revenues, which is made up of new software licenses plus software license updates and product support. On-premise software revenue was up 4% for the quarter to $5.8 billion. The largest component is software license updates and product support, which was up 8% for the quarter to $4.7 billion, with attach and renewal rates running at their usual high levels. We expect the on-premise software business to remain steady. Over the full year, I expect we will see modest growth comprised of continued growth in software support revenue that offsets any declines in new software license.","Moving on to cloud, we start with SaaS and PaaS and then add infrastructure as a service to report total cloud revenues, which were up 34%. Within the cloud business, we continued to see excellent momentum in SaaS and PaaS, with bookings growth of 165% this quarter on top of the 54% growth from Q1 of last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was $452 million, up 38% from last year. The triple-digit bookings growth that we have been experiencing will translate into significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue in the second half of the year. You can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 70% in U.S. dollars this quarter on top of the 100% growth last quarter. Also, the gross deferred revenue balance is now merely $1 billion and was up more than 100%. We have put the billings numbers up on the website for you to see in detail.","Our significant success in cloud bookings will not only help accelerate our revenue growth, but it will also benefit our margins and earnings over time. Cloud revenue, as you know, is recognized ratably while new license is recognized all upfront. This timing difference has the effect of lowering near-term operating margins and earnings per share, but over time will increase both. As our SaaS and PaaS bookings have continued to accelerate, capital expenditures for the quarter were higher compared to last year. The bulk of them are largely complete and you can see this in the $150 million sequential decline in CapEx this quarter. I expect CapEx for this year will be materially lower than last year as we utilize the investments that we have already made. We are well aware of the near-term impact to gross margins that this build-out cost has had on the cloud business, and I think that Q4 of last year marks the bottom for SaaS and PaaS gross margins.","Q1 cloud gross margins were up slightly on a sequential basis, and I think we will see another modest improvement in Q2. But as our cloud business scales up, we expect SaaS and PaaS gross margins will be around 60% by Q4 and then 80% over the next two years. The balance of our cloud revenues come from cloud infrastructure as a service, which was up 23% to $160 million. The gross margin in this business was up sequentially to a record 45%. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rate, along with significantly higher gross margins, we expect infrastructure as a service revenue will grow at a single-digit rate and maintain a steady margin profile over time. ","As I mentioned, there are two parts to our software business that can be looked at separately, but should really be considered together, the on-premise software business, which will grow modestly and serves as a tremendous base of loyal customers using our leading product. The SaaS and PaaS revenues will grow rapidly and will quickly become a significant contributor to revenues and profit as we help those same customers transform their businesses over time. In total, we will see growth in the total software business begin to increase this year as cloud revenue grows as a percentage of the total software business.","Finally, total hardware revenues grew 6%, which included hardware products revenue of $570 million and hardware support revenue of $559 million. Total revenue for the quarter was up 7% from last year to $8.5 billion.","Non-GAAP operating income was $3.5 billion and the operating margin was 41%. Sales and cloud investments, along with the integration of MICROS, each impacted operating margins negatively by about 1%. A non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter \u2013 the non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25%, which was 3.5 points higher than last year. The GAAP tax rate was 24.4%, which was 5 points higher than last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.53 in U.S. dollars and GAAP EPS was $0.40 in U.S. dollars. As I said earlier, both were $0.06 lower due to currency. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $11.8 billion.","We now have nearly $56 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $14 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.1 billion, up 10% in constant currency. This quarter, we repurchased more than 75 million shares for a total of $3 billion, up from our fiscal year \u201815 run rate of $2 billion a quarter. And given current market conditions, we expect to buy even more in Q2. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased more than 220 million shares for a total of $9.1 billion and paid out dividends of $2.4 billion for a total that is nearly 100% of free cash flow.","Now, to the guidance, as I mentioned, I am going to give you guidance for Q2 and then for the whole year. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition. And clearly, customers are migrating to the Oracle cloud. Over time, we expect the cloud will result in more revenue and profit for Oracle as we take share from legacy on-premise competitors, other cloud competitors who are limited to point solutions and the labor suppliers who can\u2019t possibly offer what we have already built. Of course, I am seeing many of the same financial news reports that all of you are about the whole world. And so I think it is still best to be prudent here. Additionally, we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates and significant currency headwinds.","I am going to give you constant currency guidance, but if exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see a currency headwind of about 6% on revenue and $0.05 on earnings per share. But again, it could be significantly worse. Maybe if we are lucky, it could be a little bit better. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. So, here it goes.","SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 36% to 40%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 5% to 9%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow from 0% to 2%. Total revenue is expected to range from a negative 2% to a positive 1%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. Now, this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being different. Looking further out, we expect to see a material acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue. As a result, I am providing full fiscal year guidance for some key items. As before, my guidance on the full year is in constant currency.","SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow around 50%. On-premise software is expected to grow approximately 1%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 3% and 4%. Finally, SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to materially improve in the second half and exit the year at around 60%.","With that, I will turn it over to Larry and Mark for their comments.","Larry Ellison","Thank you, Safra. This is Larry. Over the last three years, we have been in the startup phase of our cloud business. We have developed services at all four layers of the cloud, a complete set of enterprise SaaS applications, plus our database and middleware platform services, plus compute and storage infrastructure services, and an expanding set of data systems.","We have deployed those cloud services in 19 data centers and 14 countries around the world. During this startup phase of our cloud business, we have increased our data center service delivery capacity from 0.5 megawatt to 45 megawatts. That\u2019s a 90x, not 90%, a 90x increase in our data center capacity in three years. We have installed over 40,000 physical devices, a 100,000 virtual machines and over 8 petabytes of storage. We now have in place the physical infrastructure to dramatically expand our cloud customer base. We are entering the rapid growth, scale-out phase of our cloud business. We are adding thousands of new SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and data customers to our existing data centers. With all that customer growth on top of our existing infrastructure, we expect that our cloud margins will double from 40% to 80% over the next two years.","Mark, it\u2019s your turn to tell everybody about all those great customer adds we had during Q1.","Mark Hurd","Thanks. By the process of elimination, this is Mark actually speaking. So, I thought I would do two things right to the Larry\u2019s point, tell you about some wins, but also give you some facts about the quarter. Revenue grew 38% year-on-year, 8% quarter-on-quarter. Billings grew 70%, again growing much faster than Salesforce and Workday. Bookings were $191 million, a 165% growth. And like I always do, I want to tell you the number of customers we added. We added 612 new SaaS customers in the quarter, brand new logos. 616 expanded their SaaS business with us in the quarter. In HCM, it was 166 new customers, more than double what Workday added. In CX, 280 customers. In ERP EPM, it was 200 customers, double last year. That is also more than Workday\u2019s lifetime sales. We now have 1,350 customers in our installed base. More than 300 are already live, including 100 that went live in just Q1.","What\u2019s taken Workday eight quarters to do, we did in one quarter. We never see SAP. PaaS, we added 800 new PaaS customers in the quarter, 2,500 in just two quarters. Bookings over $65 million. Now, I think we have a shot in Q2 to book more PaaS than we actually did in Q4. I think we have a shot. That\u2019s how fast we see our pipeline growing in PaaS.","I am going to wrap up and then I am going to read you some news, but I just want to connect a few dots between what Safra and Larry described on the Oracle SaaS, PaaS cloud. We are currently at a $1.8 billion run-rate in revenue. If you include IaaS, it\u2019s $2.4 billion. We will book between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in SaaS, PaaS ARR in the fiscal year. Gross deferred revenue has grown from $475 million to nearly $1 billion in the year. Billings are growing 70%. Gross margins are headed to 80%. SaaS, PaaS will be a very large and very profitable business for Oracle.","Now, in addition, I just want to give you some brands that we got in the quarter just so you have a feeling for who these \u2013 all these people are that are buying solutions from us. So, first let me hit HCM. A few wins, CEMEX, they are an Australia fusion HCM. We replaced Workday at CEMEX in the quarter; Cypress Semiconductor; GDF Suez; Limited Brands; Nationwide Insurance; Restoration Hardware; Rutgers University. We expanded our HCM clouds at Omnicare, the Navy, Westpac Bank. In ERP EPM, Athena Health, Chicago Sun-Times, these are all new customers by the way. Fox Home Entertainment, U.S. Department of Energy, LendingClub Corp, Lenovo, LG Electronics, Rutgers University. By the way, you will hear a few names twice, which is because they bought multiple pillars at the same time.","In sales service cloud, Fox Home Entertainment, Royal Mail, Sallie Mae, SIRIUS XM, Toshiba Medical, Wesfarmers, expansions at Cigna, Motorola, Nikon, Polycom, Virgin Atlantic, Westpac. In our marketing cloud, Aer Lingus, General Mills, JeansWest, Telstra, Verizon, expansions at Booz Allen Hamilton, Forever 21, National Instruments, NetApp, Pier 1 Imports, Public Broadcasting System, TaylorMade Golf Company, Time Inc. I am going to stop, but I wanted to give you a flavor for not just the number of customers but the quality of brands that are buying from us at the same time.","Ken, with that, let\u2019s take whatever questions anybody has got.","Ken Bond","Great. Thank you very much, Mark. Operator, if you could please instruct the audience for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Phil Winslow","Hi, thanks guys and congrats on another great quarter in the cloud with that 70% billings growth and also thank you for the commentary on the gross margin there going forward, that was really helpful. I just wanted to double click on the cloud for a little bit, SaaS and PaaS, Mark you gave us some commentary on the PaaS side for Q2. And obviously, it sounds like that\u2019s ramping. But if you focus in in on the SaaS side, what trends are you seeing there, HCM versus financials, maybe trends on adoption you can see there and go-live, any sort of color would be great?","Mark Hurd","Well, listen, I hate to compare our pillars, because individually, they are all doing quite well. So, I don\u2019t want to compare them against each other. But it\u2019s clear to me the ramp in ERP is its strength. I mean, when you look at the number of customers we\u2019d be able to bring on board, remember, this is really our fifth quarter really in the business in the cloud. When you think of 1,350 customers that are now under contract, I think it\u2019s \u2013 Larry can do this better than I can, but in roughly 23, 24 years, we are sort of already at, I don\u2019t know, 10% of the on-prem base. It\u2019s now in the cloud in terms of just sheer number of companies, and our pipeline is just full. So, ERP, we are highly differentiated and we are way ahead of wherever it is you think is number two, and it\u2019s extreme \u2013 I think it\u2019s a combination, Philip, what we have talked about before. It\u2019s \u2013 our products have done nothing, but gets better and better and better. We are on now Release 10. Release 11 is now coming out, so our products have gotten better. Our people \u2013 we have got more people. They are better trained and we just have now a lot of go-lives and a lot of references and that\u2019s true across each one of our pillars, Phil.","Larry Ellison","Yes. I would like to add a couple of things. One is that the products that we have are being translated into more and more languages and updated for statutory compliance in more and more countries. So, there are more markets we can sell them into. And we are adding supply chain and manufacturing with this release in ERP. So, we have \u2013 there is really nobody with a comprehensive suite of enterprise software products. And now \u2013 and we are able to sell it internationally. So, we think we have a huge advantage. I don\u2019t know who you consider the competitor in ERP. Again, every quarter, I mean, if Workday is the competitor, every quarter, we sell \u2013 Q1 is our smallest quarter and we sold more deals in Q1 than Workday\u2019s sold ERP deals, and Workday has sold since their company began. We view that every single quarter. So, our relative strength, I think as Mark said, I think all of our pillars are doing well. But on a relative basis, whoever is number two in ERP, they are a long, long way behind. And by the way, ERP is the largest segment of application in the cloud. That will be just like \u2013 people \u2013 SAP was the leading on-premise application software vendor in the last generation of applications, because they were number one in ERP. The leading vendor \u2013 applications vendor in the cloud this generation will also be whoever wins the ERP work.","Mark Hurd","Yes, Phil, we have fallen into the trap that I didn\u2019t want to fall into as comparing pillars and you can tell how excited we are about ERP. But frankly, if you were in our marketing cloud business, you would be really excited. When you start running off the names that I run off in marketing cloud, we are highly differentiated and we are winning. We have done well in B2C. We have done well in B2B. You add what\u2019s now occurred in service. I mean, we are starting to see again significant service growth in our service cloud and our sales cloud, while again small and very different than ERP, up against a big competitor. Our service cloud is showing very strong growth. And so if you looked in each of our pillars, we have added on some really cool stuff here, just while I am on a roll here. We have added on a very cool data as a service business. So, our data as a service business, what\u2019s come to us with our BlueKai acquisition and our Datalogix acquisition is now another component of our marketing cloud, and that had tremendous performance in Q1. So, it\u2019s really a story across sort of all of our pillars. ERP is of course exciting, because to Larry\u2019s point, it\u2019s the biggest pillar in terms of total available market and one that has a lot of pull. It pulls a lot of HCM. When we win an ERP, our connect rate of HCM to ERP is pretty high and growing, but the success is broad-based and that\u2019s sort of the enthusiasm you hear keep coming from us as we talk about what we see happening across our SaaS business.","Ken Bond","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.","Michael Turits","Hey, guys. I wanted to switch over from apps to database. I want to ask you broadly. I know the 12c is being adopted faster than 11. Can you give us an update on the adoption of multi-tenancy and in-memory options? And from a cloud perspective, how much traction you are getting with the SaaS providers and maybe we could say for database as a service, how is that working as part of the broader platform as a service offering?","Larry Ellison","Okay. So, we have never had any of our options for the database, have an update as fast as we are seeing with multi-tenancy and in-memory. We never experienced people that want to get these two particular pictures turned on. And this is in our on-premise customer base. As you know, most major SaaS companies run Oracle. SAP runs Ariba on Oracle. SAP runs SuccessFactors on Oracle. SAP runs Concur on Oracle. NetSuite runs on Oracle. Salesforce runs on Oracle. And all of them are able to deliver more efficiency in terms of query processing by turning on the in-memory feature. All of them are able to, by more efficiency they use less hardware and they deliver better performance. So, they lower their internal cost and deliver their performance. All of them are much more efficient in the usage of hardware resource by turning on multi-tenancy. Now, these guys have multi-tenancy built into their application. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t layer things. So, they have multi-tenancy at the application level, multi-tenancy at the database level, and then multi-tenancy at the operating system level, which is called VM. All of those things kind of conspire together to more efficiently utilize your hardware, provide better recovery in security systems. So, we see the demand from our traditional on-prem customers and the new generation of cloud customers for these two new options unlike anything that\u2019s out before.","Ken Bond","Next question, fine Michael, go ahead, Michael.","Michael Turits","Yes, just if I was curious as to two things. One is how is database as a service fitting in with your broader platform as a service offering? And is there any slowing of database and expectations of Release 2 for 12c?","Larry Ellison","I don\u2019t think \u2013 as you know, if you buy the database now and you get all \u2013 and you maintain support, you get all the subsequent versions. So, no, I don\u2019t think there is any slowing. However, we are encouraging people to run all their dev tests, all their development and test in our cloud as opposed to on-prem, which does imply a shift from database on-prem to our database service. That\u2019s what we want them to do. We think that lowers their cost and raises our revenue and profits. We think it works very well for us. So, you really have to look at those two businesses added together. And I think that\u2019s what Safra is saying in her presentation. You can\u2019t look at database on-premise separately from PaaS, to database as a service. It\u2019s really that some of those that have to grow. Some of those have to grow at the top line level and that some of those have to grow in terms of profitability. And we see that happening right now. So, we think PaaS, yes, some people will like to buy database as a service as opposed to running dev test on-prem, but we think that\u2019s a good thing. We think we \u2013 they get a more efficient service. They spend less. We get more.","Mark Hurd","I think one thing Michael that I would add to it is that from a customer\u2019s point of view, these decisions aren\u2019t necessarily binary. I mean, that I am going to run database as a service as opposed to database on-prem. What the major differentiation for Oracle is nobody else can do is that we can actually do this on-premise for you and do it for you in the cloud. And we can do it at the exact same time. We can deliver to you a capability in the cloud and we can go over the exact same capability to you on-premise and move those workloads back and forth, whether that\u2019s database as a service, some dev test and then dev test in our cloud into your data center to run your production applications. It\u2019s important to understand this is a huge differentiator that only this company can deliver. We are not just cloud. We have a fantastic hyper growth cloud with on-prem capability that nobody else brings the two together like Oracle.","Larry Ellison","For example, we have Exadata as a service that we are rolling out at Oracle OpenWorld. So, we have Exadata as a service in our cloud. And we obviously sell Exadata as a machine to run on-premise, the most modern way, most cost effective way to run our database. So, you can run part of your database workload on-prem on that Exadata platform. Part of that database workload in our cloud on that Exadata platform and our management tool. When you are running your data center assets and our cloud assets, the person who is running that thinks that\u2019s one pool of assets with one set of management tool that allow you to run your Exadatas and the Exadatas in the cloud together, move data back and forth, move workloads back and forth. There is \u2013 this coexistence of cloud and on-premise computing is going to be a decades-long process, if not forever. But during this long period of coexistence, we think it\u2019s very important to have absolute compatibility between on-prem and in the cloud. And Mark makes \u2013 Mark points out our biggest differentiator in this business. We have great on-premise technology with some of our fancy appliances like Exadata, Big Data Appliance, Exalogic and go on and on and we offer those that same advanced technology in the cloud and we lace it together and make it look like one set of assets.","Mark Hurd","At the risk of over-answering your question, I am going to stop here. By the time we get to OpenWorld and Larry presents on Sunday night, we will have now fundamentally all of our software assets redone for the modern cloud. So, the ability to do what Larry said is not something that\u2019s 5 years away, 4 years away, 3 years away, we can start delivering Exadata as a service and these are opportunities that Larry described now.","Michael Turits","Thanks, Larry. Thanks Mark.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Mike. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Thank you so much. This is a question for Mark. I was just wondering if you could share with us, if you were to characterize what inning we are in of the SaaS transition if you could kind of help us think about that? And also when do you think we start to see \u2013 I know you mentioned some commentary about momentum in PaaS, but when do we see that become a material part of that SaaS, PaaS revenue line? And then I guess the follow-up to that would just be, you touched I think on Phil\u2019s question about the SaaS competitive dynamics, but can you walk us through how you are thinking about the competitive environment for PaaS as well? Thank you.","Mark Hurd","Okay. So, that was one of those. Let me give you a question, six parts type thing.","Heather Bellini","Exactly.","Mark Hurd","Heather, I will try. So, in the baseball analogy, I don\u2019t know, top of the first. We are in the very beginning stages. It depends a little which pillar we are talking about.","Heather Bellini","Well, for SaaS first and then for PaaS.","Mark Hurd","Server SaaS and I am talking about SaaS and I am talking across each pillar. I mean, the ERP opportunity has just started. Now, what happens that we are ramping incredibly fast. I think if I had said four quarters ago and said, hey, I think we will have 1,350 customers signed up to run in our cloud in about four or five quarters, you should go seek some help, because it won\u2019t happen like that. It has. That said, we are only now getting to the point, Heather, where we actually have all the references required, we have got our sales force scaled. I think we are in \u2013 and by the way, to Larry\u2019s point, I thought Larry made a great point. We are releasing a lot of new products. It may not \u2013 you may not come across that way, but with the next release, we now release products that are localized for many, many more countries, markets that frankly we just weren\u2019t in given six months ago in addition to the fact that an ERP we are releasing supply chain manufacturing now. So, we can now look after manufacturers as well. I made a comment about what we have added now in marketing in terms of our data cloud that we have now supplemented our marketing cloud with. We have new releases coming in service cloud. So, there is just a whole suite of products.","I would tell you top of the first, this is a multiyear long, long gain. We just happen to be extremely well positioned as the only one who has a suite of products and the only one that has best-of-breed products that are in a suite that can then combine it, to your point, with a PaaS capability that allows you to extend those applications without destroying the upgradeability of the application suite that you bought. So, it\u2019s great \u2013 our pipeline a year ago at SAM, I made a statement about the size of our pipeline. Probably nobody remembers it because it seems like a long time ago. Think about since then, our pipeline in SaaS, this is our annualized pipeline, has more than doubled, more than doubled off of a really big number. So, now you have got a pipeline scale. And the great thing is I know nobody thought it at the time. You have seen it now come through the pipeline and turn into bookings. And my expectations are very favorable as I have indicated about what SaaS bookings are going to look like for the rest of the year.","Ken Bond","Next question, please. Operator?","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital.","Ross MacMillan","Thanks a lot. Safra, I would like to drill into your comments on cloud gross margins and the expansion that you are expecting as we exit this year and look further out, pretty significant. And I guess the question is, is that really just driven by revenue scale? And is there a certain level of revenue scale in PaaS and SaaS that you need to achieve the target 80% in two years? Thanks.","Safra Catz","Okay. Well, it\u2019s actually going to hit in many ways on \u2013 in both revenue and expenses, because we have, as Larry explained, we have invested immense resources in building up our infrastructure. And as I mentioned on the call, our capital expenditure numbers have been very, very large as compared to what we are used to historically. And so we have put out those expenditures and we have started to amortize them. However, in the second half of this year, our capital expenditure numbers are going to be significantly lower, even significantly lower than even this quarter. You will see, I believe, at least another $100 million decline and then a continuing reduction. And the reason that matters is because what you will simultaneously be seeing is a massive amount of revenue which can finally be recognized. That is going to start in true earnest in the second half of the year, in Q3 and Q4 while simultaneously we will not be adding capacity. In fact, we will be spending less than we historically have spent on capital expenditures. We will be back to numbers that you would have looked at and seen in fiscal year \u201814. So, as expenses \u2013 and in addition, you understand, it\u2019s not only capital expenditures, it\u2019s all sorts of staffing and labor and tools, etcetera that have all been put in place. And we will not have to add them while the revenue is going to start flowing both out of the balance sheet, which is extremely apparent and you will be able to look at it in detail in the Q filing that we should do either at the end of this week or at the beginning of next and in our new sales. So, that\u2019s what it is. Revenue up, expenses stabilizing, and actually going down.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Safra. Next question.","Ross MacMillan","Thanks, Safra.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America.","Kash Rangan","Hey, thanks for taking my questions. My question is for Safra. Safra, how do you view the investment trade-off between the license business and the cloud business, because I think it\u2019s pretty apparent to us that one business has higher growth but lower margin? And when I parse your comments, it looks like CapEx is going to come down for the cloud business. So, are we at a point where the license business has trough and it\u2019s not going to decline anymore and that the profit growth out of the cloud business will start to add on? And that this year, in some sense it\u2019s the trough in your operating profits. A lot of the other software companies have been attempting to make this model transition, have been resetting their numbers for the license business by their own volition is coming down troughing and then the cloud business starts to pick up. So, where is \u2013 how should we look at Oracle in the context of a shift that\u2019s happening? Thank you very much.","Safra Catz","Sure. Well, first of all, the way we look at the on-premise business and I am not sure I am entirely understanding your question, but there is the new licenses, and of course, our massive installed base of license subscription. We look at that as the on-premise business. And that business is steady, growing slightly, very profitable of course, because we are at scale. We still make a lot of investments in that area. However, you should be thinking about the cloud business as another way for us to offer that same software to our customers in a different way, where we are actually hosting the software and doing a lot more of the labor. And because we will have economies of scale, they could not possibly have as individual customers. So, really it\u2019s all one business. However, more and more, when we provide it as a cloud provider, we are providing the hardware, the software, the labor all in a package and that gives us a significantly larger amount of their wallet share. Simultaneously, the customer is actually spending less overall, because we can supply this package in a very economical way. But also since all of it is our own differentiated intellectual property, we can do it at much higher margins. And the more scale we get, the more profitable we will be. We have been in a startup mode in this whole area. We have done it basically within our profit envelope. However, this extremely quick transition, which you are truly seeing the pivot in this fiscal year, which is the reason we are breaking it out for you and really breaking our own rules of guidance where we are actually giving you a full year guidance so you can see how we are coming out of it.","Kash Rangan","So Safra, I want to conclude this and take this the financial implication, could this year be the operating profits? And then as a result of the nice investments, we start to see the operating income of the company start to grow from next fiscal year?","Safra Catz","I believe it is, yes, absolutely.","Kash Rangan","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Ken Bond","Next question please.","Kash Rangan","That\u2019s it for me.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill","Thanks. Mark and Safra, I think your investors understand this transition to cloud is going to take time, but the ramp is definitely taking longer than some of the financial forecasts you have given the last several quarters. And now you are calling for a weaker first half, but a better second half. I guess just what\u2019s underpinning your confidence that this ramp is going to happen in the back half?","Safra Catz","Frankly, it\u2019s not possible that it does not happen. These are \u2013 there is a lot of revenue on the balance sheet that will be recognized in the second half. It cannot be. It is appropriate to do that to the extent that in some cases, customers have been through their promotion period and also we just have booked so many contracts that are ramping up and billing and starting to bill, there really is \u2013 it\u2019s not avoidable. It is inevitable that Q2 is \u2013 that have to \u2013 second half is going to be very significant.","Mark Hurd","Brent, I just to add to it, first, we have the contract. Second, when you look at the balance sheet, you see the $1 billion of deferred, you can just do the math. So, we have the contracts and so it\u2019s just not, to Safra\u2019s point, it\u2019s not a guessing game.","Brent Thill","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Just to follow-up on the license guide, Safra, for the full year, you mentioned that, that will stabilize versus what you saw last year in terms of the decline. What was giving you the confidence there that, that will stabilize versus what you saw last year?","Mark Hurd","Well, I have my forecast. I have my closure rates that I am expecting. Remember, it\u2019s not new license only, it is a software. It is our software installed base with extremely high renewal rates that continues when we sell new licenses in addition to our base then we get additional growth. Again, it\u2019s \u2013 the only question is what level is decline we have in new license. We are being conservative. There is always risk that it won\u2019t be. But again, new license has gotten to be a smaller percentage of that whole on-premise business. And we are doing the same type of estimating that we do, do our best with all the data we have.","Brent Thill","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Safra, I wanted to stay on that point a little bit. So, if you look at the license number that we see at the moment, it was like last quarter was minus 10, this quarter was minus 9. And obviously with the cloud transition going on which impacts you negatively, can you talk a little bit about other factors that might impact us and we all heard about the issues around China, etcetera. So, maybe talk a little bit about what you see in the different regions that might impact that growth number as well? Thank you.","Safra Catz","Sure. I mean, look, there is no question that internationally, there is quite a lot of chaos to say the least. And the currency impact of countries that we have been doing very well is not helping. Even though my Latin America team is executing out of the park in constant currency, the devaluation of the different currencies in LAD, for example, are very negatively affecting my U.S. dollar results. Obviously, there is quite a lot going on in Europe in different parts and both that and currency. I feel that Asia-Pacific for us is actually stabilizing. China is not a big country for us historically. So, that\u2019s less of an issue for us directly, but the countries and businesses that are impacted by the China trade like Australia, Canada, Brazil, those can be at risk. So, I am not an economist. I \u2013 these things are impacted by especially transactional business like new hardware sales or new license sales are impacted by these regional issues. But in general, on-premise software, which is dominated by software updates and product support customers renew because that is software that is very important to them and is doing the most important work in their companies, governments or non-profits. And so that is obviously very, very steady for us and continues to do well, but the transactional business is at the same potential risk. However, the cloud momentum is so strong that overall, we expect very significant growth and that is from contracts already in hand in most cases.","Raimo Lenschow","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","And our final question today will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies.","John DiFucci","Thank you. Safra, I would like to better understand something I thought I understood, but it\u2019s how exactly your bookings of SaaS and PaaS convert to revenue. For instance, bookings \u2013 PaaS and SaaS bookings last quarter were somewhere around $425 million. And if you assume this was signed towards the end of the quarter, I would expect cloud revenue SaaS and PaaS to grow sequentially by about a quarter of this number or by about $100 million, but it only grew by little more than $30 million. And I am just curious is PaaS, because it sounded like PaaS was like a real big quarter last quarter. Is the revenue recognition like SaaS, where it\u2019s recognized immediately in the same amount over like the three years of the contract or is it recognized a little differently where it\u2019s recognized as the customer consumes the technology? What am I missing here?","Safra Catz","You are actually not missing anything. You are exactly asking the right question. And unfortunately, the answer is it depends because depending on what kind of agreement the customer signed, they may have signed a metered agreement, which means it will be recognized as they use it. However, it will expire after a certain time period if they don\u2019t use it, when that is what we call metered. On the other hand, to the extent that they have a subscription, then let\u2019s say, one month\u2019s worth is recognized and then another month whether they use it or not. So, SaaS is almost always a subscription. PaaS can be either metered or a subscription. And so it is recognized differently and that\u2019s it.","John DiFucci","That actually makes a ton of sense. It\u2019s really helpful. But just one quick question follow-up to that, once if it\u2019s a metered PaaS deal and it expires, at that time, given the contract terms, the customers, does that you recognize anything remaining on that contract at the time of expiration?","Safra Catz","If it\u2019s expired, let\u2019s say, they bought $100,000 metered, you could almost consider it a gift card. If they use it all on the first day, I book it alright then. If they don\u2019t use it at all, I book it when it expires.","John DiFucci","Perfect. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks, Safra.","Mark Hurd","John, I will just add on SaaS, just to make sure you understand what\u2019s happening as we get to Q3, because Safra talked about Q3 and Q4. So, when we entered the SaaS market, we had a series of promotions, meaning that you would get some time to install. Our strategy was to give you an incentive when you bought that you had time to then implement and that promotion had a certain amount of time associated with it. Obviously, that was part of building up our reference base. Secondly, as we built up our reference base, we actually shortened the promotions. So, that actually \u2013 it actually went down by half the period of time. The two sets of promotions over the last couple of years, just by coincidence, coterminously end at the end of Q2. So, the percent of the bookings that were on those types of promotions both end at the end of Q2 of this fiscal year. So, that\u2019s why one of the reasons in SaaS, why you will see a jump in revenue that also will not be explained by bookings. So, again, while you said I couldn\u2019t explain Q2 to bookings, you won\u2019t be able to explain exactly the alignment of the increase in revenue based on the bookings either, because underneath it is this promotions. So, there are multiple dimensions here. There is just promotion dimension. There is the dimension that Safra described, which is about 1% of our PaaS is metered and 1% of our PaaS is subscription. So, there is a couple of different ways you can consume the PaaS. In addition to it, it takes a certain amount of time for us in some cases, I told you about a win, for example, last quarter at HSBC, a very large ERP in the cloud win. It will take us several months to fully provision that ERP for HSBC. So, it\u2019s those factors together that formulate the conversion of the booking to revenue.","John DiFucci","But just to be clear, Mark\u2026","Mark Hurd","And one more time why we are so confident? We have the contracts. We know the expiration of the promotions. We know exactly when the PaaS expires. And in addition, you see all of that as it relates to deferred on the balance sheet.","John DiFucci","Great. And just to be clear, Mark, once you start \u2013 you are really giving in the SaaS, the SaaS examples you gave, it\u2019s still once it starts to be \u2013 you may delay the beginning when you should begin to start recognizing the revenue, but it will be recognized as a subscription so evenly over the term?","Mark Hurd","Yes, it is. It\u2019s a very important tool, John, because instead of discounting, you actually renew against a higher rate and the promotion is basically a window by which you have time to get installed. And it\u2019s a very important tool as you are building up a reference base. And that\u2019s what we have done. Now, the promotions over that period of time, call that a two or three-year period of time have declined and declined and declined. So, the amount of promotion that\u2019s available in our SaaS portfolio today is materially smaller than it was two years ago and materially smaller than it was a year ago. And so what happens is we think the confluence of events really come together in Q3, which is where you see this pop in our revenue. And then from there, you will begin to see a more ratable alignment of bookings to revenue sort of save the one point about the PaaS consumption that Safra was making.","John DiFucci","Okay, great. That\u2019s all really helpful. Thanks Mark.","Mark Hurd","Thanks, John.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Mark. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department for follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you.

Now, I\u2019d like to turn today\u2019s call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Victoria. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to Oracle\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations Web site.","On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect those forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today.","As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and any other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll first go over Q2 before moving on to guidance. I\u2019ll then turn the call over to Mark and then Larry for their comments.","Let me start by summarizing that Q2 was another solid quarter. Constant currency revenue growth was slightly above the high end of my guidance, and constant currency earnings per share was $0.02 above the high end of my guidance. As in prior quarters, I\u2019ll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise.","Total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $6.6 billion, up 5% in constant currency. This accounted for nearly 70% of the total company revenues and most of it is recurring revenues. GAAP applications total revenues were $2.8 billion, up 7% and GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenues were $5 billion, up 1%. Mark will go over more detailed revenue and bookings numbers in a moment.","The gross margins for cloud services and license support was 86%, essentially the same as last year with continuing improvement in SaaS gross margins, stability in software support gross margins and continued investments in Oracle cloud infrastructure. As we continue to scale and grow our cloud business, I expect our gross margins will ultimately go higher. Total revenues for the quarter were $9.6 billion, up 2% from last year.","Non-GAAP operating income was $4.1 billion unchanged from last year and the operating margin was 43%, the same as last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.6%, slightly below our base rate of 20% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.80, and up 19% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 15.9% and GAAP EPS was $0.61, up 22% in constant currency.","Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $15.2 billion. Q2 operating cash flow was in fact negatively impacted by our first installment payment over $600 million on the one-time transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Over the last four quarters, capital expenditures were $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $13.8 billion, up 10% in U.S. dollars. We now have more than $49 billion in cash and marketable securities.","The short term deferred revenue balance is $8.2 billion and that\u2019s up 6% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligations or what we\u2019ll refer to as contract backlog will be in the 10-Q and is now $30.1 billion, of which approximately 62% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders through acquisitions, internal investments and the return of capital with stock repurchases and dividends. This quarter, we repurchased $203 million shares for a total of $10 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 602 million shares and reduced the absolute shares outstanding by over 12%. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.","Turning to currency, I expect the strengthening U.S. dollar will increase the currency headwind to 4% for Q3, and a $0.03 headwind to earnings per share. So for Q3, my guidance is total revenues are expected to grow 2% to 4% in constant currency. I continue to expect that second half revenue growth will be higher and we remain committed to delivering a higher constant currency growth rate for all of fiscal 2019 when compared to last fiscal year.","You may remember that last year's Q3 EPS included some onetime events, which I called out at the time which helped by about $0.03 last year. In addition, my EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 20%, which is nearly 4 points higher than last year, because last year's tax rate was a catch up quarter for the new tax law. Certainly, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for Q3 to vary from the base rate. But I expect that a normalizing for these one-time events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2019.","With all that for this quarter, non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 7% to 9%, and be between $0.86 and $0.88 and non-GAAP EPS for Q3 in U.S. dollars is expected to grow between 3% to 5%, and be between $0.83 and $0.85. And while my double digit constant currency EPS growth guidance for fiscal year '19 has not been a specific number, I can tell you that internally I have in fact raised my fiscal year '19 constant currency EPS growth rate estimates.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.","Mark Hurd","Thank you, Safra. Solid quarter for us from top to bottom; total revenue was up 2%, constant currency with cloud service and license support up 5% and of course EPS up 19%. It\u2019s a seventh consecutive quarter we've reported double-digit EPS growth. Apps had a spectacular quarter with great momentum growing 7% for the overall ecosystem over $11 billion in trailing 12 month and 91% of that is now recurring revenue.","We continue to grow revenues faster than the market, and we have an enormous opportunity ahead of us, particularly ERP as well as HCM. To Safra's point about the numbers, let me give you some numbers about our SaaS business. Overall, ERP and HCM now have annualized SaaS revenue of $2.6 billion, up mid-20s percent. Fusion apps revenue growth was 34%; fusion ERP revenue growth was 44% organically; NetSuite ERP revenue growth 25%; vertical revenue and applications grew 35%; annualized revenue now up $800 million.","In terms of SaaS bookings, I want to try and give you some context. Now of course as I talked about booking, this did not show up in any way shape or form in our revenue. ERP and HCM's booking growth rate has accelerated about last four quarters and now was in the high-30s. In addition, we saw our largest movement of the installed base customers to ERP cloud. We're almost roughly 200 customers moving in the quarter, all that of course shows up in bookings and not revenue.","In addition, SaaS net bookings, let me try to say this carefully. SaaS net bookings which factor in our non-renewals were the highest ever in the Company's history for a non-Q4 and up in the high 30s percent. Our tech ecosystem GAAP -- tech ecosystem was $21 billion on a trailing 12 months basis and Q2 was up 1% growth with database new license and support revenues up low single digits. Larry is going to talk quite a bit more about autonomous database. We are seeing more than a thousand trial activations per month currently between data warehouse and transactional basis, and this number continues to ramp. Now, we also had our cloud and customer solution, which has been one of our exciting offerings, revenue up triple digits, booking up in the low 40 percentage.","Now, I'm going to mention the few customer names that I thought I would explain some of the wins in the quarter that are behind some of the apps numbers I described. In general, I'm going to talk about some back office wins and a few fold suites win. One win was at MGM. This is MGM Resorts, the hospitality company, ERP really our full suite, including supply chain that actually replaced a product called Infineum, which is part of Blizzard brands inside import. We had a very large win at a large -- at a distribution company whose name I can't mention, but it was a complete suite win ERP, HCM -- by the way, this is a theme I'm going to tell you about how will we win ERP. It is now increasingly that we connect HCM through that win. People want the same UI, user interface, the same workflow, et cetera. And so ERP has the tremendous effect on pulling HCM, HCM through.","Another exciting win we had was at Johnson Controls. Johnson Controls was again a sweet win where we sold them service cloud, both our service cloud and our field service solutions and really to one of their divisions also ERP in their Tyco division, very exciting win for us. Hormel food processor, great win for us. ERP, our full suite of ERP inclusive of HCM very exciting. A company called Securitas probably makes even performing security in many major facilities around the country, but again a full suite win there. Helzberg Diamonds, again a full suite win there as well. Indiana University Health Center, this is again another -- this actually was a Lawson, if you've heard of the Lawson product, we replaced there with ERP, EPM really a full suite in addition into HCM.","So, I won't go through all the color with all these, but let me just read out some more names for you just so you get some context for it; Littlewoods a retailer, Samsonite, Verifone, Department of the Environment in Australia Land and Water really significant win for us there; the European operations of Toyota, very significant win for us in ERP, Marvell Semiconductor; I'm going to run out of minutes here, Dana Corporation, very nice win for us, DHL in Italy, Gilead Sciences, Ithaca College, and I'm going to stop I know because it just keeps going, but this was, as I've told you, the biggest net bookings we've had in our history of non-Q4 and the stock buybacks by the way bookings statement and they're supported by these quality wins.","So, last thing I wanted to do was before I close is just talk to you about a survey that came out from IDC. And I've talked to IDC about it and I have to read this literally. So I have to read it to you in its entirety to make sure that I get the message that they want across. So I'm going to do it. Let me start with open quotes, this is from IDC. \"In the SaaS view survey IDC released in October of 2018, were surveyed 276 HCM SaaS customers on their experience with SaaS HCM vendors, including Oracle, Workday and SAP Success Factors. Oracle SaaS HCM is the highest rated among the three vendors in most SCAP scoring categories, including vendor satisfaction, likelihood to recommend vendor to a colleague, data security, trusted brand, lower TCO, value for the price paid, ease-of-use, superior features functionality, ease of implementation, customer support service, product innovation and geographical reach.\" The reason I wanted to read that to you is instead of that coming from me and my opinion, this comes from an independent analyst community and I want to make sure I share that with you.","Let me just close to say it was a solid quarter again with 19% EPS growth and 10% free cash flow growth. The strength of our bookings growth along with climbing renewal rates gives me confidence that our cloud apps businesses is only, only going to strengthen from here. If I'm not being clear, this is perhaps the best apps quarter we've had just in terms of bookings, breadth of bookings across the portfolio and the visibility that gives us into the revenue backlog. Looking forward, we still expect full year revenue growth will be higher than last year and EPS will grow double digits for the year.","And with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Larry for his comments.","Larry Ellison","Thank you, Mark. Oracle has two strategic products that will determine the future of our company, Cloud ERP and the Autonomous Database. Virtually every technology analyst organization agrees, Gartner, Forester, IDC and the rest. Please read the published reports, that Oracle has developed the world's most advanced ERP technology, featuring an easy-to-use voice interface, and machine learning based artificial intelligence to automate many formerly manual ERP processes.","But more than being simply the technology leader in ERP applications, the analyst also confirmed that Oracle has translated that technology leadership into market leadership in cloud ERP with nearly 6,000 Fusion ERP customers plus more than 16,000 NetSuite customers, and we\u2019re adding about 1,000 new cloud ERP customers every quarter.","Technology analysts also believe that Oracle\u2019s new Autonomous Database gives Oracle the largest technology lead we\u2019ve ever enjoyed over our database competitors since we entered the database market almost four decades ago. As we pair our new Autonomous Database with our new generation two cloud infrastructure, we expect not only to hold on to our 50% database market share, we expect to increase it. That means millions of Oracle database will move to the Oracle Cloud. Those are the two strategic initiatives that we are focused. One, continue to expand our market leadership in cloud ERP, which should make us the world's largest cloud application company. And two, maintain our database technology leadership and migrate our 50% database market share to the Oracle Cloud. We\u2019re optimistic about our ability to deliver on these two strategic initiatives and our ability to be the leader in these two key market segments.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Okay, so I think we\u2019re ready for questions.","Ken Bond","We\u2019re ready for Q&A, Victoria.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.","Mark Moerdler","SaaS ERP is the largest growth driver within SaaS and, we believe within your total apps business, but there's so many moving parts that it is not obvious in the reported results. Can you give us a sense of when you expect that SaaS ERP will be large enough and growing fast enough to start to visibly improve year-over-year revenue growth first in SaaS and then in overall apps? And then as a quick follow-up, can you give us any color on the timing of conversions booked to revenue, has it improved or not? Thank you.","Mark Hurd","The answer to both questions is no. No, no, so first -- I was kidding. So, it's holiday seasons. I thought it was time for festive commentary. First, I think -- first of all, it is happening, so when you look at first and breaking it into pieces, the next week performance has been spectacular as this one piece of it. When we bought NetSuite, NetSuite was growing 15-ish percent and set this as color on our calls, their bookings starting if you went into Q3 of last year and Q4 was spectacular, Q1 was strong again. They had another very strong bookings quarters, again, in Q2 and their revenue growth has now gone to 25-ish percent in the quarter. So that is obviously significant for us in terms of their scale and now the improved growth rate.","I really have, I don\u2019t want to say higher expectations, but I continue to have high expectations that they will continue that momentum that we see in increased growth rate. The Fusion growth rate in ERP is even higher than NetSuite. And I hope by the quality of the wins I described to you, you'll get a flavor for the popularity of that solution in our marketplace. So when we combine those two together, our target is that we could see hundreds, if not -- just I want to be careful way the line here, Mark. We can get into close to $1 billion worth of growth next year out of those two solutions. I'm not giving you the number I'm telling you that that opportunity for us in scale. But to add to it, the thing that I tried to make sure was clear on the wins we're describing is the pull when we sell ERP, the ability for us to pull other solutions with it is new and nothing but growing, particularly at this stage. Does that answer your question?","Mark Moerdler","You also pointed me in the right direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.","Brad Zelnick","Larry, I think we all appreciate how sticky Oracle database is, even it stores some of the most valuable information in the world. But the competitive noise in the market just keeps getting louder and louder. What's your latest thinking on the competitive dynamics for database?","Larry Ellison","Well, there is a wonderful Gartner report that ranks the technology. They work all database technology, Oracle ranked with a huge number one lead by Gartner. A distant second is Microsoft. A distant third is IBM. And ridiculously distant for us is Amazon who is making all the noise. We think we have -- we have a huge technology leadership in database over Amazon. What Amazon did is they got their database. And by the way, Amazon Aurora is just my sequel Open Source, and Amazon Redshift is also just a borrowed Open Source system. These are very old systems that Amazon took Open Source databases and gave them an Amazon name and put them on the Amazon Cloud.","Now the beauty of what Amazon did is they put them on the Amazon cloud and they made them available on the cloud. They did that long before we made the Oracle database available on the cloud. But in terms of technology, there is no way that someone can move -- a normal person would move from an Oracle database to an Amazon database. It's just incredibly expensive and complicated and you've got to be willing to give up tons of reliability, tons of security, tons of performance to go ahead and do it. But we have a huge technology advantage.","Again, don\u2019t believe me read the Gartner report. We've never had -- the Oracle autonomous database has the biggest technology lead we have ever had in the database world from a technology standpoint. The problem is we have to deliver that autonomous database on first-class cloud infrastructure to be successful in the cloud business. We need more than just a great database. We have the best database but we also need first-class infrastructure to run that database on.","And we now finally have that with our generation two cloud, and I think you'll see the combination of the Oracle Autonomous Database in the generation two cloud. You'll see rapid migration of Oracle from on-premise to the Oracle public cloud and to the Oracle cloud customer. So, we think -- as I've said in my opening remarks, we think we are not only going to hold on to our 50% share, we're going to expand it. Nobody to save maybe -- Jeff Bezos gave the command I want to get off the Oracle database. And they've been working on this for a few years to try to get off the Oracle database and get on to the Amazon databases. It's taken Amazon who is dedicated to doing this several years and they are not there yet, why nobody else is going to go through that forth march, to get go on to the Amazon databases if Amazon can't even get there without this effort. We are confident we hold on to it\u2026","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies.","John DiFucci","My question is a follow-up to Brad's and Larry, and I think it's more for Mark or may be Larry too. We understand your focus on moving your 50% relational database market share to the Oracle cloud, but that's going to take time for your customers to get there. And until then, they will likely consider to buy for on-premise deployments. This quarter platform and infrastructure grew 1% constant currency and we realized there is headwinds in there from like the middleware business and probably some other things, but more interested in the database. As you say Larry that that's one of the strategic products as that has to be successful here. Can you give us some more color on the database in this quarter, especially for the options? And to that stand out for me or multi-tenancy and in memory, but I know there is other that are associated with the autonomous database. I mean these are two, but others that are really specifically. And I guess when will we see those tailwinds from whatever middleware and whatever else is causing them to subside in that part of the business?","Mark Hurd","Larry, will start and then I can follow up through the numbers for you, John.","Larry Ellison","Okay, the autonomous, the database options grew about 4% in the quarter. And we've never had a quarter that I know of where the database business has not grown, the database license business has not grown. The issue has been when will we get our cloud infrastructure solid enough to host our database? And the answer is, we did that several months ago. But less than a year-ago, less than a year-ago, we got the infrastructure in shape, OCI, the generation two of our infrastructure is now there. We're now running thousands of Oracle autonomous database trails that our customers look at this.","And customers can migrate from on-premise to the autonomous database very, very quickly. It is not -- it's not a technology upgrade, it's just an update, just move your data, drop a few indexes and you're there, you can do it very quickly. So we expect that the uptake next fiscal year we're going to get enough business for the Oracle database and the Oracle public cloud to move the needle. The answer to the question, when does ERP actually move the needle? When does ERP get around the billion dollar growth rate? And Mark said, we got a shot at doing that next year. We have a shot at doing the same thing, moving the needle the same distance with Autonomous Database, next year.","Mark Hurd","By the way, John, just a couple points rather to Larry's points. We haven't had a quarter where database license and support didn't ever grow. And the options -- just to follow up a little bit of color, the autonomous options actually grew the fastest of the group of options. So again, while the trials or what I said, we've had thousands of trials and they're growing monthly, which is again to Larry's point about next year's impact on revenue. The options are a pretty good precursor of that, that you're seeing those options like active data guard, multitenant et cetera that are really driving the options growth that Larry described.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.","Phil Winslow","Just want to follow up on, Larry, your last comment there about the Autonomous Database. I mean, obviously, the transactional database just in August and data warehousing went in earlier this year. But I think what has the feedback been from customers, why is interest level growing? Is it cost? Is the availability, et cetera? Maybe just some more color on what you're hearing from clients now that the two options have been live out there? And then just to your point there about the adoption of the life cycle. Wondering if you can step us through that, what are the key milestones you think that customers need to see to then start hitting the inflection point on adoption?","Larry Ellison","Okay, I'll tell you that the thing I thought would drive the autonomous usage was reduction of labor cost, you eliminate human, labor you lower cost, you eliminate human labor, you lower errors. What has really been driving is productivity. They've been able to get -- we've had customers that literally got their databases up and running in 15 minutes. And existing customers, existing DBAs put up another system in 15 minutes whereas a normal quantum to put something up like that was 15 days.","So the fact that the existing teams at DBAs our primary customers can make themselves dramatically more productive, get 10 times more done in the same time period than they could prior to the autonomous database has been the thing that has been most shocking to our customers. And it's the thing that's driving -- that we think is actually going to drive the migration more so than, if you will, closing data centers and reducing labor costs.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie.","Sarah Hindlian","This is a question for Safra and Mark. It's obviously a very turbulent market out there. So I'd appreciate it if you both could tell us a little bit about what you're hearing from customers when you meet with them? What are they telling about how they see the world in light of all the volatility that's going on?","Safra Catz","So many of our customers, especially those moving to SaaS and moving to the cloud, are looking for ways to increase productivity to spend a lot less money, running their back offices and to get real business insight from the technology. And there's an immense amount of excitement around it frankly. In fact, a number of our customers that may use one of our cloud products are now moving to our other cloud products without even doing a full RFP and competitive analysis, because they\u2019ve been so satisfied with our product. In fact just today, I\u2019ve got a call from this very well known company and they\u2019ve already picked our ERP, and we\u2019re so happy they\u2019re just going to roll out HCM and supply chain management now next.","So, there\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm around our products. As a general matter regardless of the economy, our products save them money. So, it gives them more money to invest in other things, and that\u2019s what obviously I focus on with them.","Mark Hurd","I\u2019d say listen, Sarah, most of our customers want to focus on their business, focus on growing their business, they want to focus on their customers that they do to make money. I think IT and I know you all know this but most of what\u2019s going on in business IT today is most of the big budgets are spent on maintenance, keeping the existing applications, the existing infrastructure just running, very little innovation. The teams here with the products we\u2019ve is now to change basically their paradigm, to shift their IT budget to our R&D budgets. And this is very attractive to our customers to transfer the work from them to us, and while they do it -- to use the line, Larry, always uses which is, they have to be willing to spend less as they do that. And then they get all this innovation at the same time.","So the fact that -- and this has now become something that we don\u2019t have to evangelize to Safra's point, it\u2019s becoming more mainstream in every dialogue. I mean this last week, I was in the Midwest, so our 10s of customers. And I would tell you it\u2019s one of that the first trips where I didn\u2019t spend evangelizing much, I've spent more time really talking about what we could do, meaning the maturation of the market now is as a normal course of business, how can we help save money, get more innovation at the same time. And by the way, I\u2019d just add to Larry\u2019s point while he talked about the great advantages. Customers do want to get out of data centers. They do want to get out of service. They do want to get out of infrastructure. They typically don\u2019t help our customers advance their business.","So when you can do all this form and you can help save money and drive innovation, this is a big deal out in the market and this is what our customers are talking about.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow","Can I -- given that the comps are getting easier on the ops ecosystem for the second half, so there\u2019s almost ton of the room for accelerating further. Can you double click again on that ERP NetSuite strength? I mean, you\u2019ve 16,000 customers but in theory you have big market and you\u2019re reaccelerating it. Can you double click on what\u2019s working there and how big that could get overtime?","Mark Hurd","Well, sort of everything. So just to be clear on NetSuite, there\u2019re -- and I\u2019ve been through this before but it's a risk of going over again. There\u2019re three core tenants as we bought NetSuite that we really focused on. One was we believe they were underserved in terms of the amount of sales resource they\u2019ve in the market place. We\u2019ve increased that dramatically, both domestically. And make sure I am clear to you, from a lot of the growth we\u2019ve had in NetSuite isn\u2019t just international, it\u2019s domestic. They\u2019ve had a tremendous run in the United States of America just simply getting the more customers, and we\u2019ve also expanded their resource internationally and we\u2019ve grown internationally, so just more sales resources have been part of it. Second, we\u2019ve increased their R&D to get to more countries. So, with Release 19.1, we are in -- 18.1 and 18.2, we are now covering more, more countries than we were before. So, we have more sales people with more products available in more locations.","Third, we are very focused on industries. So when we say industries, we don\u2019t mean something like just retail. We actually go into micro segments into the marketplace, like trying campus bookstores and say, we are going to really get features for that to discrete micro segment. So those three fundamentals of more sales resource, more countries, more micro segments, those are the three key fundamentals that we have driven. By the way we follow one of that same formula, the Fusion, which is really the same formula that we drive there. NetSuite just done a great job, that team has done a great job. And if I haven't been effusive enough about, I'm thrilled with their performance and what they have done and their future.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.","Michael Turits","If Autonomous Database dose as well as you expect, what's the impact of that on Infrastructure as a Services? Is there feedback there?","Larry Ellison","Well, Autonomous Database and exited the services on Autonomous Database we think will be between third and half of our infrastructure. So, obviously, it's going to drive infrastructure, it is the driving force in infrastructure. We think moving -- if we did nothing but run Oracle applications in the Oracle public cloud and Oracle ISD applications, so all we did was moved Turner over and all these other guys over. And all the existing Oracle applications, we'd be more than 10 times bigger than Amazon that\u2019s all we did. But we are -- of course, we are ambitious to do more than that. We have the big SaaS business as well. But the Oracle Database will drive the infrastructure business. It will be between -- around 50% of that business and maybe more.","Safra Catz","I think that's -- it for us. Let me just say one other thing, to the extent that Autonomous Database does very well also, you can imagine that our margins on PaaS, IaaS, they just go through the roof. So, the more of our infrastructure that is -- is that not only are the revenues up, but the margins really skyrocket.","Ken Bond","Okay, thanks Safra. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thanks for joining us today.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Victoria for closing.","Operator","Thank you for joining today\u2019s Oracle's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to introduce Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations, Oracle. Please go ahead, sir.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Erin. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which include a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.","On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Larry Ellison; President and CFO, Safra Catz; and President, Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-Q and 10-K and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price for stock.","And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra A. Catz","Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2 and turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments.","Before I start, I want to point out a couple of things about the quarter's report. First of all, because the U.S. dollar strengthened over the last year, our as-reported results actually partially masked the underlying strength of our business.","During the first quarter, currency movement reduced new license revenues by 5%, total revenues by 5%, net income and earnings per share by 6%, which is $0.03 per share compared to Q1 of last year. So I'll focus on constant currency growth rates, unless I state otherwise.","Secondly, as we offer cloud services, which combine our applications and technology products in a service, the historical line between our technology and application results is less relevant. So we will now disclose a combined new software license and cloud software subscription revenue number, though we will break out the cloud revenue number for you.  Expenses will not be broken out, because the same sales organization and the same development organization are the bulk of the expenses in both our on-premise software and cloud offering.","Okay. Now for the quarter. We are pleased with our software results as new software license and cloud subscription revenues were $1.6 billion, up 11% and building off a solid base of 11% up last year. Cloud revenue for the quarter was $222 million.","In addition, we continue to see broad-based strength as the quarter was balanced with new license and cloud subscriptions growing 14% in the Americas. That's on a GAAP basis -- actually, 16% on a non-GAAP basis -- 12% in APAC, while Europe saw growth of 1%, on top of 15% growth last year on a GAAP basis. The quarter was also not dependent on any large deals. Software license update and product support revenues were $4.1 billion, up 8% and up 1%, sequentially. In U.S. dollars on the income statement chart, it appears that support is down sequentially, but this is entirely a result of currency fluctuation as support attach and renewal rates continue at the usual high levels.","Hardware system products revenue was $779 million. Engineered systems continue to grow at triple digit rates.","For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $8.2 billion, up 3% from last year. Our non-GAAP operating income of $3.6 billion was 6% higher than last year as our operating margin expanded to 44% from 42% last year. We still believe there remains a lot of leverage in our business model.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23.4%, nearly on top of the guidance rate I gave last quarter. EPS for the quarter grew 11% in U.S. dollars to $0.53 on a non-GAAP basis. Without the negative impact of currency, our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been 3% higher at $0.56, up 17%.","Our GAAP tax rate was 24.7%, which was higher than my guidance for last quarter. On a GAAP basis, EPS for the quarter was $0.41 in U.S. dollars. And without the impact of currency, GAAP EPS would have been $0.44, up 24%. Now our GAAP earnings per share included $306 million minimum payment related to our lawsuit against SAP, which is their payment to us, which we exclude from our non-GAAP numbers.","Operating cash flow increased to a record $14 billion over the last 4 quarters, with operating cash flow increasing this quarter to an all-time high of $5.7 billion, up from $5.4 billion last year. Free cash flow grew to a record $13.4 billion over the last 4 quarters. We now have nearly $32 billion in cash and marketable securities.","Now as we said, we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through our technical innovation, acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. And this quarter, we increased our share repurchases again as we repurchased 104.2 million shares for a total of $3.1 billion in the quarter. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased nearly 300 million shares for a total of $8.2 billion. And the Board again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share.","Now to the guidance. New software license and cloud subscription revenue is expected to range from 6% to 16% in constant currency and 5% to 15% in reported dollars on a non-GAAP basis. On a GAAP basis, New software license and cloud subscription revenue is expected to range from 5% to 15% in constant currency and 4% to 14% in reported currency.","Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from a negative 18% to a negative 8% in constant dollars and reported currency. As a result, total revenue growth on a non-GAAP and GAAP basis is expected to range from 1% to 5% in constant dollars and 0% to 4% in U.S. dollars.","Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.59 and $0.63 in both U.S. dollars and in constant currency, up from $0.54 last year. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.45 to $0.49 in U.S. dollars and in constant currency. Now this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 24% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 25%. Of course, that may end up being different.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.","Mark V. Hurd","Thanks, Safra. Just a couple of quick comments before I give it to Larry. Software, we got to a solid start with 11% CD growth. It's a little better than we expected. Double-digit growth in the U.S., Latin America and Asia Pacific.","In cloud, we will add some key cloud wins in both CRM and HCM, including Accenture, Adobe, Airstream, Barnes & Noble, Cisco, Colgate-Palmolive, Cox Communications, DIRECTV, Kraft Foods, Macy's, NVIDIA, Proctor & Gamble, Sandia National Labs, Schneider Electric and Telstra.","Now I don't usually read that list because it takes a period of time. But today, I wanted you to know that this is just tremendous customer acceptance that we're seeing, and our pipeline and our team are still ramping. So I wanted to make sure you just had some flavor for the kind of acceptance we're seeing.","We expect we'll be at or over $1 billion run rate next quarter, and we believe we have the people and the services to win a lot of business in the cloud.","Let me go to Engineered Systems. It was another strong, exit [ph] quarter, with revenue more than doubling last year. We had great Exadata wins at Verizon, Nissan, Petrobras, Bank of America and GlaxoSmithKline.","Exalogic had a great quarter, with unit sales nearly 3x last year. Wins at Accenture, Hutchison Global, United Healthcare, Agilent and CalPERS. And Exalytics had a strong ramp, with incalculable growth, obviously, since we introduced it late last year, but with great wins at the state of California, Macy's, Praxair and Toshiba.","On other hardware. We have the hottest UNIX box in the industry with the SPARC T-Series. We grew double digits, and we expect to see continued momentum Q2, Q3 and for the rest of the year with this machine.","In our verticals. We continue to see strength in our industry focus solutions. We had double-digit CD growth again in our vertical industry businesses. We've ramped our headcount in this area, and we expect they will have another strong year.","Now as an FYI, this week, we introduced the Oracle banking platform. It's one of the most significant product releases from our Financial Services business unit.","As it relates to people, as we discussed in Q4, we realigned our sales force last quarter and entered the year with all of our people having a boss, a territory and a comp plan. They're in the market now and growing their pipeline as we speak.","In closing, sales headcount is up year-on-year, and our pipeline growth reflects that. Expect us to continue to be aggressive in the cloud, driving our Fusion Applications solutions. We've been aggressive in hiring up in Business Analytics, and we believe that combination with our Exalytics solutions, we're extremely well positioned there. We expect that Engineered Systems, ZFS, our SPARC T-Series will continue to see strong growth throughout the year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Thank you, Mark. Let's see. A week from Sunday, at Oracle OpenWorld, we'll announce the addition of Infrastructure as a Service to the Oracle Cloud. With that addition, Oracle will be providing its customers with all 3 tiers of cloud computing: Software as a Service, Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service. Our SaaS offering includes complete application suites for CRM, HCM and ERT. Today, Oracle delivers more SaaS applications than any other cloud service provider in the world.","Our PaaS offering, or Platform as a Service, includes the most popular database in the world, Oracle, and the most popular programming language in the world, Java. Those 2 industry-standard platform services, combined with our new social network service platform, gives our customers the tools they need to rapidly develop modern applications that run in the cloud.","Our new Infrastructure as a Service offering provides secure, virtualized, compute and storage services. In the Oracle Cloud or -- and this is very important, an identical infrastructure service installed in our customer data center as an Oracle-managed private cloud, customers can easily move their applications from traditional custom and packaged applications to our modern Fusion SaaS applications, back and forth between the Oracle Cloud and their private cloud.","Please join us at Oracle OpenWorld for all the details of our new Infrastructure as a Service offering.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Larry. Operator, we'll please move to the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Kash Rangan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess a question for you, Mark. The company has had an increasingly diverse product portfolio. You've got some of the faster growth products like Exa series and the cloud apps. But given the diversity in the landscape, how do you think about your sales and go-to-market strategy and getting that balance between the core database applications business and finding the right amount of growth for all these exciting new opportunities?","Mark V. Hurd","Yes. Kash, I'll start, and Larry may want to add. I mean, we focus our sales forces, we specialize them so there's actually a sales force that's focused exclusively on selling database, our database offerings, and that's combined with Exadata. So you would find the same thing in Middleware. They would be focused on selling Middleware, and they'd be focused on selling Exalogic in combination with Middleware. And that would go on through our product lines. So our sales forces are very focused. So to your point, as we introduce new products, we bring a sales force typically focused along with that new products. So the potential distraction that you may have described is actually eliminated. We keep them very focused, we train them as such and we point them directly and line them up against our secular competitors.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Yes. I mean, I think that's the point. We've reorganized our sales force in Q1-- before Q1 so that we had a dedicated HCM sales force. So if HCM in the cloud becomes very, very hot, we can add reps and add capability in the HCM sales force without distracting -- and the database sales force, it's business as usual. The Middleware sales force, it's business as usual. But again, we'd be adding a lot of reps in HCM, and that's what we're doing. We're adding a lot of reps in service as we move our RightNow service offerings in the cloud around the world and sell it more aggressively in Asia Pacific and in Europe. Same thing with the sales application, our new marketing applications, which are socially enabled. Those are the applications that listen to what people are saying about your product on Facebook, what people are saying about your product in Twitter. It provides that insight to our customers and lets the customers -- then respond and take advantage of those insights. So we have separate dedicated sales forces lined up against our secular competitors that we can expand as the opportunity expands.","Mark V. Hurd","Yes, Kash, I'd add to it. There's also metrics, quotas, pipelines, all the instrumentation is lined up exactly the way Larry described. So we have the ability, any day if you want, to measure our progress, our pipe, our headcount in any geography, in any country, on any specialized product line. So pretty effective model.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jason Maynard of Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have a question for Larry. Oracle's been through many technology platform shifts. And obviously, there is a big one with 11i E-business Suite last decade. Given that you're now rolling out Fusion Cloud Services coming to bear, it'd be great to get your perspective on what you can draw, if you will, from that experience, what you think is different and what are the key things that Oracle has to do to win in this round with the cloud market?","Lawrence J. Ellison","Well, as you know, a lot of companies have a difficult time adapting to the next generation of technology. And those with the most are also the ones with the most to lose. You have to be willing to change the way you were doing business in the past and adapt to the new opportunities and exploit the new opportunities. So we move very -- well, we decided -- we actually decided, almost 7 years ago, to develop our Fusion Applications, a new generation of applications, which were -- there was no term called cloud then. It was simply called SaaS. So we decided to offer those new applications as a service. We started developing it 7 years ago. Now that we actually them in the marketplace and, for example, HCM is very -- Fusion is very hot. It was hard to build, and it's very hot right now. Not only do we have that product available, we now have to reorganize our sales force, which was -- any change is difficult. We had to reorganize the sales force and get -- have a dedicated sales force focused on HCM. So you have to first recognize that the change is coming. I think we did that 7 years ago with the development of Fusion Applications, and then do the really hard thing, which is, say, okay, guys, these are our old competitors. These are our new competitors. This is what we used to push. Now this is what we're pushing now, which is a cloud service against this specific secular competitor. Retrain your salespeople, add salespeople, specialize your salespeople and focus on these new market opportunities. There's a lot of inertia in a big company. We have 120,000 employees, and it takes a lot of management focus to move people from business-as-usual to pursue these new opportunities. That means retraining and doing things differently. It's not easy, but it's essential. We've done it before. We've done it before successfully. In that sense, this is no different. It's just that we're a lot bigger than we used to be.","Operator","We'll go now to Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I know you don't break out apps versus tech anymore, and you have obviously just commented on your apps strategy. But I was wondering if you could spend some time talking about the trends that you're seeing in the database business in terms of just competition, growth in the market, et cetera? And obviously, Database 11g has been a huge release, but it's getting a little long in the tooth -- there's obviously been growing chatter in the industry about a pending 12c release, which, I'm assuming, the \"c\" is for cloud. So Larry, wondering if you can also just talk about just future innovations within database and also what that means, just vis-\u00e0-vis your competition.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Well, our big competitor in database and -- in fact, our big competitor in infrastructure, database, middleware, servers is IBM. And we're announcing Oracle 12c at Oracle OpenWorld. So we're rolling out the new version of our database, which had some very exciting specific features for the cloud. So again, if you will -- I'm not sure I want to use the multi-tenant term, but it's kind of -- these have been called multi -- we have a thing called plausible databases, which allow multiple tenants to securely coexist in the same database and, of course, submit them. And then that's covered with virtualization. So we take the belt and suspenders approach to security and make sure your data is isolated and private and safe and secure. So we've done a bunch of work on the database for the cloud. We'll see that -- as I say, that's coming out, announced at OpenWorld and coming out December, January, February next year, in the next few months. That's a very, very big deal. The primary competitor, IBM, I believe, continues to lose share to us every quarter, as does our second competitor, which is SQL Server. After SQL Server, we have some interesting specialized competitors like Teradata. And we believe that Exadata is doing a pretty good job of competing with Teradata. So we don't do lots and lots of head-to-head competitions with Teradata yet. I think we're going to be watching that business, and we're going to be focusing on competing more aggressively with Teradata than we have in the past. But we think we have a better product than our competitors. And all statistics we see is we continue to take share, especially in our larger customers.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John DiFucci of JPMorgan.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have a question for Mark. Mark, not long ago, we heard you talk about how selling Engineered Systems has been somewhat of an evangelized sale, requires an IT organization to think differently in regards to architecture and even personnel. But you've also -- we heard you say, and it makes sense, that it's a better solution. With a lower total cost of ownership, it's going to happen. Now I'm not trying to say -- this business has done well, and you've talked about how it did this quarter, and it sounds like it's growing and it's doing really well. But I mean, personally, my team thinks that it -- there's even a brighter future here. How close have we gotten to when customers feel like they're ready to broadly buy Engineered Systems, and especially Exadata and buy in mass?","Mark V. Hurd","I'll try to give you a baseball analogy. I think we're in the first inning. So as you described these numbers -- and I agree, John, with your characterization. I mean, these are great numbers on a -- for a start of a product, et cetera. But relative to the magnitude of the industry opportunity, you've got a $60 billion -- $55 billion to $60 billion server market, and that market actually doubles when you include the storage. And you have to include storage to really look at the magnitude of what's in front of us from an Exadata perspective. And you have to add what we can do with Middleware and apps with Exalogic and so forth and so on. So this really is what you described. Now what you see us doing, and I read off some very, very large, well-known logos that are now adopting the technology. But we're winning a project at a time, and we're gaining more and more architectural wins as we go. And so, John, we just scratched the surface with this. And that's why, to Larry's point, we specialize our sales force, why we train them, why we focus them the way we do. And just the point being, do I think there's huge upside in the overall Engineered Systems business? Yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Adam Holt of Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is about Fusion. Now you've been in the market for a little while. To the extent you're comfortable sharing any details with respect to customer adds, where are you seeing demand from a module perspective? And if you could, what the mix is or general mix between on-premise and hosted, just a general flavor for the adoption.","Lawrence J. Ellison","I'll start with Fusion. The hottest part of our Fusion Suite is HCM, and we're seeing the adoption broadly being in the cloud. Fusion is very interesting. It can run on-premise, run in the cloud. And now, with it's -- our latest announcement, it can run on a private -- an Oracle-managed private cloud in your data center. So -- which is kind of midway between -- it's not on-premise because we take responsibility for managing it. We own the server. We run it. It just is behind your firewall in your data center -- the cloud. But overwhelmingly, the choice has been to put these HCM applications in the cloud. Mark, you wanted to add to that?","Mark V. Hurd","Yes. I think, to Larry's point, we had very strong HCM wins in the quarter. I mean, remember, we sell HCM by module. So you've also -- you've got a recruiting app, we've got the ability to get a work-based compensation app. We've got a core HR app, but the wins were tens and tens and tens of wins in HCM. We're seeing the same ramp now on the sales side. So sales automation really with the product is not as mature as HCM, but we've now released it. It's in the market. We now have references. And we had a very, very strong start, and I tried to give you some names in that -- in the early part with sales automation. But again, all of those are SaaS implementations in the quarter. You also know RightNow. We actually go to market by service automation as well, and particularly outside the U.S., which was a key issue for us, was -- RightNow was very strong domestically. We had a strong RightNow quarter outside the U.S. as we began to take that product around the world. So it's very strong right now.","Lawrence J. Ellison","[indiscernible]. So HCM has been the #1 Fusion offering, now closely followed by sales. The interesting thing is we're seeing our specialized competition from both salesforce.com and Workday and seeing virtually no SAP in either of these areas.","Operator","We'll go now to Brent Thill of UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Larry, there's increasing attention around Social for the enterprise, and I was curious if you can give us your view and your role on monetizing this trend and how you think it plays in your cloud strategy.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Well, last year, we announced basically social network services as a part of our cloud platform. Now there's 2 ways to look at Social: You can look at Social as a separate application. In other words, as a SaaS application, which our friends at salesforce.com, that's the way they put it in their architectural slide. We actually put Social at the platform level. It's really a tool that allows you to socially enable any application that you're building. So you would use Java, the Oracle database and our social network services to build a modern social application with social characteristics. So when -- we think it's a tool. Social is not an application, a stand-alone application. Rather, it's integrated with the platform and all of the applications you build on top of that platform become social. What I mean by that is then they all -- you can communicate. If you're -- one group is using an HR application, another group is using a sales application. Those are both sales -- social applications and the HR people can communicate directly with the salespeople and so on. So we put it at the platform level as a tool, not as a stand-alone application level. And we can think that's -- is that architectural difference is a big deal.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I know you are going to say more at the user conference on this as a dedicated session. How far do you think this is from your ability to monetize this?","Lawrence J. Ellison","I think we're monetizing it now. Again, we're very happy we're in the market on the Fusion side. So all of the -- again, all of the -- do you mean specifically the social network services? Or just cloud applications? Monetize what? These are [indiscernible] which you -- what you're asking.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Your Social Platform.","Lawrence J. Ellison","All right. Well, again, the Social Platform adds value to all of our applications. So it adds value to our HR -- our HCM applications. It adds value to our sales applications. It adds value to our service application. So we're not measuring Social as a separate stand-alone thing. Rather, it's adding value and allowing all of these other applications to integrate and communicate. So we're monetizing it now. It's made our HCM applications more competitive against Workday. It makes our sales applications more competitive against salesforce. So we sell more of those. It's more of a differentiator and advantage. So that's one part of it. Then there's this other part of Social. Again, it's a big area. In marketing, social marketing, Social kind of at the center of the marketing applications where we listen to the Twitter feeds, we look at the Facebook posts, we let companies analyze what people are saying about their products and services in other social networks. And then we present that information and insight to them and let them -- and you can take action on that. For example, it comes directly out of our social analysis tools and let's -- and you can feed it directly into service, into our RightNow service. Or we have tools, social tools that allow you to build a Facebook presence, a store on Facebook. So it makes it -- so marketing, modern marketing, if you will, is very social-centric. But that's not the only place we're using social. We're using it across all of our apps. But I suppose it's most conspicuous in modern marketing.","Operator","And let's take our next question from Brad Reback of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Brad Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","For Mark. Last year, Mark, you guys hired over 3,000, broadly speaking, new sales heads. I think 500 alone in 4Q. How should we think about the ramp of those salespeople? How is it progressing? And then number two, when do we really start to see the impact on the growth rate of the overall business from those people?","Mark V. Hurd","Well, you're seeing it. And I think when you look at our Q1, when you look at the guidance we just gave you on Q2, we have more people in the field than we had, to your point. We have certain areas we're continuing to hire. We're very focused in the areas Larry described around our Fusion apps. We're hiring in Business Analytics as well still today. Now many of those people that we started in Q1 and sort of mid-Q2, it's typically a 9-month, 12-month ramp, and that's why I made the comments earlier about the growth in our pipeline. And that's how we measure it. We measure it by rep. We know when you came in, we know your tenure, we know when you got trained, we know what your territory is and we can align your pipes directly to that territory. So you're beginning to see them feather into the productive category. As we go quarter by quarter, of course we get more productivity out of those folks that we hired.","Operator","And our final question will come from Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Mark, on the hardware side, you guys have been transitioning to Engineered Systems and away from the commodity server business. When does that bottom out? And how do you get confidence around that so that we get a consistent growth profile there? And then secondly, just quickly on margins. Good improvement there. What's your expectations as those go forward? And what's your biggest leverage point going forward?","Mark V. Hurd","I'll start. Listen. I think we're going to go -- as we talked about earlier, we'll see growth in Q4 of the overall business in hardware. We're very focused right now because we've got hot products, as we described with the T4. We're aggressively taking it to market. And so for us, it's in our best interest. And in the hardware business, if you just think about the products that we've released over the course of the past 18 months, Exadata, Exalogic, Exalytics, T4, ZFS, where we release new products, we drive growth. We gain share. I think you should expect that trend to continue. We've been -- in the places where we don't have differentiation, x86; or where we haven't refreshed, for example. You don't see that growth. To be very frank, our margins are going up, and our market positions in the markets that we care about are going up as well. And one last point I wanted to make, and I'll turn it over to Safra on operating margin, I want to make sure I was clear on the Engineering Systems point and to John's earlier question. I want to make sure you have context for this. Most of our customers are growing their data at 35%, 40%, 45% per year. That's today. That's before some of these Big Data applications that you hear about continue, continue to evolve on the scene. Most of our customers spend $8,500, $9,000 a terabyte to store the data that I described. Most of our customers spend 15% to 20% of their IT budget on storage. When you look at what we can do with Exadata and the compression we can bring to that very data set, in many cases, 10x means I had a petabyte. After we're done, you've got 100 terabytes. And the economic impact that has on our customers and any customer that's got an Oracle database estate is eligible to see those kind of opportunities. It's the reason we are so focused and you hear us talk so much about the opportunity with Engineered Systems and it's opportunity to change the landscape of the infrastructure and our customer's business. So the focus is going to be on driving the new products and driving growth as we described.","Safra A. Catz","On the margin side, there's really no reason why we can't get to the pre-Sun operating margins very soon. We're clearly on our way. We have the highest operating margins of the software companies in general. And even though we have a $3 billion, almost $4 billion hardware company buried in us, we will get to our pre-Sun, pre-hardware operating margins very soon. And clearly, we took another step in that direction this quarter. And as volumes increase in hardware, which they will, that will help also. But the business has -- otherwise, is just extremely strong.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back over to you, Mr. Bond, for any additional or closing remarks.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Erin. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to introduce Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations for Oracle. Please go ahead.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Robert. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which include a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.","On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Larry Ellison; President and CFO, Safra Catz; and President, Mark Hurd.","As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra A. Catz","Okay. Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I'll then review guidance for Q3 and turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments.","As all of you can see, we've had a really excellent quarter and we exceeded the high end of our guidance for new software license and cloud software subscriptions. We were at the high end of the range for total revenue, and we beat the high end of our guidance for earnings per share. During the second quarter, currency movements reduced new license revenue growth by 1%, that reduced total revenues actually by 2%; net income by 1%; and earnings per share by $0.01 compared to Q2 of last year. So I'll focus on constant-currency growth rates, unless I say otherwise.","Okay. Now to the numbers. New software license and cloud revenues were up 18%, including cloud revenue of $230 million for the quarter. We continue to see broad-based strength and balance with double-digit growth in all regions. The Americas were up 22%, APAC was up 13% and EMEA was up 12%. We also saw strength and balance across our software products, as Database, Middleware and Applications all saw double-digit growth.","Software license update and product support revenues were $4.3 billion, up 8% from last year and were nearly 1\/2 of total revenue. Support attach and renewal rates continue at their usual high levels. Hardware systems products revenue was $734 million. Engineered Systems continued to show excellent growth.","For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.1 billion, up 5% from last year in constant currency. Operating expenses were flat with last year, and non-GAAP operating income was up 10% from last year. And our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 47% from 45% last year. As revenues continue to grow and we manage our business with discipline, we still believe that there remains a lot of leverage in our business model.","Now the non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23.5%, better than guidance. EPS for the quarter grew 18% in U.S. dollars to $0.64 on a non-GAAP basis. Without the negative impact of currency, our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.65, up 19%. The GAAP tax rate was 21.3%. EPS for the quarter was $0.53 in U.S. dollars and would have been $0.54, up 26% but for the impact of currency.","Operating cash flow increased to $13.5 billion over the last 4 quarters, up from $13.1 billion last year. And free cash flow grew to $12.8 billion over the last 4 quarters. Both are record results for Q2.","We now have nearly $34 billion in cash and marketable securities. And now as we've said before, we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through our technical innovation, acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt. At dividend, in this quarter we repurchased 96.1 million shares for a total of 3 billion in the quarter. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased nearly 350 million shares for a total value of $10.2 billion. And earlier this month, the Board declared an accelerated dividend of $0.18 per share for the second, third and fourth quarters, which will be paid out in December.","Now to the guidance. New software license and cloud subscription revenue growth is expected to range from 4% to 14% in constant currency and 3% to 13% in reported dollars. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from a negative 10% to flat in constant and reported dollars. And as a result, total revenue growth on a GAAP to non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 2% to 6% in constant dollars, 1% to 5% in U.S. dollars.","Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.64 and $0.68 in both U.S. dollars and constant dollars, up from $0.62 last year. GAAP EPS is expected to be between $0.51 and $0.55 in U.S. and constant dollars. This guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 24% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24.5%.  And of course, it may end up being a bit different.","Now with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.","Mark V. Hurd","Thanks, Safra. Just a couple of quick comments before I give it to Larry. We had a great quarter in software with new license and cloud subscriptions growth of 18% in constant currency. It was better than we expected with double-digit growth in every region as well as Database, Middleware and Apps in particular, which were more than 30%.","In the cloud, we had key wins in both CRM and HCM, including Abercrombie & Fitch, Edwards Air [ph], Expedia, Macy's, T. Rowe Price, United Airlines, U.S. Bancorp, Whirlpool and Xerox; a lot of names as we continue to see strong customer acceptance. Our pipeline is growing. Our sales teams are ramping, and you should plan for us to continue to invest into and to grow the cloud business.","Moving to Engineered Systems, it was another strong exit quarter with over 70% sequential growth in unit bookings. We sold more than 700 Engineered Systems this quarter, great excellent wins at China Mobile, Facebook, Samsung, Time Warner Cable; and great Exalogic wins at Chevron, Vodafone and Wal-Mart. We had a very nice excellent win at Wespac in Australia. I mention this because they're moving off DB2 on the mainframe along EMC storage to Oracle and Exadata and Exalogic at very significant savings. Exalytics had its best quarter-to-date, as unit bookings nearly doubled sequentially wins at Activision, City of Chicago, Deloitte & Touche and WellPoint.","We continue to see strong growth as SPARC T-Series accelerate. I mentioned, in the last quarter, it was the hottest selling UNIX box in the industry, and it grew faster than it did in the previous quarter. And ZFS Storage also saw double-digit growth.","We had a tremendous quarter in our verticals with growth of over 60%, with even better results in financial services, telecom and retail. This company had a very strong Q4 and a strong Q1. We've invested in headcount in our verticals, and we're seeing that show up in significant pipeline growth.","Finally, our quota-carrying sales force, net of attrition, has grown more than 3,000 people over the last 6 quarters. And for those of you who care about efficiency, and we actually do, we've been able to do this while our operating expenses were essentially flat from last year. Our people in the market, they're growing pipeline, and we're beginning to see it in our strong organic growth this quarter.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Thanks, Mark. Our $7.5 billion purchase of Sun has already proven to be the most strategic and profitable acquisition Oracle has ever made. Java, the world's most popular programming language, was the key software asset we acquired when we bought Sun. Today our Java business is booming, growing over 34% this past quarter. Sun's hardware technology has enabled us to become a leader in the highly profitable Engineered Systems segment of the hardware business.","The rapid growth of highly differentiated products like Exadata and the SPARC T4 have consistently quarter-after-quarter improved the profitability of our overall hardwares business. Selling systems loaded with Oracle intellectual property, along with deemphasizing the selling of low-margin undifferentiated products like commodity x86 servers and LSI disk storage systems, products that contain no intellectual property, those 2 things have reshaped and downsized our hardware business, while making that business much more profitable.","Now that our hardware business is making a substantial contribution to Oracle's record levels of profitability, we are just about finished with the downsizing phase and the transformation of that business. We're about to start growing our hardware business. In Q3 we'll be turning the corner and in Q4, we expect the top line growth to go along with continually improving margins.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Larry. Robert, we'll go to the Q&A portion of the call now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Adam Holt of Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question is about Fusion. I was hoping I could drill in a little bit to what you're seeing there. Specifically, what are you seeing from customer adoption? What modules and services are your customers aggregating around? How are deal sizes tracking? What are some of the details you can give us about where you think you are in the Fusion cycle?","Lawrence J. Ellison","Okay. Well, we're seeing rapid growth in Fusion across-the-board in CRM and in HCM. We're at the stage where we're winning the majority of deals and competes against Workday. So probably our outstanding -- or the outstanding, most rapidly growing part of our Fusion suite, which you know is ERP, CRM and HCM, the most complete suite of cloud applications available from any supplier. We're beating Workday on [indiscernible] market. To give you examples, we're beating them in North America, and we're almost shutting them out in Europe. So it's very, very exciting. We're also -- we also are getting good wins against salesforce with our Fusion Sales automation product. Mark?","Mark V. Hurd","Yes. To add to Larry's comments, let's stay on HCM. We've got the advantage in most international markets to be the first mover. So we're in those markets before anybody. Our product is quite advanced and our wins, to Larry's point, internationally are just tremendous. So I won't go in any customer names. We've given you some in the past in Europe, but very rapid there. Our RightNow acquisition has been very significant. Again remember, a lot of RightNow was U.S.-based. We've now been capable -- or we've now taken it global. So our wins globally have been significant, same thing in CRM with sales automation. Our product is advancing. I read you some of the wins in the quarter, just it's been a rapid growth phase for us. And as I mentioned in my script, we're investing into it with more headcount. Our headcount now is growing in every region, and we have a strong belief that more headcount with a great product like what we've got means more growth.","Safra A. Catz","And of course as you know, we have nearly -- I guess we have more than 100 modules of Fusion. So we've got products and really most of the pillars are doing very well, and we've got customers implementing them right now.","Operator","We will go next to John DiFucci of JPMorgan.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is for Mark. Mark, it looks like Europe put up solid results this quarter. It was, again, the first relatively easy comp in a while. But nevertheless, double-digit growth doesn't really fit with what we continue to generally hear about the region. Can you talk a little bit about what happened in the region, and how sustainable that kind -- those kinds of -- kind of results are?","Mark V. Hurd","Well I don't mean to be trite, but I think the only ones around that aren't surprised about Europe is us. We started investing frankly into Europe -- in headcount in Europe 1 year -- over 1 year ago, and it may seem counter to what most people -- the conventional wisdom is, but we decided to grow our headcount. As we've talked about globally, I mentioned the amount of scale we've got in headcount. We made a decision in Europe, and we hired up early. A lot of that headcount has now been in place 4 and 5 quarters -- 3, 4 and 5 quarters. We've seen pipeline result as a result of that. As a result, we have gained share. Our apps growth in Europe was extremely impressive this quarter. We gained share over SAP, and you've seen it happen multiple times. We have a very strong organization in Europe. I mentioned about the success of HCM in Europe and the quick start we've gotten over there. So we have a strong group there. I'm not going to tell you that we don't see the conversion rates. We see the pressure on the conversion rates, but we're in more deals than we've been before, and we see us in a position now where we are gaining significant share.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And if I might, just a quick follow-up for Safra. A question on cash flow. Second quarter is seasonally a low cash flow quarter, but the results this quarter were less than we were -- or at least within we had modeled. If you could just comment on that.","Safra A. Catz","Yes. Well, you have to look back, actually. At both Q4 and Q1, we had really excellent cash flows. As a result, the collections were very, very, very high. In fact, they were higher -- significantly higher than earnings. And so while we collected a lot -- so this quarter is just a little bit lower. And in addition, we had, gee, $400-plus million in tax payments, which impacts it. So that's really all there is.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And that's actually the delta between -- the $400 million's delta between what we were looking for in what you did.","Operator","We will go next to Kash Rangan of Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Mark, you made some comments regarding the sequential unit growth rate in Exadata, 70% sequential growth and a few other things that were discussed. Does this mean that you're tracking well towards the 100% goal that you outlined earlier for Engineered Systems and also the $1 billion run rate, or any puts and takes there? And I guess I have one question for you, Safra. The fiscal cliff, any comments there with respect to customer behavior as we go into the February quarter?","Mark V. Hurd","Well thanks, Kash. I would tell you from an aspirational perspective, we're changing nothing. Our objective is to double the Engineered Systems business. In various quarters, we may be above that or slightly below it. But generally speaking, that's a trajectory run, and you're going to see us keep pushing on that. So with that, I'll turn it over to Safra.","Safra A. Catz","Yes. Well as you can see in our numbers, folks wanted to spend their budget, continue to want to spend their budgets. We were having an absolutely wonderful December so far. So what's going on in Washington, I don't know who is necessarily influencing today. But I can tell you our customers are -- have been spending money with us even here in December.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's good to hear, Safra. I hope the debate continues in Washington, and we actively sell software.","Operator","And we will go next -- the next question is from Jason Maynard of Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I had a question about sales performance and productivity. There obviously were a lot of questions last quarter or so about changes of the sales force and sales headcount ramping. And now for 2 quarters in a row, new software license has done probably better than most on the street have expected. I'm curious, Mark, just to get your characterization in terms of productivity, ramping for those net new hires, and how are you feeling about the back half of the year in delivering, if you will, as you get at obviously your bigger Q4?","Mark V. Hurd","Well without making too many forward-looking statements, we\u2019re talking about Q2 and Q3 forecast but in general I think, Jason, we feel great. I mean we\u2019re a very attractive company in terms of attracting talent. So the first question is do I think the people we're hiring are great people? We think we're getting the best people in the industry, point one. Point two, we think we're very capable in doing a good job assimilating those people. As you know to your productivity ramp.  That's a big deal. How we train them, how we prepare them, how we get them oriented in terms of being -- getting them ready to sell and to beat competition. As we've talked before, we've lined up our sales force. We lined them up against our sector competitors. We specialize them. We train them to be experts in their products. As you know, that takes time. We generally plan on a 12-month ramp time for salespeople to come in and frankly not to be very productive. If they are productive, then frankly that's gravy for us. And we've seen ramps at, I would say, the speeds we expected or faster. And as a result, in some regions, I've mentioned 1 in Europe, I would say we have some other regions in the country that actually moved a little bit faster in hiring, and you see those show up in the pipeline and you show it up -- and you see it in the results that we're showing. So we feel great about the talent we're attracting. We feel great about the assimilation process. And I've got news for you, Jason, we're actually still hiring. So we plan to hire more because as we specialize the sales force, it actually creates a need for us to have more people. We're hiring in our verticals. We're hiring in cloud. We're hiring in every single region. And again I'll put out in this call, those of you that have talented people that are looking for a great company to join, please send us their resume because we're looking for great folks.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Yes, we're also hiring in BI. I'll give you a whole list.","Mark V. Hurd","It's true. I mean listen, I -- just to give you some kind of -- Larry mentioned BI. We've gone in some regions where we've more than doubled our headcount. By the way to be clear, that\u2019s in the poll [ph] structure we just gave you. So we've done some work to get some other things a little bit more efficient as we've done it, but we\u2019ve really ramped up. And so this is -- in our view, this is how you grow. When you have great products, you get great people out there representing the products in the industry.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Well, let me just say that I think Mark and his team in the field have done an extraordinary job of ramping the sales force without increasing sales expense. So we've dramatically improved the tooth-to-tail ratio of our field sales organization. And that is we've added salespeople and sales consultants while getting -- while downsizing some of the groups whose job was to help. So we've specialized our sales force, increased the size of our sales force, added sales consultants, added salespeople and have kept expenses pretty close to flat. So we have a lot more firepower right now in terms of our distribution -- organization, and we're going to keep doing that for at least the next 18 months. So again, we're going to do it very conservatively. We're going to add the capacity without adding the expense.","Operator","And we will go next to Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm just wondering, Mark, given all the enhancements you made with the release of Fusion, can you share with us the type of attach rates you're seeing of the add-ons that are not included in the maintenance payments people are making? And secondly, I guess given the success you're seeing in the cloud subscription revenue line, how should we think about this in terms of the software license update growth rate going forward, if at all, in terms of the impact it could have?","Mark V. Hurd","Okay. First, a lot of questions there, Heather. I think first in terms of modular attach, I mean these are very early days, right? So modular attach, in our view, is a long-term strategy. The fact that we would sell recruiting in HCM and then sell succession planning, maybe that even leads to core HR. So our attach rate, we looked at it over a number of years. I mean -- so for example in the quarter, we had some very significant logos, I read only a few of them, where we closed the module. And frankly as soon as we closed the module, we had a proposal for another one, another one, et cetera, et cetera. So it's a core part of our strategy in terms of attach, and I say that in terms of attach of module to module. Your question about subscription rate, and I think your point was -- I think you're trying to tell me, \"How should you think about the growth of it?\" And frankly, there's a couple of different dynamics to it, and I'm going to let Safra decide how we're going to talk to you about that because it's a combination of new annual recurring revenue...","Safra A. Catz","Right.","Mark V. Hurd","That we measure very closely. And then we measure renewal rates very closely, but they're frankly 2 separate metrics. And then there's a third metric, which is the expansion of an existing customer. So you've got both -- I've got the customer. I'm going to expand them, that's one opportunity. The second, I'm just going to renew the customer I've got. And then third, a net new logo, and the combination of those 3 create annual revenue. So that's how I'd say we think about it.","Safra A. Catz","Okay. So, Heather, I think what you're trying to get to is whether our software update number is going to slow down as people maybe","[Audio Gap]","from on-premise to cloud. And I think at this point where we are is that you actually have to kind of understand the scale of these things. Because as a general matter, folks who are already on-premise will buy some SaaS modules and -- as add-ons and to the extent that they are converting from one to the other. The first thing is, as a general matter, we always get more money, so first. Secondly, I want to just remind you that our support number, the thing we call software license and updates and product support, is $4.2 billion. In fact, the -- after the point number, the $260 million, that's actually bigger than our SaaS number. So let's say it's just not going to have a material impact. Our renewal rates remain extremely, extremely high and over the next -- it took us 30 years to get to $4.2 billion as customers convert. Well theoretically, it might not grow as quickly. But at this point, we've got a long way to go, I would say extremely bullish on our high, high renewal rates. So we expect that number to grow and our SaaS number grow simultaneously at much higher percentages because it's a smaller base.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Safra, from your comments, it sounded like you guys are seeing a year-end budget flush, which is pretty encouraging. Are you now seeing any changes in pricing or the pricing environment?","Safra A. Catz","Seems things are going very, very well, obviously. Things are going well. Folks want to close deals. Folks want to close deals in November. They want to continue to close deals now in December. It's new. It's good. So far, so good. No negative impact on pricing. Pricing remains very good for us all around. Remember we have the deepest, broadest product line in the industry. Really, no one has everything we have. And as a result customers, when they come and buy from us, they often buy many things. And as a result, I think they're happy with our pricing, and we're happy with their purchases.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Mark Murphy of Piper Jaffray.","Mark R. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","From what you've described, it sounds like the Database business is performing well and that has really been no letup there. But the 12c product cycle is coming here soon, and we've heard it described as a very big leap forward. So I'm just wondering how should we think about the impact of 12c -- of that product cycle in terms of what it means, both for the industry and also for your Database revenue growth?","Lawrence J. Ellison","Well, I think the big component of 12c is the fact that the first database is really designed for the cloud. In other words, we've moved the multi-tenancy feature out of the application and down into the database layer, which gives people much better capability, much better security. And we think a lot of people who -- a lot of companies like salesforce.com [indiscernible], our customers will want to take advantage of Oracle 12c. It will make their businesses much more efficient. It will make their customers much more secure and much more reliable. They'll get better performance and so on. So we think it will greatly enhance our own cloud offering. We think it's very attractive to our customers who are putting in their own private clouds. So our enterprise customers are often -- are installing private clouds rather than doing more traditional database implementations in their data centers. So the key component -- or the key feature of Oracle 12c is the fact that it moves multi-tenancy down into the database layer. We think it will help our cloud business. It will help all of the cloud companies that depend on the Oracle Database. And it will be very, very attractive to our enterprise customers. So I think it will drive growth. It will drive growth of the Oracle Database for the next several years.","Safra A. Catz","Yes. I wouldn't model anything short term into it because as you know, our customers who are paying for license updates and product support are entitled to the product as part of that and over time, they upgrade to it over multiple years. But because of the additional features, we do think that it makes us even more competitive, and we actually expect to continue to gain market share as we have for the past 20 years.","Mark V. Hurd","Yes. Just on the quarter too on the Database business, we had big growth -- we've good solid growth in every region. And we did it across not just the core database, but also our options. And we've had a release of Enterprise Manager that's had quite a positive impact too. We've had solid growth in Enterprise Manager. So when you look across every region and you look across each of the 3 core elements of our database business, we had strong growth in the quarter.","Operator","And we will take our final question today from Brad Reback of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Brad R. Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Mark, you mentioned during the prepared remarks that verticals were up about 60% year-over-year. Could you give us some color around that? Is that a function of just the increased coverage, products taking market share?","Mark V. Hurd","Yes. I think -- I mean listen, we've put a lot of effort into our verticals. We're a strong believer as a team in this strategy that when we actually solve a customer's problem, their business problem, those are discussions we're having at the CEO level.  And the implication it has strategically for us as well as the customer is huge. So not only do we get the opportunity to get that growth in the vertical business that you're describing, but the pull it has across our entire product line is material. So I think in addition, we've invested a lot of R&D. We've made some acquisitions. We feel great about our position in communications, our position in retail. Our performance in retail has been outstanding, just outstanding. The implications it had across our entire product line has been profound in terms of just the growth that it's driven. We've made big investments in Financial Services, big investments not just in product but also in scaling out our sales force. So those 3 are very big industries in terms of just the total spend. Financial Services is probably the biggest when you take manufacturing about from being sort of segmented into multiple industries. And so those 3 have been very big for us. We've made investments in utilities, which we saw growth in utilities again in the quarter. We've seen growth in healthcare in the quarter as well. And then I would say overall, just to finish it, we've had --  we've invested in growth. Our pipelines are up. And not only we feel good about the quarter, we're optimistic about the verticals as we go forward as well.","Operator","That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back to Ken Bond for closing remarks.","Ken Bond","Thank you, operator. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours.

Ken?","Ken Bond","Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s second quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz.","As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements.","These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.","And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. But before I start, I\u2019d like to acknowledge and thank you all for the many, many sincere condolences we received upon Mark\u2019s passing. Thank you. They mean a lot to us.","As you can see, we had another solid quarter. This quarter, we finished with total revenue growth within my guidance range and EPS at the high-end. Cloud Services and License Support continue to see material growth, and given that it represents more than 70% of our total revenue, it more than offsets declines in some smaller non-strategic businesses. We continue to be encouraged that our overall revenue growth will further accelerate, as we reach the final stages of this ongoing shift in business mix.","Of late, I\u2019ve been spending much more time with customers. The overriding theme I hear is the compelling nature of our technology and how it is critical to the success of their businesses: feature-rich, simple, secure, performant and priced right. They see Oracle as being strategic to their ongoing operations, and they tell me repeatedly that Oracle is the right partner to run their mission-critical assets, both in the cloud and on-premise. Their comments reinforce our conviction that our product strategy is right.","At Oracle, we\u2019ve upgraded our internal systems to the cloud, and we are sharing our experience with customers by describing the stunning benefits and efficiencies that can be realized from the move and know we have thousands of customers and references, our own experience, adopting Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure allows us to serve as a unique and knowledgeable adviser to customers who want to know how to go about their own digital transformation.","To give you some context, let me share just a few of the many benefits we are seeing in our business. With Fusion ERP Cloud, we are now able to close our books and report earnings in 12 days or less. Many companies don\u2019t report their results for weeks. And not only can we get our results out faster, but we\u2019ve saved money, too.","By using the AI and processes in Fusion ERP Cloud, we have been able to eliminate more than 30% of our manual accounting activities. And enabled by Fusion HCM Cloud, we have seen employee satisfaction levels soar with all-time high rates for things like hiring and onboarding new employees.","We\u2019ve also made it easier for our managers and employees, as Fusion HCM reduces the time needed to complete the talent review process by more than 70%. And separately, we\u2019re saving more than 20,000 hours of manager time each year with our accelerated job offer process.","In sales, we\u2019re using our front-office cloud platform, augmented with machine learning and our own Data Cloud to help our salespeople sell more and sell more quickly. With Marketing Cloud, campaign planning now takes days rather than weeks. And with built-in machine learning, we\u2019ve seen a doubling in lead conversion.","We automatically capture millions of activities in Sales Cloud each year. And with CPQ Cloud, ordering is much faster and easier, with over 70% of our transactions fully automated. We needed that to handle the increased volumes of transactions as a result of our customers move to the cloud.","In addition, we\u2019ve adopted the Gen2 Infrastructure, including Autonomous Database for our custom apps. Our internal IT costs to run these systems are down by millions, while at the same time, we are adopting more than 100 new features each quarter.","Here at Oracle, we are going to continue using our own cloud technology as an intelligent automation engine and continue to simplify our business model and processes. In turn, I expect that our revenue growth rates will increase and see even more expense efficiencies. And as a result, I expect that you will see us expand our margins and grow EPS double digits for the foreseeable future.","Now on to the numbers. I\u2019ll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. Currency Q \u2013 for Q2 was largely in line with my guidance at nearly 1%, and the fact that the growth rates look the same in a few categories is simply because of rounding.","Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3%, accounting for over 70% of total company revenues and most of this is recurring revenue. Cloud and on-premise license revenues were $1.1 billion, down 7%, as more of our GBU customers order cloud instead of license.","In terms of ecosystem, GAAP application ecosystem revenues were $2.9 billion, up 4%, with Fusion apps up in the low-30%s, including Fusion ERP up 38% and Fusion HCM up 23%. NetSuite ERP was up 28%. Vertical SaaS was up low double digits, while Data Cloud stabilized. On a trailing 12 months basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is recurring.","GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $5 billion, up 1%, with total database revenue up 1%, highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up over 200%. But off a small base for now, on a trailing 12-month basis, more than three quarters of our infrastructure ecosystem revenue is recurring.","Just a few days ago, we were able to get our first Gen2 Exadata Cloud@Customer fully deployed and connected. It was done in just four days. Previously, with our Gen1 architecture, this typically took significantly longer. As a result, we are very optimistic about the impact our Gen2 Cloud@Customer will have on our business. No other cloud provider has the right technology to actually do this.","In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in SaaS revenue in all regions except EMEA, with especially strong results in Latin America and Japan. Gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 85%, down slightly from last quarter due to accelerated investments in our Gen2 Cloud to address higher demand worldwide.","As we get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will grow higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth. By the way, our strategic hardware products delivered on-premise, which includes Exadata, grew double digits for the quarter, once again showing that our installed base of customers focused on our world-leading database platform continues to grow.","Total revenue for the quarter were $9.6 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4 billion, essentially unchanged from last year and operating margin was 42%, down from 43% last year.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% and EPS was $0.90 in USD, up 13% in constant currency and 12% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 17.7% and GAAP EPS was $0.69 in USD, up 15% in constant currency, 14% in USD. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last four quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $12.2 billion.","We now have approximately $27 billion in cash and marketable securities and short-term net deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Also, the prior year deferred balance was affected by our transition to ASC 606. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3%, if not for the ASC 606 transition changes.","We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 91 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve repurchased nearly 500 million shares for a total of $26 billion. And over the last five years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share.","My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency, assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now. Currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS. So for Q3, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency and assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in USD.","Now I realize that my USD and constant currency revenue guidance sound like they\u2019re the same number, but it\u2019s just rounding similar to our revenue growth this quarter. I do expect a currency impact of 1% \u2013 of nearly 1%.","Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.96 and $0.98 in constant currency. And assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 9% and 11% and between \u2013 and be between $0.95 and $0.97 in USD.","Total CapEx for fiscal year 2020 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move higher based on demand for data center growth. My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal year 2020 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for those one-time tax benefits \u2013 the tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% in fiscal year 2020.","And finally, for fiscal year 2020, I continue to expect that in constant currency, total revenue will grow faster than last year and that we will report double-digit EPS growth for the year.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry for his comments.","Lawrence Ellison","Thank you, Safra. As I\u2019ve said before, there are two key product areas that will determine Oracle\u2019s future in the cloud, Cloud ERP Applications and the Autonomous Database. Being the clear number one in both of these two giant applications and infrastructure market segments, we\u2019ll enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments. This is already happening in applications.","We have a huge lead in Cloud ERP, with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 20,000 NetSuite ERP customers. Our closest Cloud ERP competitors, Workday, and they claim to have a few 100 ERP customers.","Workday\u2019s lack of success in Cloud ERP is creating opportunities for Oracle in Cloud HCM. More and more, we\u2019re seeing HCM as being purchased as a part of an ERP cloud application suite. As a result, today, we have more HCM customers than Workday. And we\u2019re beginning to see that same integrated suite strategy beginning to drive our sales of CX customer experience applications in sales and service and in marketing.","SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. As a result, SAP\u2019s installed base is very vulnerable. We\u2019ve already replaced and successfully migrated many midsized SAP customers from SAP to Fusion ERP.","Importantly, a few months from now, in Q1 calendar year 2020, one of SAP\u2019s biggest customers will go live on Fusion ERP. Many of SAP\u2019s largest customers are already working with us to develop plans to migrate the Fusion ERP. SAP\u2019s customer base is up for grabs. They didn\u2019t rewrite their applications for the cloud. That has created an enormous opportunity for Oracle.","We\u2019re already declared number one in the Cloud ERP market as measured in market share and our Cloud ERP business is already growing at a rate of over 30%. By offering a safe and compelling alternatives to SAP\u2019s old technology, we can increase our applications growth rate far beyond that 30%. We\u2019re very, very comfortable that we will be the overwhelming winner in this generation Cloud ERP business.","Now, let\u2019s look at some application wins in the quarter. Advance Publications, a media company, bought ERP, Albertsons got ERP, EPM and supply chain. C.H. Robinson, Worldwide, a transportation company, bought ERP and EPM. DHL Supply Chain, big German company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Edwards Lifesciences, a medical equipment company, bought ERP.","By the way, I\u2019m not mentioning any HCM \u2013 associated HCM deals, because I have a separate list for HCM. So a lot of these guys, maybe next quarter, I will put the HCM deals right next to the ERP deal. So you can see, because you\u2019ll \u2013 I\u2019ll be repeating a lot of these names when I get to my HCM list, and that\u2019s the point I made earlier that people are now looking at HCM as just another module that we need in the back-office, very important.","Edwards Lifesciences bought ERP. Ferguson, a manufacturing firm, bought ERP and supply chain. Global Companies, big energy firm, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NCR, financial services, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NETSCOUT, telecommunications company, bought supply chain. Mutual Life Assurance bought ERP and supply chain. Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, big energy company, bought ERP. Technip, another energy company, bought ERP.","By the way, SAP is supposed to be very strong in energy. Texas Children\u2019s Healthcare, the hospital bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Unilever bought ERP and supply chain. Baker Hughes, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Carlson Wagonlit Travel services, ERP, EPM and supply chain. Kuwait Petroleum, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Liberty Global, communications company, ERP, EPM and supply chain.","Manpower, the global services company bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Sherwin-Williams, that\u2019s what they bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. The suite, a lot of people are buying multiple modules, it\u2019s not just ERP, it\u2019s ERP. It\u2019s EPM, Enterprise Performance Management. It\u2019s supply chain. It\u2019s manufacturing. Bank of New York Mellon bought ERP, EPM and supply chain.","Airport Terminal Services \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, now I\u2019m on my HCM Group. I\u2019m in the HCM Group, they\u2019re all grouped together. Airport Terminal Services bought HCM. Apparel Bosco Retail, HCM. Banque Saudi Fransi bought HCM. CenterPoint Energy, other energy company, bought HCM. Cummins, manufacturing company, HCM. Graybar Electric bought HCM. Hologic, HCM. HUS at the hospital, both of the hospitals in Finland, run by the federal government in Finland bought HCM.","Mountaire Farms, HCM. North Atlantic Refining, again, this is my HCM list, big energy company, an SAP stronghold in the energy sector bought HCM from us. Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, big gas company, Energy, HCM. Technip, energy company, HCM. Tenet Healthcare bought HCM. Texas Children\u2019s Hospital bought HCM and [indiscernible] brought HCM. Birmingham City Council bought HCM. Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, a big energy bought HCM.","MEDNAX Health Care, HCM. Phoenix Life Holdings, HCM. In customer experience, Equinix bought service. Ferguson Enterprises bought service. Ferrari bought sales and marketing. IKYA bought service. Nordstrom bought service. PayPal bought marketing. Rabobank bought service and Santander Bank bought service.","Okay, let me move on to the other segment, which is Autonomous Database and Gen2 Infrastructure. In the database market, we are the overwhelming number one, with a combination of a dominant share on-premise and very strong market share in the cloud, though, I have yet to see any good data on database market share in the cloud.","Our database business is growing very, very rapidly, because we have an enormous technology advantage in the cloud over all of our competitors with Autonomous Database. Autonomous Database is the world\u2019s only Autonomous Database. What does that mean? That means, when you configure the system, you don\u2019t do anything. The system configures itself. Robots configure the system.","The recent Capital One lost all that data at AWS is, because one of the Capital One people made a configuration here. You can\u2019t make configuration errors with the Autonomous Database, because human beings don\u2019t configure the system. A lot of these above the fold headlines of people losing their data are caused by human errors. People forget the patch systems. Remember that one. They patched some, but not all of the systems.","And Equifax, Equifax it was a patchy stocks [ph] database, didn\u2019t get patched. They didn\u2019t find them all. Guess what? Autonomous Database automatically patches itself when a security flaw is detected And by the way, they detected that security flow at Equifax. They knew about it. They just didn\u2019t get around to patching. Patching is hard. They have to find all the databases. You had to schedule downtime. You don\u2019t schedule downtime with the Autonomous Database.","You can\u2019t see Autonomous Database, while the database is still running. But you don\u2019t capture database. The robots, our robots attach the database. That\u2019s why it\u2019s Autonomous. There\u2019s no human labor. So there\u2019s no human error. So if you are willing to pay less and not have that human labor, you get rid of all those mistakes. This is a gigantic technology advantage, by the way, and we\u2019re ten times faster than anything Amazon apps.","That means, we\u2019re much cheaper than anything Amazon has. Much safer, much easier to use, build applications faster. So we already have thousands of Autonomous Database customers running in our Public Cloud. We added 2,000 more this quarter. And our Autonomous business, as Safra said, is growing in excess of 200%, Autonomous Database business off a small base. Admittedly, it\u2019s a relatively new product, but it\u2019s on its way to being the most successful new product introduction in our company\u2019s history.","Now this triple-digit growth rate, I expect will spike up dramatically because of another thing Safra just mentioned. Our introduction of our Autonomous Database Cloud@Customer, Gen2 Cloud@Customer. Now, when people can start putting Autonomous Database, they\u2019re already \u2013 I mean, all our Autonomous Database customers, let me be clear, are in our Public Cloud.","A lot of our customers, especially those in regulated markets, big banks, people \u2013 government agencies, defense ministries, people have that. They need the Autonomous Database capabilities behind their firewall in their data center. And next \u2013 and over the next few months, we\u2019re rolling out this Autonomous Database Gen2 Cloud@Customer.","Now all of our cloud competitors are trying to create these outposts of their cloud on the floor \u2013 on the floors of their customers. We actually have it working. And in fact, we\u2019re in our second-generation of this. We did it early. We did a reasonable first-generation job, but the second time is a charm. And this new Gen2 stuff was \u2013 can be installed in a day. No, the first one we installed in four days.","We expect to do that even faster. There\u2019ll be more time spent unpacking the hardware and plugging it in than readying the software, because it just syncs up with our Public Cloud and you\u2019re up and running. This is going to be a huge opportunity for us to dramatically increase the adoption rate on Autonomous Database, very excited about that.","The \u2013 okay. The \u2013 when that happens, we think by any measure, we will be not only have the overwhelming market share lead on-prem, but the overwhelming market share lead in the cloud. We expect to hold onto our database franchise in a big way. So it\u2019s interesting that both of our Autonomous Database and our cloud applications are running in our new Gen2 highly secured infrastructure.","And by the end of 2020, by the end of next calendar year, this time next year, I\u2019ll be able to say that we have more Gen2 data centers in more countries than Amazon Web Services has data centers period. We\u2019re adding lots and lots of data centers in lots and lots of countries. And, again, we\u2019ll have more data centers in more countries than Amazon by the end \u2013 a year from now, that\u2019s very, very exciting.","Now, let\u2019s look at some of our Autonomous Database in Gen2 Infrastructure wins this quarter. Okay. [indiscernible] international big manufacturing firm. Albertson\u2019s, this another \u2013 this is more synergy that I\u2019ve got to mention where people buy our applications. They buy our ERP applications. They also build data warehouses associated with those applications. They do a lot of work.","So a lot of our application customers are beginning to be infrastructure \u2013 Autonomous Database customers and infrastructure customers. So, yes, when you buy ERP, you might also by HCM. When you buy ERP, you\u2019re also going to buy the Fusion Data Warehouse, which is an Autonomous Database product and Infrastructure product.","You\u2019re going to buy analytics in our Gen2 data center. You\u2019re going to be an infrastructure customer, as well as an application customer and we see a lot of overlap. We often see see people buying suites of applications, ERP, plus HCM, plus sales and things like that. But also applications plus infrastructure. Aon Financial Services. Biogen bought Autonomous Data Warehouse. Cisco Systems, again, Gen2 Infrastructure and Autonomous Data Warehouse.","Clearstream services, same thing, Gen2 Infrastructure Autonomous Data Warehouse. Embraer Aviation, the Brazilian airplane \u2013 the aircraft manufacturer, Autonomous Database and Gen2 Infrastructure. Equity Bank of Kenya, Autonomous Database, Gen2 Infrastructure.

Thank you, Larry. Holly, if you could please prepare the audience for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Michael Turits, Raymond James.","Michael Turits","Hey, good evening, everybody. Safra, it was great to see that you reaffirmed your guidance for the full-year per revenue acceleration and double-digit EPS growth. But with the 3Q guide, it does suggest a very strong fourth-quarter on top of what was the fourth \u2013 strong fourth quarter than last year. So can you give us a little bit of visibility into what\u2019s driving that confidence.? And also I know it\u2019s early, but given what that means for fourth quarter, what does it mean in terms of what it implies about fiscal 2021?","Safra Catz","So we\u2019ve got everything finally out and available. And as Larry and I both mentioned, we\u2019ve got Cloud@Customer. We have a lot of orders for that, that we have not deployed yet. So we\u2019ve got a lot of demand there. We\u2019ve got Autonomous Database. We\u2019ve got new versions of Autonomous Database on track. We\u2019ve got the entire Fusion suite rolling even \u2013 including all of the additional modules have all been continuously upgraded.","So we\u2019ve got an immense amount of demand. And we have enormous pipelines and our conversion rates are increasing. And so the pipe has just expanded so dramatically than I know we\u2019re going to have more bookings, but also previous bookings as those deals are ramping up and more users are using the products were very, very upbeat about the second-half. But even more so next year, we believe that the momentum we will have in the second-half of this year will more than carry through to 2021.","Michael Turits","Great. Thanks very much.","Safra Catz","Sure.","Operator","And our next question is going to come from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you so much for the time and I\u2019m going to try and get away with two questions. But I guess, the first one, Safra, as you mentioned about license this quarter, it was a little lighter than what, I think, people were expecting. I know we\u2019re talking about a big base. But if there\u2019s anything you could call out in terms of whether it\u2019s the sales force reorg or just macro or whatever in terms of the results in the quarter on that line.","And then I know just covering the company for a while, given the lumpiness historically between Q2 and Q3, I know sometimes deals push from one quarter to the next and typically, it\u2019s better to just average those two quarters. But how do you feel about the outlook for the Q3 license number? And then I just have one follow-up, if you don\u2019t mind.","Safra Catz","I generally feel very good about the Q3 license number, as you said, it is lumpy. The one thing we do have is that the GBUs, which, of course, not a giant part of our license business, but are significant. They have moved and their cloud products have become available. And I do expect that most of the orders for new services in the GBUs will come through as Cloud Services instead of just plain License. But I don\u2019t think that will be as significant. I do expect that licenses, in fact, will be just fine in Q3 other than the GBU piece.","Heather Bellini","Okay. And then just my follow-up. I mean, these calls just still don\u2019t feel the same without Mark being on them. And with all due respect to him to his passing just knowing how hard it is going to be to replace him, I mean, is there anything to share with us regarding you getting some \u2013 getting someone to kind of help take his place in some of the responsibilities that you\u2019ve taken over?","Lawrence Ellison","Okay. This is Larry. I know how to answer that question, because I get the question is, so how\u2019s our search for a second CEO guy? Remember, when we announced two CEOs, the first time was people thought that was a bit odd. And so now people are finding that we have one CEO is a bit odd, two CEOs \u2013 so it\u2019s so simple. So let me make it very simple. How\u2019s our search going for the new \u2013 for a second CEO, we don\u2019t have plans. We have no plans for having a second CEO, it was an unusual situation, where Mark and Safra were an absolutely fantastic team.","But we have complete confidence in our existing management team. We\u2019re doing a lot of recruiting and you\u2019ll see a lot of announcements at the next layer down that we\u2019re hiring a bunch of people at the next layer down who are potential CEOs, when both Safra and I retire and which is not anytime soon. And so we\u2019re going to strengthen the management team, but one of the strategies for strengthening that team is not to hire a second CEO.","Heather Bellini","Thank you very much.","Ken Bond","Next question, please. Thank you, Heather.","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse.","Brad Zelnick","Great. Thanks so much. Larry, the momentum in Autonomous Database is fantastic, growing over a 100% in your Public Cloud. But having been in market now for over a year, I know investors are wondering when we might see an inflection in your financial results from Autonomous. And I appreciate many customers are including some of the required database option in their deals. But now that you\u2019re making it available on Gen2 Cloud@Customer. How should we think about the appetite from your installed base? How material can it be to your financials? And is there anything you might compare it to in Oracle\u2019s history?","Lawrence Ellison","Well, no. I mean, there \u2013 either in terms of a technological breakthrough. Well, I guess, we\u2019re the first commercial relational database.","Brad Zelnick","Wow.","Lawrence Ellison","The very beginning, that\u2019s kind of created Oracle Corporation, right? So that we had the very first commercial relational database. We had one before IBM did or anyone else did. So that traded \u2013 that turned this company from an idea into the company that manages most of the world\u2019s information.","So I would say, Autonomous Database is that same kind of thing. It\u2019s \u2013 it is so much different, so much favored to use, so much more reliable than anything else that\u2019s in the market. I think everyone is going to use it. Virtually, everyone is going to use it.","Now that said, it is \u2013 it takes a while when you introduce an all new products. The good news is, we have a huge installed base here. It takes a while for that \u2013 for us to shift a, if you will, a next-gen technology and get people comfortable with it and using it. And that first year, we\u2019ve seen a lot of early adopters. But the early adopters are now in the thousands. And we think eventually the only database will offer, it\u2019s Autonomous Database. It will replace everything else.","And by the way, at Autonomous Database, it\u2019s only available in Q4. If we put a cloud in \u2013 if we put our cloud in your data center, that\u2019s our Exadata machine and our Middleware machines and all of that is in our storage in your data center and our Public Cloud. So it \u2013 we think it will be consumed in one of those two ways and that will replace our entire base.","So it means that our existing database business from a financial standpoint will more than double or triple or triple probably is a reasonable estimate to look out. Now, of course, when you are in your business, it\u2019s all about timing. And I wish I could tell you exactly how much will sell over the next 18 months. That\u2019s kind of tricky. Now we don\u2019t have that many data points. We have four quarters of data points. And then the first couple of quarters, it was so new. So we really only have a couple of quarters of data points. All I\u2019ve been saying is none of us ever seen an adoption rate like this before.","Brad Zelnick","Fantastic. Thank you, Larry.","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Phil Winslow, Wells Fargo.","Phil Winslow","Hi, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to focus in on the applications business. Obviously, you saw a nice tick back up here quarter-to-quarter in terms of the year-over-year growth rate. I guess, the question to Safra and I guess, Larry, too. What do you think about the sort of the different curves that buildup that business? Obviously, you\u2019ve talked about in the past some of the headwinds from things like Data Cloud and then also some of the wins that we saw on your Fusion, Fusion ERP and NetSuite this quarter?","Where are we when we stack all those curves together? Are we past for those headwinds and we\u2019re now looking at sort of acceleration from here? In other words, Q1 was a trough or just help us kind of, Larry, take that up, if you could?","Safra Catz","So let me get started and then Larry can add when he needs to add. So first of all, the Data Cloud has stabilized. I don\u2019t know if it will stay that way, but that was a very significant headwind for us. In that whole business, it has completely stabilized. It grew ever so slightly.","Additionally, the adoption in our ERP Cloud is now such that it\u2019s in the thousands. We\u2019ve many, many references. And what happens in our business is that, once you are sort of obviously referenceable, it becomes much, much easier for other potential customers to move ahead.","One of the things that had been to some extent leading to a wait-and-see attitude by some historically business suite customers was the adoption of first availability and now adoption of supply chain. Our supply chain now has many, many customers, and so more of our customers are willing and interested in moving.","Remember, every single quarter, a 100-plus new features become available. And some of those have been must-have features for extremely happy customers in the business suite. Simultaneously, as Larry mentioned, SAP customers have realized that SAPs\u2019 offerings are not cloud offerings. If you use SAP\u2019s technology, you don\u2019t get a 100 new features every quarter.","There\u2019s a simply a hosted offering, which means that we are the obvious choice for customers who are \u2013 who want to go through and really adopt a digital approach in their business. And so for us, this is going to be success leads more success. It\u2019s an incredibly virtuous cycle. And as Larry mentioned, what it also means is that additional modules are going with and that\u2019s clearly showing up in our other segments and, of course, HCM, which is obviously a match and then ultimately, the front-office, where we\u2019ve got a lot of new technology rolling out that is being adopted.","Lawrence Ellison","Yes. I think a lot of SAP\u2019s \u2013 again, in the mid-market, where we are replacing a lot of SAP customers and we\u2019ve got them live and we have references. But right at the very impacts of SAP\u2019s customer base, they\u2019re top 50 customers around the world. They\u2019re \u2013 looking at this one particular implementation that where we expect to go live in March of next year.","And I would describe them as rooting for us. They want to have an alternative to a billion-dollar SAP upgrade. SAP end-of-life, their current stuff in 2025. So if you\u2019re a big SAP customer, you\u2019ve got to make it \u2013 that some people have bought \u2013 actually bought ahead, actually bought as we\u2019re having in the cloud with no plan \u2013 with no really good plan to implement it. It\u2019s a five-year implementation. They\u2019re getting price quotes of a billion-dollars for the upgrade.","Imagine going from your existing SAP system, taking out Oracle and replacing HANA and that\u2019s the only change. Basically, that\u2019s the only change and it\u2019s hosted. It\u2019s not cloud. There is no cloud. Anyway, I want to say, well, it\u2019s easy for Oracle and say, go to SAP\u2019s website and try to find the SAP Cloud for ERP. I mean, you can find it for the stuff they bought. You can find it for Callidus, which is on one cloud.","You can find it for Ariba, which is on another cloud. You can find it for little SurveyMonkey, and all the stuff that they bought. But they forgot. They forgot to write ERP, that\u2019s your business and they forgot to rewrite ERP there. There are projects that they had to do that whole business by design fails, they canceled it.","So there is no cloud option for SAP customers. They can\u2019t go to Workday. Workday can\u2019t even handle mid-market ERP. So we\u2019re at \u2013 so believe me, they want an alternatives to SAP, makes sense, right, that they should want an alternative. But we\u2019ve just got to demonstrate that we can safely take these enormous companies to the cloud in a way that they\u2019re not putting their business than any risks. And that\u2019s why this one particular giant implementation they\u2019re watching closely.","But by the way, they\u2019re not just watching and waiting. A number of their biggest customers in the heart of German, lots of them are working with \u2013 these are German customers the core of SAP are working with us. And taking some of their \u2013 moving some of their divisions already on some of their divisions to Oracle\u2019s Fusion to persuade themselves that we can do this safely. They\u2019ve gone that far. They don\u2019t want to continue with its obsolete code.","This is \u2013 this opportunity is gigantic, because we have one European customer on \u2013 competitor on-premise. They don\u2019t have a cloud offering. That\u2019s SAP. And we\u2019ve got one ERP Cloud competitor that just as not doing very well, having a hard time getting their business off the ground. It doesn\u2019t scale there a lot. There are a lot of problems.","So we have a chance here to be \u2013 to get what used to be in the old world called gates share for ERP and getting \u2013 like Microsoft Office to be \u2013 the Microsoft Office of ERP, where \u2013 and it\u2019s sitting there. And we just have to get this last proof point out to SAP\u2019s largest customers. Yes, we can do this. We can do it safely. And we will be overwhelmingly the largest application company in the cloud.","Phil Winslow","Thank you, Larry.","Ken Bond","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Moerdler, Sanford Bernstein.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you very much for taking my questions. Autonomous Database sounds like, it\u2019s really starting to gain traction. Given the shift of sales personnel to selling Autonomous, can you give us some more color specifically? Specifically, are you seeing the customers buying the required modules as license or they including it with the cloud? Are you seeing changes in the size of the customer, size of the pipeline, the time it takes from customer interest to adoption. Any of that would be really appreciated?","Lawrence Ellison","Okay, I\u2019m happy to do that. I think the most interesting thing that\u2019s going on is, we\u2019ve decided to take, if you will, in AWS approach to selling Autonomous Database in the cloud. So we almost prefer selling our $30,000 deal to a $100,000 deal, because in a $30,000 deal, we can close in four weeks.","So we think the way to sell Autonomous Database is to get it installed on a project in one of our customers, get it going, help them become successful. And then once they under \u2013 once they actually get their hands on Autonomous Database and they have working app, they have working projects, working data warehouses, working transaction processing systems, you start some new land and expand.","So we\u2019re selling thousands and thousands of small deals. And some of those deals are already coming back as larger deals. But our approach, again, is to \u2013 and most of it is not BYOL, because they\u2019re small. I mean some of it is. Not \u2013 yes, some of it is BYOL, but the majority is not BYOL. It was interesting in the early days in ERP.","When we had ERP, people moving our e-business suite customers. No, they were new logos. In the early days in Cloud ERP for us, they were new logos. Believe it or not, we\u2019re actually seeing new logos and database. But again, most of them are our customers, but they\u2019re not using their existing licenses. They\u2019re going ahead and using a standard cloud and license, what we call [indiscernible]. They pay us as we get. You pay for what you use.","I mean, it\u2019s the promise of the cloud. And we\u2019re getting in thousands of these, because we think the best selling techniques for Autonomous Database is try it, get it running, watch it backs itself up. It upgrades itself. It tunes itself. It configures itself. There\u2019s nothing like it.","We just got to win those hearts and minds. And the way to do that is go wide across our entire customer base. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on. And again, it\u2019s working very, very well. I think it\u2019s working very, very well, because we\u2019re seeing just beginning to see the first people coming back and going from $30,000 a month to $600,000 a month.","Ken Bond","Great. Next question, please?","Operator","Our final question for today will come from the line of Kirk Materne, Evercore.","Stewart Kirk Materne","Yes. Thanks very much and thanks for taking the question. Safra, I was just wondering if you could comment on just sort of the geographic landscape for you all. It looked like Europe was perhaps a little bit softer in your other geographies this quarter. Maybe that\u2019s just macro. I was wondering if you could just add a little bit color on sort of what you\u2019re seeing across the different theaters? Thanks.","Safra Catz","Yes. This quarter, EMEA only grew in the single digits. Some of the other regions did grow in the high double digits, some very high double digits. And I think there\u2019s nothing really special going on one way or the other. Some of it\u2019s just the way the quarter falls out for them. But overall, our business remains very strong. And I think that next quarter could be completely different.","So it was \u2013 it\u2019s really nothing. We\u2019re not seeing a massive change even month-over-month or quarter-over-quarter from what it looked like. Obviously, there are some regions doing very, very well for a number of different reasons as they get to roll out new capabilities. We\u2019ve got a lot of \u2013 we\u2019ve got data centers opening and have opened very, very successfully in Latin America and in Asia and in Japan.","And so we\u2019ve got a lot of usage and increase in some of those areas, which helped explain some of the big growth in some of those areas. But EMEA, I think, we will see \u2013 there\u2019s nothing special, in particular. I have no real color to add and we\u2019ll see what happens after today\u2019s selection in the UK.","Stewart Kirk Materne","Sounds good. Thank you.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Safra.

I'll then review guidance for Q3, and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.","Clearly we are very pleased with our results as hardware and total revenue were both above my CD guidance while total software was up at the high end. Cloud grew 47% on premise software license and support grew 6%, hardware systems grew 4% and total revenue grew 7% in constant currency.","The as-reported numbers were heavily impacted by the strengthening of the US dollar in comparison to other currencies. Total revenue saw a 4% currency headwind which was double to what it was at the time of my guidance. Software and Cloud as well as hardware system saw a growth rate affected by 3%. Currencies continue to move significantly. So my comments today are generally going to reflect constant dollar growth rates.","Total Cloud revenue was 590 million growing 47% with Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue of 364 million, up 41% from last year and more than double last year's growth.","The cloud bookings from several quarters is now helping drive SaaS and PaaS revenue growth. When bookings turn into revenue, depends on many factors. But as I reviewed the numbers over the last few quarter one thing is clear, the acceleration in the business bodes very well for our future.","Cloud infrastructure as a service revenue was 155 million, up 62% but due in part to prior year compares being low. Overall our Cloud results were better than expected as we are clearly growing faster than sales force and were more than three times the size of Workday.","Our goal remains to be bigger and grow faster in the cloud in both companies while improving our already high level of profitability. Total software revenues were 7.3 billion up 8% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove nearly half of total company revenue at 4.8 billion, up 9% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing install base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were $2 billion. ","Looking at GAAP software and Cloud results by region, the Americas grew 8% with North America database growing double digits and very strong Cloud growth, AMEA grew 9% with Cloud growth of more than 80% and Asia Pacific grew 7% powered by Japan.","Overall the hardware business including hardware support grew 4% with hardware system product revenue of 717 million and hardware support revenue of 690 million.","Our engineered systems saw solid growth with particular strength in both Exalogic and big data appliance as we continue to gain share.","For the company total revenue for the quarter was 9.6 billion, up 7% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was 4.4 billion also up 7% from last year, and the operating margin was unchanged at 46%. Excluding MICROS, both hardware gross margin and operating margin expanded by more than 1% that we were able to maintain our industry leading operating margins with MICROS now part of the business while growing our Cloud business 47% is a testimony to the strength of our business model.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% that's higher than my guidance of 23% and EPS was $0.69 in US dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 23.5%, a point higher than my guidance and GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.56 in US dollars.","The higher tax rate reduced EPS for both GAAP and non-GAAP by a cent. This was a result of revenue mix by region driven primarily by foreign currency impact and a couple of other small factors.","Free cash flow over the last four quarters was down very slightly at 14.5 billion as we increased CapEx spending a little bit. Just so that you get a sense of the size here, CapEx spending over the last four quarters in about $150 million higher than that same four quarters the previous year.","We now have nearly 45 billion in cash and marketable securities net of debt our cash position's approximately 12 billion. As we've said before we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividends.","In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies as the right valuations and both are critically important.","This quarter we repurchased 52.8 million shares for a total of 2.1 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased more than 200 million shares for a total of 8.1 billion, paid out dividends of 2.1 billion for a total that is more than 70% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share.","Now to the guidance. As you can imagine we feel very good about our prospects and our performance. But I have to tell you I am always keeping an eye on the situation in the macro environment especially aboard. Additionally given the unusually high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect revenue by more than 4% and EPS by $0.04 if rates stay as they did -- as they are just about now, but as we just don't know how much.","I am going to provide constant currency guidance today. SaaS and PaaS on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 30% to 34% in constant currency. On a GAAP basis SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 31% to 35%, Cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 29% to 33%, software and Cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis including SaaS and PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support is expected to grow between 5% to 8%. Hardware system revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis which includes hardware system products and hardware system support is expected to be somewhere between negative 2 and positive 8 in constant currency.","Total revenue growth on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 4% to 8%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.69 to $0.74, again all this in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.55 and $0.60.","Now this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 23% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% but this too may end up being different especially as tax rate is very heavily impacted by the mix of earnings which is impacted by currency.","With that I am going to turn this over to Larry for his comments.","Lawrence Ellison","Thank you, Safra. As Oracle Cloud business gets bigger, our growth rate is going up. As our competitors' Cloud businesses get bigger, their growth rates are going down. This has big implication I'd like to explain.","In Q2 we booked more than $170 million in new SaaS and PaaS annually recurring revenue or ARR. In other words, we sold over $170 million of new SaaS and PaaS annual subscriptions this past quarter.","In Q4 of this fiscal year, we expect to sell more than $250 million of new annual SaaS and PaaS subscriptions. That means, during our next fiscal year we will sell well over $1 billion of new SaaS and PaaS annual subscriptions.","What makes this particularly interesting is that next year Oracle will sell about the same total dollar amount of new SaaS and PaaS business as Cloud market leader salesforce.com. Stay tuned, it's going to be close. We are catching up to them and we are catching up very quickly.","Mark, over to you.","Mark Hurd","Thank you. Okay, let me just give you a couple of numbers and a few names and then we will go to your questions. SaaS and PaaS revenue as Safra mentioned grew 41% in CD. ERP EPM revenue grew more than 80%. CX revenue grew nearly 50%. I think that company Larry mentioned salesforce.com reported 28. CX marketing automation grew 200% in revenue but we are the clear number one. Bookings grew nearly 150%. I want to say one more time it was 150%. Fusion bookings, ERP, HCM and Sales Force Automation all grew triple digits.","All pillars saw booking growth in excess of 50%. We added more than 860 SaaS customers with more than 230 that subscribed to more than 1 pillar when they bought a cloud subscription from us. Nearly 650 existing customers expanded their cloud services in the quarter. In HCM we added 230 new customers, in CX more than 460 new customers, in ERP EPM 250 new customers. In one quarter we added 2.5 times Workday's entire install base. Nearly 150 of the new ERP customers did not have any Oracle ERP before they bought Cloud subscription from Oracle in the quarter.","Overall Fusion has triple-digits bookings growth, triple-digit revenue growth. We had over 125 go-lives in Q2. That's SaaS. In PaaS we had a breakout quarter. We had 150 brand new PaaS customers. As many of you know, we announced PaaS at Oracle OpenWorld, the end of September. Three quarters subscribed to multiple PaaS services, the PaaS opportunity is big given the size of our install base and you might argue is big or bigger than the SaaS opportunity.","Let me read you a few names from the quarter. In HR, Fidelity National Financial, Pella, Siemens, Barnes & Noble, Baylor Healthcare System, DIRECTV, Honeywell, Johnson & Johnson, Kaiser, Nokia, Northup Grumman, Societe Generale, Skanska. In sales service clouds, FlowServe, 3M, Adidas, Equifax, DIRECTV, Fiat, Tellus, United Parcel Service, Visa, Yahoo, Big server, Super Cypress Semiconductor. In marketing cloud, Bloomberg, Equifax, Fiat, Honeywell, Ricoh, Siemens, Telefonica, Visa, Emerson, Kroger, Lego Systems. In ERP EPM cloud, Odebrecht in Brazil, HJ Heinz, InBev, Lafarge, Michael Frager, and I don't have more time to read more. These are like huge list of logos that we gained in the quarter.","Couple other comments, premise software grew 6% in CD. I continue to expect this business to grow nicely while our cloud continues to maintain hyper growth.","Moving quickly just to mention hardware. Engineered systems bookings grew double digits. Bookings for Exalogic, SuperCluster and big data appliance, (inaudible) point all grew more than 50%. And I just want to make sure for those of you who don't listen to additional hardware companies' calls, it is clear we are taking substantive market share in hardware.","And wrapping up, our cloud revenues' already at a $2 billion rate and I said at the Financial Analyst meeting our SaaS pipeline is large. Since then it's gotten bigger. We outpaced our bookings growth planned for the first half of the year and set our sights on 100% bookings growth for Q3.","With that we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities.","Richard Sherlund","Hey, thank you for taking the question, and good quarter. On the cloud side, I am curious as far as the new versus exiting customers, I think you got some metric there. Could you give us a sense of are you seeing a conversion from existing on-prem customers or is most of this new business that you are picking up? ","Mark Hurd","Well, first let's go through it by pillar because I think that's the way you have to do it. In marketing everything is really new. We don't have a market install base. So when we give you those numbers, Rick, there really everything coming is a net new logo.","Now it may be in a company that's got Oracle product but it's all net new. Most of our sales Cloud is net new. There is some Siebel conversion but as I mentioned at the Financial Analyst meeting, our Siebel install base, when you look at the sport numbers, is fairly stable. So we have a lot of net-net new even in if you will sales Cloud. We have a mix in HR both conversion and net new. And I think the important thing you saw this quarter as we talked before Rick, I think it's not just the fact that our strategy isn't the just best of breed in each of these apps, but also to have a suite of capability, and that's why I wanted to mention the multi-pillar deals that occurred in Q2 because we have customers now that are not just buying in ERP from us but they are buying ERP and HR. They are buying sales Cloud and marketing. And we also get the opportunities to go back into that install base once we've got one app, and sell a second app, a third app, a fourth app. And so it was an exiting quarter across a number of those metrics.","Lawrence Ellison","Rick just for me to add one thing. As Mark said you have to take a pillar by pillar, you also have to take it layer by layer in the cloud. So -- where a lot of our SaaS business are brand new logos. People who've never done business with Oracle before you would expect that in PaaS it's virtually all our install base. But the reason being almost every moderate size company in the world is already an Oracle user. So the PaaS we are selling at this install base as Mark said SaaS is a bit of a mix depending on pillar.","Richard Sherlund","Yes, and Larry you are seeing customers pivoting now to PaaS and infrastructure as a service, if you could maybe spend a moment on that.","Lawrence Ellison","Again, I think, we are pushing very hard as PaaS as opposed to infrastructure as a service. I mean that's where our huge differentiation is, that's where we give you so much more automation in terms of database tuning and installation and backup and recovery and logging and security. So our big push is in the PaaS. We are in infrastructure as a service which is a low cost commodity business where we have the same pricing as Amazon and Google and the rest. We are in that because when our customers come, as Mark said earlier, they buy one pillar and go buy another. I can talk about layers in the Cloud, will they will buy a few SaaS applications, they will buy some PaaS and they will buy some infrastructure as a service as they want to have a unified security model and a vast network to interconnect all of these pieces.","Richard Sherlund","Thank you.","Lawrence Ellison","Thank you Rick.","Ken Bond","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard","Hey, good afternoon guys. I have two questions. One I want to follow-up on the Cloud piece and then I had a question on the database.","On the cloud piece Larry, you talked about a billion dollars in bookings. I just want to make sure then I am reading this correctly. That's an incremental one billion\u2026","Lawrence Ellison","Yes, Jason, on the -- that's another business that we will have sold when you annualize. This is not total contract value. This is in terms of annual subscriptions rates. We will sell next fiscal year well in excess -- we expect to sell well in excess of $1 billion of new annual subscriptions.","Jason Maynard","And that's on top\u2026","Lawrence Ellison","Which is about what Sales Force will be selling in their next fiscal year. I think they are 1.1 something like that best as we can estimate. And we think we have a good chance of passing them. I don't know, we could pass them or catch them or -- but it's going to be very close. We are in that ballpark. So we are selling new business at the same rate as the market leader next year which I think -- we are expecting this hyper growth. Sales Force is slowing down, we are speeding up. They are only twice as big as us. Their round numbers are 4 billion, we are 2 billion. But we are growing a lot faster, and we have a lot more products, and we have a large install base to see into. So we think again I said -- announced, just words. We said -- we think we can become number one in the Cloud. We think we will be number one in the Cloud, and we will be number one in the Cloud very quickly.","Mark Hurd","And Jason, just to add to your question, I mean most of -- all of our comments that Larry made, then I made in that effort, we are all talking about ARR, not TCV.","Jason Maynard","Right.","Mark Hurd","So there's not a multiplier on -- or average contract value is up longer than annual.","Jason Maynard","Right.","Mark Hurd","But we are talking in comparisons of ARR. IBM will announce a $1 billion deal over 10 years.","Jason Maynard","Right.","Mark Hurd","That $1 billion deal to us would be $100 million. If it was a 10-year deal, and it's evenly distributed, we would count that as $100 million of ARR.","Jason Maynard","Right.","Mark Hurd","100 million over one year. We annualize all of this stuff, how much of revenue once they are installed and running, and that there's a delay between when we book something and when we start collecting revenue because we don't collect revenue till the users are up and running and it's implemented. Okay, so there is that delay. But once they are up and running, it's an annualized number we are giving you, not a total contract value number we are giving you.","Jason Maynard","Right, I got that part. But I also want to make sure I am clear. This is incremental on top of your current $2 billion plus run rate?","Mark Hurd","Of course. And it should be a lot more than 2 billion by the way because that's next fiscal year. So we are not going to end this fiscal year still will 2 billion. That will grow. You have bookings that have been booked that have yet to be provisioned. Therefore you will have a bigger base on which those bookings will go. At the same time the bookings we get in the future will take time to provision as they go forward. So it's a layered model as you build up on the revenue Jason.","Jason Maynard","I want to ask one thing on the database business. Larry, lot of customers in the past, they have been conditioned to wait for R2 of the database to come up. This time around you guys made a major release this past summer with the N memory option. I would be curious to get your take on what you are seeing in terms of customer adoption, are we starting to see folks, hey we are going to move to this incremental dot release that came out, I think it was June-July time frame. Or some folks still waiting for R2 and what's the advice to the guidance from Oracle in terms of when customers should migrate to 12C? Thank you.","Lawrence Ellison","Okay, so there are two major pieces of our new database release, once as you mention is the memory option. But that's not the only driving factor where people are operating their database version.","The other is metal-Tennessee, the multi-tenant option which is appropriate for the Cloud that allows them to again convert all of your existing Oracle applications and make them multi-tenant applications while preserving security and reliability, a better way than do multi-tenancy at the application layer.","Anyway, we think those two features in concert are driving -- will drive a much more rapid adoption, the Oracle database over the next couple of years. So we think our database business is going to have a very strong 24 months coming up.","Safra Catz","And Jason the options did very-very well in the quarter. So there's no question customers are extremely interested and are buying the options.","Jason Maynard","Right, great. Thank you guys. Appreciate the answers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America.","Kash Rangan","Hi, happy holidays and good news from Oracle to hear that. Can you talk about the net new cloud bookings and what exactly is driving that? If you can give us color by product, is it HCM or serum, or to Larry's point, the layer. Is it the PaaS or the SaaS layer or geographies? And in particular, Larry, if you could drill into the PaaS layer and help us understand is it a net new market or could it come at the expense of the traditional database business, which maybe gets cannibalized or maybe not? Just wanted to get your thoughts on it. Thank you.","Lawrence Ellison","Let me -- Mark will give you a more detailed answer, but my answer is yes. It's all of the above. One other thing, we have such a broad -- if you look at our product line versus our competitors, we are Salesforce's only real competitor in sales automation. We are the leader in marketing automation. We are fighting hard to be the leader in service automation where our competitor is salesforce.com. We are Workday's only real competitor in HCM, and we think we have passed them in HCM. But you can make an argument we are both fighting our new CM. but we are killing Workday in ERP. If you conclude ERP and EPM together, it's planning, budgeting, performance management and their graphic ERP, all of that, we sold 2.5 times more customers this past quarter than they have done in the life of their company. We are the clear leader in mid-range and high end ERP with no competition from Workday. They are just not there or when they are there they are losing every time.","So we are very strong in HCM, we are very strong in ERP, we are very strong -- we are the leader in ERP, we are the leader in marketing, we are the leader in EPM, we are contending for leadership in service automation and in HCM and we they guys in second place behind Salesforce in Salesforce Automation. But every place else except for that one segment, we are the leader or fighting to be the leader.","So we have incredible breadth of SaaS products. Now our SaaS products are built on top of Java and the Oracle database, the platform, and companies want to make extensions to the applications. They want to link the applications to existing applications, and so on. Using our platform, makes a lot more sense than using a proprietary platform from salesforce.com. We don't think it's a fair fight. But wait, salesforce.com uses our platform to build their applications. They just can't sell our platform as a part of their service offering to their customers. So they have not license to do so. We can sell our platform, we do sell our platform. So we sell the same platform that we build on to our customers. So we've seen a huge amount of interest. But from our SaaS customers using our platform and also there's huge install base we have in the database business.","Interested moving test and development and certain aspects of their database work to the Cloud, not everything, but a part of it, a bit of hybrid, and we are seeing these customers now experimenting, they're at the experiment level. But the potential for this as Mark said is probably bigger than our SaaS business and I think we are going to be by far the leading SaaS company in the Cloud.","Look at our product portfolio. Kash, who wins in all of these battles? The suite vendors always beat the point solution guys. It's happened in every generation of computing where the end user, the customer, doesn't want to be the integrator of 30 separate applications from 30 separate vendors. No different now, just on the Cloud now. Same problem, they don't want to integrate a lot of different stuff. We have all the stuff pre-integrated. We think we are in a great position, we are seeing hyper growth at SaaS, we are seeing hyper growth in PaaS, we are getting bigger and our growth rates are getting higher. That's the -- unlike anyone else in the Cloud business.","Kash Rangan","Thanks, and happy holidays. ","Lawrence Ellison","Yes, listen, add to it the products are more mature. We are on release 9 of our SaaS products. We only had -- not only our products' more mature, we have more of them. Our suite is broader. We've added sales capacity before 2.5 years ago. So realigning the sales force, adding capacity, they are trained, they are getting more training and we have references. And when you add the familiarity now of the SI community to it, you just have a lot of factors. There's no one of these factors in isolation, it's the culmination of a lot of work over a lot of period done.","Ken Bond","Next question please.","Operator","And you next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Great, thank you. Mark, I was wondering if you could share with us, I mean, your performance this quarter, given what's going on with currency was definitely better than I think people were expecting on a constant currency basis, even. And I'm wondering how much of that due, do you think, maybe the US environment, a deal-closing environment getting a little bit better from a macro perspective? And how much of it is due to sales force efficiency improvement?","Mark Hurd","So you are saying macro versus us?","Heather Bellini","No, macro in the US, right, seems to be doing better. So how much of it is due to kind of -- is your sales force productivity improving, and that's what's driving kind of the confidence and the guidance for next quarter, and your results on a constant currency basis this quarter? Because I think versus what everyone was thinking, things look a little bit -- things are looking better.","Mark Hurd","Well I don't think anything changed from what we had been seeing for a while. The only difference is we saw it in pipeline, we saw it in proposal, and now it's turned into actual numbers and performance. So I don't think this is an event. I think this is a set of activities that have occurred over a long period of time, as I tried to reference in my previous question. I would not take some short-term improvement in the US macro and turn that into -- that's whey Oracle has great cloud bookings in Q2. I think our performance was driven by exactly the phenomena that I described. Better -- great products, more mature products, better references, lots of capacity in our sales force that's better trained that's out in the market winning deals. That's what I think drove it.","Lawrence Ellison","I would like to second what Mark said, is we're just further up the learning curve and everything. Our sales management team terrific. We realigned our sales force against our secular competitors. So we have an HCM sales force that goes up against Workday. We have a sales automation sales force that goes up against salesforce.com and we have a service automation sales force that goes up -- but they are different -- it goes up against salesforce.com. We have a marketing automation sales force, we have an ERP sales force, we have an EPM sales force. We have all of these specialized sales forces and we created those, actually Mark created those several years ago, and we have been hiring, staffing, and they are much more mature.","We started working on some of these products. Lot of these products are -- we built them internally. We started about 10 years ago -- after 10 years of development, the Fusion applications, again Mark said we are on release 9, and they are getting really good, the user interface is getting good, we are getting -- we have a lot of good customer feedback again over a period of years. We have improved the UIs, we have improved that multi-national capability. There -- we have improved security in the Cloud, we are the leader -- I think we are the leader in application security in the Cloud.","So it's just walking up the learning curve, and at some point it becomes visible to everybody. Now I think we've been -- a few quarters ago talked about the size of the pipeline, look pretty good, they are kind of stunning. But I know the next thing is it turns into bookings, the next thing it turns into revenue, the next thing is we have more revenue than anyone else in the Cloud, and I think that's the next shoe that's going to drop.","Heather Bellini","Great, thank you.","Lawrence Ellison","Thanks Heather.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies & Company.","John DiFucci","Thanks. I have a question for Safra. Safra, as you said CapEx has creeped up a little bit, it's up 26% on a trailing 12-month basis or about 150 million. Non-GAAP operating margins have really helped steady as has free cash flow. But as you transition to more Cloud based business, should we expect free cash flow to trail off a bit even if it's just temporarily?","Safra Catz","It's all so tiny -- these amounts are so small in the scheme of what's going on. I mean -- I think it's kind of unusual that I would even call out a $150 million increase year-over-year on capital expenditure but since you guys aren't even used to it I figure let me call it out as small as it is. Obviously in the launch for PaaS and the volumes that we are expecting, we made our investments. And as we expand, we will continue, but these are really tiny numbers and are totally dwarfed by our 14 billion plus in free cash flow. I mean it's kind of -- I am not sure other companies would've even mentioned it, and you are probably asking me because other companies make these enormous announcements of spending billions and billions and you have to remember, I mentioned it at Financial Analysts Day, we control almost our entire supply chain. You see, we literally -- I mean we are very close to starting with sand, and then we have computers. I mean we make almost everything, and as a result we get everything at the best possible prices and economies of scale. We are already a very large company, so we already had huge investments over the years, and so you have a lot of capacity and again -- so I would not fret on this really small number because I am not planning on making some announcement that we are going to spend billions because we've already spent and it's just showing up little teeny bitties at a time.","John DiFucci","Okay, thanks, that's helpful. If I could, just a quick sort of tactical follow-up and it's regards to guidance. And we can go through our own calyx of foreign exchange effects to get a reported number relative to the constant currency guidance, but generally what's the delta in growth for the top line between constant currency and reported numbers that you have?","Safra Catz","In this past quarter that we just had?","John DiFucci","No, actually I'm talking about guidance, yes.","Safra Catz","No I didn't give -- listen, the rates right now compared to last year depending on which line item because it depends for us geographic distribution and all of those things. It's over 4%, in some areas it approaches 5%. I mean it's -- the number of currencies really collapsed in comparison to the dollar. So if that's what you are asking me, I think I am answering, if things stayed as they are today, it is over 4% of the impact in many of the big numbers -- of the numbers you guys follow.","John DiFucci","Okay, great, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill","Good afternoon. Safra, just on operating margins, there's been a lot of focus, if you can continue to drive steady operating margin improvement despite this transition in the cloud. I think you were clear to John that the investments are already in. But as you look at kind of the next level of operational improvement, where do you see the biggest levers? And I guess as you transition in the Cloud, as more of the business gets there, is this inherently a more profitable business from your perspective, as you get to that side?","Safra Catz","Yes. I mean there's no question. We have done the analysis and I think I shared at least some of it with you all during Financial Analyst Day, but there is no question that at scale we continue to improve our margins dramatically taking advantage of both our economies of scale and our controls, almost our entire supply chain and really our intense automation which really ultimately results in our being very-very price competitive and allowing our customers to spend much-much less all in than they ever did and yet we get a much more significant percentage of their wallet share. So we expect as we continue to go -- I am very pleased with where margins are laid out this quarter, and as we get to volume, I actually think we are going to do better -- continue to do better.","Brent Thill","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. And I'd just like to echo the congratulations for this quarter. Most people have touched on a lot of the other lines of businesses so far, but I want to ask a question about hardware. You guys exceeded your guidance this quarter and guiding for growth year-over-year again next quarter. Just give us a sense for what you're seeing in that hardware line. And we finally hitting that point that you all have talked about that the stuff that you're not focused on is getting small enough and declining less that the growth areas are starting to show through, just how we should think about that would be great?","Mark Hurd","Well, I think you should think about it that we are just winning. I mean that would be the overriding thing I would take away. So you look at some of the markets we are in particularly in computers that are scaled computers, the $20,000, $25,000 and up category that you typically see from most of the research firms. We are gaining startling amounts of share. And you are talking about growth rate, gains of share that are 7, 8, 9, 10 points of share gain and if you are going to ask what the drivers are underneath it, they're what we've been talking about before. We had double-digit bookings growth in engineered systems as I described a few minutes earlier. Safra and I both mentioned a couple of products and we've had very good performance out of what's called the Oracle SuperCluster, The SPARC SuperCluster has had significant growth. We've had very good growth and a product we don't talk about much called the Oracle Database Appliance. It's had significant growth for us. And so that this whole strategy of lining hardware and software to gather is what customers want. I can make an argument to you; it's the same market trend you see in the cloud. We just do more work for the customer. We integrate the products for the customer, the customer doesn't have to do it. We optimize the software for the solution and it's delivered us strong growth. And so when you look across really every line for us we had very good performance, by the way, I should add, in storage.","Storage, our network attached product, again now it's a bigger base, had very strong growth in the quarter as well. So we're quite pleased with the performance we have seen in most of our product categories across most of our geographies particularly in terms of share gains.","Philip Winslow","Great. Thanks guys, and congratulations again.","Mark Hurd","Thank you.","Safra Catz","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.","Karl Keirstead","Thank you for fitting me in. I've got a question about two growth metrics that stood out to me that exceeded my expectations, and I'd love some color. The first, and maybe this is directed to Mark. Mark, it felt like North American database in the prior few quarters ran a little bit less than expectations. And yet Safra mentioned in her comments that North American database sales were back to double-digits. And I'd love to understand what drove that. It doesn't feel like there's a big broader demand improvement, so I'd love to know how you pulled that off? It's impressive. And then for Safra, you put up 9% software support revenue growth in constant currency. That's actually the best number you've put up in a little while, and I'd love a little color on that? Thank you.","Mark Hurd","Well I think on the database question North America, Larry answered that a bit earlier talking about 12c. I mean we are into a new release. We have talked about the timeframes it would come on board. You saw a good performance in North America, frankly when you looked at database overall in CD, we grew like 5, 6 points -- I will say 6 in CD. And so again my guess would be we're gaining share. Again as you look at database overall, I know you mentioned the metric you described about database, but as I tried to go through at Financial Analyst meeting, when you look at the CAGR on a three-year basis, it is a very strong upper single digit CAGR in database. So while you talk about one quarter or another. This is not new phenomena that you see this kind of performance in database and that with 12c. Our pipeline has grown in database and I think it's reflected in the numbers that you saw in the quarter.","Karl Keirstead","Thanks, and Safra, yes.","Safra Catz","Yes, sure. I am actually looking at all the numbers and the contract base and it's been going up -- I mean it jumps around, but I have other quarters where it's very close. And remember we are selling in extremely large amount, cancellation rates are very low. Attach rates are extremely high. And all of that added together just ends up with a good number.","Karl Keirstead","Right. Okay. Thanks a lot.","Mark Hurd","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bond for his closing remarks.","Ken Bond - IR","Thank you, operator. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department if any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you again. Thank you for joining us today. With that we will close the call.","Operator","Again, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"16300":["Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) Q4 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call June 19, 2018  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Ken Bond - SVP","Larry Ellison - Chairman and Chief Technology Officer","Safra Catz - CEO","Mark Hurd - CEO","Analysts","Brad Zelnick - Credit Suisse","Sarah Hindlian - Macquarie","Phil Winslow - Wells Fargo","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs and Company","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Michael Turits - Raymond James","John DiFucci - Jefferies and Company","Operator","Welcome to Oracle's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President. Sir, you may begin.","Ken Bond","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.","On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.","As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today.","As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments or a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise or revoke or publicly release any revisions of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone.","We had a terrific quarter and a tremendous number of wins in the Cloud with total revenue growth one point above the high end of my guidance and earnings per share $0.05 above the high end of my guidance.","Before further discussing our Q4 results, I'd like to comment on updates we've made to our financial reporting so as to better describe our business since we introduced the BYOL license initiatives to our customers.","BYOL, which is Bring Your Own License, allows customers to move their existing on-premise licenses to the Oracle Cloud so long as they continue to pay support for those licenses. BYOL also makes it cost effective for customers to buy new licenses, even if those licenses are only going to be used in the Cloud.","So some of our customers are buying new licenses and immediately deploying them in the Cloud. In fact, our largest license sale in the quarter was a Cloud license.","Other customers, like AT&T in their release, are moving their existing licenses, excuse me, moving the existing licenses they own to the Cloud while continuing to pay support. Support for licenses that have been moved to the Cloud is Cloud support.","As a result, our new license revenue is now a combination of new Cloud licenses and new on-premise licenses. Our support revenue is now a combination of Cloud license support revenue and on-premise license support revenue.","To reflect these changes in our business, we have now labeled new software licenses as Cloud license and on-premise license, and we\u2019ve combined Cloud SaaS plus Cloud PaaS and IaaS plus software license updates and product support into Cloud services and license support.","So to say it another way, customers are entering into large database contracts where some of those database licenses are to be deployed on-premise, while other database licenses are used in the Cloud. Previously, all of those license and its related support revenue would have been counted entirely as on-premise, which clearly it isn\u2019t.","In addition, customers that are in the process of moving their existing database licenses to the Cloud previously had all of their support revenue counted as on-premise. Again, which it isn\u2019t. We have reflected these revenue reporting updates in our expense reporting as well.","Our Cloud SaaS and PaaS and IaaS Services are all moving into our new second-generation data centers based on our bare metal infrastructure with a single unified operations team. Data center expenses there are shared across SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, giving us economies of scale and other efficiencies.","We\u2019ve also consolidated most support functions across our software technologies in the Cloud and on-premise. Sharing our teams across the different offerings allows for improved asset utilization and has a positive effect on our gross and operating margins.","Now that we\u2019ve built a rapidly-growing multibillion dollar Cloud business, our management team is focused on two principal financial measures to judge our success. First, we expect our overall revenue growth rate to accelerate because our growing Cloud revenue is becoming a larger and larger percentage of our total revenue. While any one quarter\u2019s results may vary, we expect to increase our revenue growth rate this year and beyond. Second, we expect that we will once again deliver double-digit EPS growth for the year.","Okay. Turning back to our results, first, I\u2019ll go over Q4 and recap fiscal year 2018 before moving on to my guidance. I\u2019ll then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.","As in prior quarters, I\u2019ll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rate, unless I say otherwise. This quarter, currency movements resulted in a 2% tailwind on revenue, which was approximately $140 million less than when guidance was given, and currency movements had a $0.02 positive impact to non-GAAP EPS, which was $0.01 less than the $0.03 which I guided to. Regardless, we exceeded the high-end of both ranges.","Total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 5% in constant currency, 7% in U.S. dollars. Under our prior reporting structure, in Q4, what we previously called total Cloud revenues were $1.7 billion.","I cannot stress enough the stability and growth of our installed base of customers quarter-after-quarter. Our customers are maintaining and expanding their Oracle environments because they have portability to use our licensed software on-premise, in the Cloud or via hybrid environments.","This is largely because our products are capable of doing things others just can\u2019t do, whether that\u2019s security, performance, scalability or the autonomous features that only our database has.","As our customers adopt our technologies, whether via licenses or Cloud services, our overall customer base is growing, and that growth is starting to accelerate. The gross margin for Cloud services and license support was 86% and as we continue to scale and grow, I expect this will go even higher.","Total revenues for the quarter were $11.3 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.3 billion, up 4% from last year and the operating margin was 47% which was up from 46% last year.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 19.2%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% and EPS was $0.99 in USD, up 11% and up 9% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 17.7% and GAAP EPS was $0.82 in USD, up 8% and up 5% in constant currency.","Now moving on to the full fiscal year. Total Cloud services and license support revenue was $26.3 billion, growing 7%. Total company revenues for the year grew 3% to $39.9 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.12 in USD, up 11% in constant currency and up 14% in USD. This was largely driven by the acceleration in operating income growth which was up 9% in USD, 6% in constant currency. This is mirrored in our operating margin for the full year which was up from 43% last year to 44% this year.","As a reminder, our best-ever full year operating margin was 47% and I expect we will surpass that in the coming years as our total revenue growth accelerates and we benefit from greater scale in our business.","Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was a record $15.4 billion, up 9% in USD. Capital expenditures for the year were $1.7 billion and free cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.7 billion, up 13% in USD. We now have approximately $67.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $6.6 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.4 billion, up 2% in constant currency.","As we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter we repurchased 106 million shares for a total of 5 billion.","Over the last 12-months, we have repurchased 238 million shares for a total of 11.5 billion. Since FY 2011, when we ramped up the share purchase program, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 20%.","In addition, we have paid out dividends of $3.1 billion over the last 12-months and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.","Now to the guidance. First of all, we will be adopting the new accounting standard ASC 606 with a full retrospective view starting in Q1. We will also provide you with the prior-year results reflecting ASC 606 so that you can compare it.","Secondly, my EPS guidance for both Q1 and FY 2019 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base rate, but I expect that in normalizing for these onetime events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2019.","Importantly, in regard to Q1 guidance, exchange rates have moved from a 3% revenue tailwind to now being a 1% headwind from the last time I gave guidance. That is a 4% negative move, which impacts revenue in Q1 by about $300 million. It also impacts EPS negatively by $0.03.","So, for my guidance, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 9% and 13%. I\u2019ll do the math for you, that\u2019s between $0.67 and $0.69. And non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 11% and 15%, and, again, doing the math, that\u2019s $0.68 to $0.70.","For the full year, we expect to have a higher revenue growth rate than FY 2018 and once again deliver double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. Total CapEx for FY 2019 is expected to be similar to FY 2018\u2019s CapEx of $1.7 billion, but it could be a little higher depending on bookings.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark for his comments.","Mark Hurd","Thanks, Safra.","I thought for a change I\u2019d just start by listing off Cloud wins in Q4. Let\u2019s start with ERP. Let me just run through some of these brands. BEA, Baylor University, Cerberus Capital Management, ConEd, Cox Communication, Danaher, Facebook, General Dynamics, Genuine Auto Parts, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Kohl\u2019s Department Stores, Land O\u2019Lakes, Marsh & McLennan, Mount Sinai Health System, Pernod Ricard, Scholastic Corporation, Siemens, Cleveland Clinic, Time Inc., United Parcel.","These can be modules. In many cases, we\u2019re replacing in for SAP. Some cases upgrading our user base. This was a fantastic ERP quarter. And not just in volume, but the quality of the brands. Let me turn to HCM.","Before I go into details, let me just say every win is versus Workday, full stop. Akamai, AT&T, Baylor University. As you can tell, that was a dual ERP HCM win. You\u2019ll hear a few of those. City of Jacksonville, ConEd, Delta Dental, First Data, Grupo Televisa, Ingersoll Rand, Juniper, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Manpower Group, Mount Sinai Health System. Again, a multi-dual win, if you will. Noble Energy, Providence St. Joseph Health, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Sherwin-Williams, Time Inc., Toyota Motor, University of Wisconsin, Zebra Technologies. A lot of wins. And I have more, I just don\u2019t have time. It was that sort of quarter for us.","As it relates to platform, two very significant ISVs have gone live in production with us. One, Manhattan Industries. And one of the largest networking ISVs in the world have made significant commitments to production and nonproduction workloads that are now live on our Cloud. We beat AWS head-to-head on price, performance and breadth of services for these wins.","There\u2019s a little bit of mention of AT&T. I thought I\u2019d give you an update on AT&T. AT&T, of course, is moving thousands of terabytes of data to the Cloud. We have begun to migrate thousands of these databases as we speak. We expect within the fiscal year to have the AT&T data centers all connected to the Oracle Cloud, migrating this massive dataset.","We expect this, of course, to be the first of many that we\u2019ve started to sign in Q4. I mentioned a couple of the ISVs, but the importance of the progress is to be noted.","Just a few numbers to close up. In the apps ecosystem, 91% now of our trailing 12-month revenue is recurring. The apps ecosystem is now bigger than $11 billion. It\u2019s up 11% year-over-year, and as I think a year ago, I mentioned that I expected our apps ecosystem to grow roughly double-digits. It did. It did a little better than that.","We\u2019re growing faster than the market, and while I list all of these wins, most of these wins that I list are not coming from our user base. Our user base, while heavily now represented in our pipeline - Larry had a very important announcement last week - but it is still not the bulk of what is in our Cloud and that opportunity is yet ahead of us.","Some numbers on SaaS. Overall ERP and HCM revenue was $2.2 billion for the year. Fusion Apps, up 62% for the year. Fusion ERP was up 60% organically, 68% for the year. Fusion HCM was up 72% for the year.","I want to make sure I say this number carefully. NetSuite bookings in the quarter were up 62% in constant-currency. This reflects the investment we\u2019ve made in go-to-market that we started a year ago that began to reflect itself in performance in the back half of the year. This will lead to accelerated NetSuite revenue in 2019.","Our tech ecosystem is now greater than $21 billion and up 5% for the year, with the database ecosystem up 6% and accelerating in Q4 with an exit growth rate of 7%. BYOL is clearly resonating with customers. Q4 database new license revenue was up 9%, and autonomous database is now beginning to show up in our pipeline.","And we\u2019re pleased to do license revenue for our key database options which are necessary to run the autonomous database. We\u2019re up mid-teens in the quarter. Our next-generation PaaS grew 45% for the year, with now total revenue of $1.1 billion.","I\u2019ll close by just saying I think we\u2019re executing well on now what is a growing pipeline in both apps and autonomous database with 5% top line growth and 14% EPS growth in FY 2018. To Safra\u2019s point, looking forward into FY 2019, revenue growth is expected to be higher than FY 2018 and EPS will grow double-digits for the year again.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry.","Larry Ellison","Thank you, Mark.","We\u2019ve just about finished enabling all of our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Cloud Services to run alongside each other in our new second-generation bare metal data centers. This consolidation of all three categories of Cloud Services, SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, into a single standard data center allows us to share access while giving us significant economies of scale. As a result, we expect continued expansion of our Cloud margin.","But just as important, to have SaaS, PaaS and IaaS in the same data center makes it easier for our Fusion customers to extend those SaaS applications using our latest PaaS and IaaS technologies and capabilities.","As an example, we recently demonstrated how one of our customers used our mobile service, our Cloud mobile service, our Cloud voice service and our Cloud machine learning service to extend our Fusion HCM system with an Amazon Alexa voice interface for vacation requests and vacation approvals.","We\u2019ve developed these new technologies, machine learning, voice and mobile, so we could voice-enable all of our applications, and we\u2019re putting those voice systems, a combination of chat box, voice, all machine learning driven, we\u2019re putting those voice interfaces as the next generation of our UI for Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM.","The technologies that we use to add the voice interfaces to Fusion HCM and Fusion ERP are available as PaaS services in our Cloud to our customers. So if there\u2019s something they want to add to Fusion ERP or HCM they could do it using the same tools we use to build the applications in the first place.","We think that\u2019s a big deal. We think having SaaS, PaaS and IaaS all integrated together in the same data center is the key differentiator between Oracle and our Cloud competitors, most of whom are focused primarily on SaaS only or primarily on IaaS only.","With that, I guess we open it up for questions.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Larry. Operator, if you\u2019ll please start preparing the audience for Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.","Brad Zelnick","Thank you very much, and congrats on a nice Q4. Mark, I think it\u2019s fair to say everyone\u2019s very surprised by 9% database license growth in the quarter. I want to make sure I heard that right and that overall database ecosystem growth accelerated in Q4, and this is even without autonomous database fully available just yet.","So my question, how much of this is just customers purchasing ahead and buying into the strategic roadmap or are there other factors we should consider?","Mark Hurd","First of all, you\u2019ve got those numbers right so I\u2019m glad because that means I said them right. And we did see acceleration in the quarter and I think it\u2019s all of the above. And again, it\u2019s back to the point of we\u2019ve had good demand sort of across-the-board.","And the other point I tried to make, and I went through the numbers relatively quickly, was the option number. The option number in the quarter was mid-double digits. The necessary options to enable autonomous database and I think, Brad, that\u2019s, again, a key number. And back to the fact that this represents to us whether that shows up in Cloud revenue or license revenue. You see it start to show up in both numbers.","For example, we had a really cool win in the quarter that I just ran out of time to mention at Ford. Ford was literally a BYOL customer or a BYOL transaction in the context of it was a combination license deal and Cloud deal in the sense of Cloud the way we would have historically reported Cloud revenue at the same time.","And again, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, you\u2019re just, Brad, beginning to see the beginning of autonomous database. While we\u2019ve been talking about it, we went really GA with autonomous database, data warehouse in the beginning of Q4. So it\u2019s just beginning to show up in our pipeline.","So to all of your points, the numbers in Q4 show numerically the progress and certainly what we begin to see now in our pipelines now that the technology is literally rolling out. We\u2019re in hundreds and hundreds of trials and proof-of-concepts and those are, of course, the beginning stage of all of this.","So yes, we\u2019re pretty encouraged and certainly the fact it showed up in Q4 numbers is encouraging as well.","Brad Zelnick","And just a quick follow up for Safra. Safra, it\u2019s great to see double-digit EPS growth back on the table for fiscal 2019. Can you just remind us what your assumptions are that get you there, particularly on the buyback? Thank you.","Safra Catz","I don\u2019t usually give guidance on the buyback, but we view our stock as very inexpensive and we view it as something in the range of where we\u2019ve been lately.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie.","Sarah Hindlian","My question is for Larry. Larry, we\u2019re just talking about it and 2018 is clearly rolling out. But the one thing I want to understand better - I\u2019d like to understand a little bit better customer demand and adoption trends too, but I\u2019d also like to hear a little bit about how more regular annual database updates versus what I would consider, historically to be more large and monolithic upgrades. If that can actually change any software-buying patterns of the customer and if that\u2019s something you\u2019re starting to see or thinking about.","Larry Ellison","Well, let\u2019s see. I think we used to have - let\u2019s say a few years ago you could expect a major database release every 2.5 years, something like that was the cycle. Clearly, where - and when a new database release came out, that often spurred a certain degree of buying.","Now, keep in mind, we still have a major database release coming out periodically, but it\u2019s going to come out - because of the Cloud now, it comes out a bit more frequently, and a lot of the autonomous features are being added very rapidly. For example, we came out with - I guess, we went GA - as Mark pointed out, GA and autonomous database at the beginning of Q4.","We will have our simple trends autonomous transactional OLTP system, we will call \u2013 or a combination of OLTP and data warehouse integrated coming out in the next month, or so. And then, a couple months after that, we\u2019re going to have the high-performance, high-reliability OLTP system coming out. So some of the autonomous features are coming out at a more rapid rate than some of the more mature features in the database.","Those features that are aimed primarily at the Cloud are going to be delivered at a higher rate. I hope that answers your question, than we have historically.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.","Phil Winslow","Just a question to the team here. On the Q1 call, you talked about the legacy IaaS business versus the new IaaS business. And then, on the Q3 call, you talked about legacy SaaS versus the newer SaaS products. And, Mark, obviously, you gave some color on the newer ones in your prepared remarks. But hoping you\u2019d just give us a little more detail, sort of just the trends that you\u2019re seeing there called new versus legacy IaaS and SaaS, and how you\u2019re thinking about sort of the crisscross points there with the newer businesses that are growing quickly sort of get big enough and keep growing fast enough to sort of offset whatever you\u2019re seeing on the legacy front.","Safra Catz","Is that for me or for Mark?","Phil Winslow","Jump ball.","Mark Hurd","Well, I\u2019m taller, so I\u2019ll start. But I think you hit it right, Phil. I mean, listen. Just to give you an example, I gave you two wins I named Manhattan and a new ISV that\u2019s I think I used the term big networking company. That\u2019s a brand new app to the Oracle Cloud. Brand new. Remember brand new app to Oracle, let me start with that.","App wasn\u2019t running on Oracle. We moved it to Oracle, as well to the Oracle Cloud. So you have a couple of different dynamics here. Yeah. There\u2019s some legacy stuff and what you would have think of as the traditional reporting that we use, but we\u2019re in the top of the first inning of all this.","To Larry\u2019s point, we released Autonomous database in April. It\u2019s showing up in trials and POCs, not in the numbers even that you\u2019re seeing here. We\u2019re getting new ISV wins that are just net-new to Oracle in addition to bringing our existing customers to Oracle.","So, again, we\u2019re in the law of small numbers here, relative to the entire company that have tremendous upside here, but the key thing for us has been getting our products in the market. The next generation I mentioned, I gave you a statistic on the 45% growth rate in our next-gen PaaS Infrastructure business for the year, and that\u2019s obviously the next-gen of it, and that\u2019s at the very embryonic stage, Phil, of the beginning of this.","And these wins are now just these trials and POCs. The example of the ISVs, they\u2019ve yet to really just to start to produce revenue, because you got to start with the work and then you start moving production. And, in fact, Manhattan has already moved \u2013 just begun to move a couple of their customers to the Oracle Cloud as part of this. So we\u2019re at the very early phase of this, and the lines will cross, obviously, relatively soon here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs and Company.","Heather Bellini","I wanted to ask a little bit about BYOL and Oracle Cloud infrastructure. And Mark and Larry, I know you guys touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks, but can you give us a sense of where we are in the migration to BYOL? And I guess in particular, can you give us a sense of the momentum within your enterprise accounts using these technology rights in the Cloud, and how do you see the slope of this adoption curve as you look ahead?","Larry Ellison","Well, I think, again, maybe the most interesting fact in the quarter was our very largest deal in terms of a new license purchase was we know the intent of this particular customer, and the intent was to deploy 100% of it in the Cloud immediately.","So we\u2019re seeing, you know, I guess we\u2019ve mentioned AT&T 35 times now on the call as an example. But they\u2019re an example of one of our largest customers that really has an intent to move the majority of their Oracle data into the Cloud.","So that\u2019s just a gigantic one, but AT&T is unusual because they\u2019re such a \u2013 that\u2019s such a large \u2013 it has so many large Oracle databases. But many of our other customers, now that we have BYOL, can move their Oracle database license from on-premise into our Cloud and they just pay basically for the incremental infrastructure cost and they continue paying support on what becomes a Cloud License. That\u2019s a very attractive value proposition for our customers, and we see large numbers of our largest customers very interested in beginning that migration process.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow","Can I double-click on licenses again? You had tough comps because Q4 last year was strong on licenses, so \u2013 and I know last quarter, you kind of talked about some delays on the apps on the vertical apps side. So can you talk a little bit about like how we got to the number that we have there now between Bring Your Own Licenses but also how it played out on the apps side? Thank you.","Mark Hurd","Well, without sounding trite, we just sold more. And I think at the end, it\u2019s a combination of what we said. I mean, you\u2019re exactly right. Q4 last year was a very good strong quarter for us, so it was, if you will, a tough comp. But to Safra\u2019s opening comments, the quarter was strong for us really across every line. I mean, the only thing that really hurt us in the quarter to be honest with you if you looked at the income statement was currency.","We went in expecting to get 3 points. We got 2 points. We wound up beating on top of that, and so it was just a solid quarter. And I don\u2019t really have any, Raimo, discrete stories to tell you to give you more flavor.","Obviously, the database ecosystem was strong, and clearly, the options within \u2013 we accelerated database growth in the quarter. Database options within the context of a \u2013 particularly those that enable autonomous data warehouse were strong in the quarter.","Our apps license did decline in the quarter. We expected that, but frankly, it was actually relatively stable, so \u2013 if you will, because the user base is still the scale that it is, our apps license was a decline but better than I expected within the context of that decline, if that makes sense.","And so it just \u2013 obviously the quality of the brands on the bookings side, which don\u2019t show up in actually the income statement, was just \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say it was unexpected, it was just pleasant to see it all come through.","And I just want to double-click on the NetSuite booking. The NetSuite booking, while it is what we hoped, it\u2019s so great to see because it\u2019s been such a fabulous acquisition for us. The team has done a great job. We\u2019ve invested, and it showed up numerically in the bookings and that\u2019ll show up in the revenue as we go forward in 2019.","So as I go through the quarter \u2013 and we haven\u2019t mentioned our expense structure. We\u2019ve got a lot of leverage there as well, and so just as I look through the lines just from an operating perspective, it was a very solid quarter. Maybe more than you wanted in your question, Raimo.","Raimo Lenschow","Thank you.","Safra Catz","Well, also, we - Raimo, let me just add, we launched BYOL at the very end of Q2, and this really opened up a lot of ULAs and PULAs for our customers who are very interested in being able to deploy in the Cloud and on-premise. It\u2019s particularly of value to them.","And so there are literally billions of dollars involved in these agreements and it\u2019s many, many customers, it is very widespread and it really shows up in Q4. And shows up in all the quarters, but of course after BYOL, it really showed up in Q4.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Safra Catz","Kirk?","Mark Hurd ","Kirk, we can\u2019t hear you.","Ken Bond","Kirk, going once. Twice. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.","Michael Turits","I think this is probably a question for either Mark or for Larry. Can you talk a little bit about how customer demand for database in the Cloud is evolving both for new workloads and for existing workloads and how the balance is working out by whether or not they\u2019re choosing BYOL or database as a service?","Larry Ellison","Well, they\u2019re overwhelmingly - at least - again, it\u2019s early days because BYOL has only been around a couple of quarters. It\u2019s overwhelmingly BYOL because - for new workloads and for shifting existing workloads.","I mean, Oracle has - a majority of the world\u2019s databases are Oracle databases. We\u2019re larger than IBM and Microsoft combined who are second and third and we have a lot more to - and we have much bigger databases than they have and all of that.","So there\u2019s just a huge inventory of information inside of these databases and these - and we have huge customers with - that own licenses for all of this stuff and they want to move - not move all of it at once.","I mean, AT&T has actually made a commitment to move all of it in a relatively short-term. Other customers are moving, but not as rapidly. And they are buying additional options for their existing licenses so they can move into the Cloud and take advantage of autonomous services.","So let me \u2013 let me explain the situation. So you want \u2013 you want to move 10% of your databases from on-premise into the Cloud and you want to use the autonomous database. Well the autonomous database requires that you have the multi-tenant option and the real application cluster option. So you might have database - you might have some database licenses, but you might not have licensed those options.","So you go ahead and enter into a ULA or PULA, one of these large license agreements. You add these additional options and maybe additional database licenses. And then when you have those additional options, you then - that makes it possible for you to take advantage of the autonomous database services. But if you don\u2019t want to use the autonomous services, you can still move your database into our Cloud. You just don\u2019t get the autonomous features.","But most people are very excited about the autonomous features because it at once lowers labor costs and secondly, dramatically improves security and reliability because there\u2019s no pilot error, there\u2019s no opportunity for mischief by taking out the labor. So not only do you save a lot of money by eliminating the labor. Again, you have a much more secure and much more reliable system. No pilot error, no mischief.","So they\u2019re entering into these ULAs, they\u2019re buying additional options and then they\u2019re moving their licenses over. We\u2019ve been at this for a very, very long time. New workloads. All of the new workloads of that \u2013 for any given year is small compared to the 25, 30 years of inventory of data that we\u2019ve accumulated since we\u2019ve been in this business.","So again, overwhelmingly existing databases, not new workloads. Overwhelmingly, BYOL as opposed to-database services. Now, we\u2019re getting some very exciting new workloads. Don\u2019t get me wrong. The new workloads are very important to us. There are lots of cool start-ups and we\u2019re going after those aggressively and we\u2019re getting a lot of those.","I know Mark mentioned earlier that a lot of our customers - a lot of our new customers in the Cloud are not existing Oracle customers. So, obviously, those are new workloads, and we\u2019re getting a lot of those.","But you said where is the majority of it? The majority of it is inside of our install base. They\u2019re reusing their existing licenses. They\u2019re buying additional options. They\u2019re moving it to the Autonomous database in the Oracle Cloud.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies and Company.","John DiFucci","And my question, I think, is probably best fit for Safra. So, Safra, we understand how the separation of Cloud and on-premise sales sort of gets blurred with the flexibility you allow your customers with BYOL. So I think from a high level, we all understand why you changed the way you report. But how do you get investors comfortable that this also is not obfuscating any Cloud weakness?","Especially, when I look - and I know we don\u2019t have a long-term deferred revenue, but the deferred revenue looks a little bit - it was below what we were looking for. I\u2019m just trying to anticipate questions I\u2019m going to be hit with tomorrow. And, frankly, looking at your stock, I mean, when you put the headline numbers, the stock popped, and I know you may not be looking at it minute-by-minute. But then, when the details came out, it actually dropped. So I think that might be one of the reasons anyway.","Safra Catz","Right. So let\u2019s cover everything. So first of all, there is no hiding. I told you the Cloud number, 1.7 billion. You can do the math. You see we are right where we said we\u2019d be. No surprises. Margins up sequentially shows business is doing well. Cloud billings strong. Nice and strong. You can hear that. You can hear it from what we\u2019re talking about.","As far as net deferrals, gross deferrals are actually up 5%. So this is just a collections thing with timing, and you\u2019ll see that quarter-to-quarter, especially Q1 from Q4. So this is nothing surprise here. We don\u2019t have any bad news.","In fact, what we\u2019re telling you is in fact that the way to understand our business better, especially with so many customers taking licenses and support that licenses that are supported that we were counting and calling on-premise when in fact they are not deploying them on-premise. It would be - it\u2019s simply not so.","And so, we want to explain to you and make sure you understand and have enough understanding of the business to see that our customers are both buying licenses and using licenses they have, which are currently being recorded as on-premise support. They\u2019re using those, in fact, in the Cloud, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s, of course, what they were designed for, frankly, and what we\u2019re very excited about.","So, I think, between all of the information I\u2019ve given you, it\u2019s quite clear that we had a superb quarter and we\u2019re expecting the same next quarter.","John DiFucci","But if you could, just remind us when you refer to gross deferrals versus net deferrals. And I know that you, Oracle, is probably more conservative than I think any company we cover in your reporting of deferred revenue. But if you could hit that quickly, that\u2019d be great.","Safra Catz","Yes, I mean, from the gross deferrals, what we do is we subtract the uncollected, which is, obviously, a very big number at the end of Q4. Think about it. So that\u2019s all that\u2019s going on there.","Mark Hurd","John, just Mark. To add, there is just no story in the gross short-term deferral. I mean, this is a nothing burger, and I\u2019m telling you that the gross deferrals were right on where we thought. There\u2019s just nothing here.","Ken Bond","Thank you, John. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the Press Release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking with you.","Thank you for joining us today.

Now, I\u2019d like to turn today\u2019s call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, I hand the floor to you.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.","On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.","As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. ","As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendment for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.","And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had a terrific quarter with total revenue growth one point above the high end of my guidance and earnings per share $0.07 above the high end of my US dollar guidance. I\u2019ll first go over Q4 and recap fiscal year 2019 before moving on to my guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.","As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rate unless I say otherwise. Now the effects of currency movements in Q4 were largely as expected, maybe a smidge more incremental headwind than expected, but that was not a full percentage more. Anyway, total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were 6.8 billion, up 3%, while cloud license and on-premise license revenues were 2.5 billion, up 15%.","In particular, technology license growth was up 19%, making it abundantly clear that customers are investing in the Oracle platform. The key database options necessary to run the Oracle autonomous database service grew 21%. I cannot stress enough the stability and growth of our base of customers, quarter after quarter. Our customers are maintaining and expanding this Oracle environment. And in our BYOL, bring your own license model, they have the portability to use their licenses on premise, in the cloud, or via hybrid environments. ","This popularity is largely because our products are capable of doing things others just can't do, whether it's security, performance, or scalability and in our cloud autonomous capabilities. As our customers adopt our technologies, whether via licenses or cloud services, our overall customer base is growing and that growth is starting to accelerate. In addition, the recent interconnect agreement with Microsoft will only help accelerate the transition from on premise database to the autonomous database service.","Now, to the numbers, the gross margin for cloud services and license support was 86% and as we continue to scale and grow, I expect this will go even higher. Total revenues for the quarter were 11.1 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was 5.3 billion, up 7% from last year, and the operating margin was 47%, which was up from 46% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 16.4%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items and EPS was $1.16 in US dollars, and up 27% in constant currency, and 23% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 3.3%, also a result of some discrete items and GAAP EPS was $1.07 in US dollars and up 41% in constant currency, 36% in US dollars.","Now, moving on to recap the full fiscal year, total cloud services and license support revenue was 26.7 billion, growing 4%. Total company revenues for the year were 39.5 billion, growing 3% as compared to 2% total revenue growth in FY18. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.52 in US dollars, up 19% in constant currency, up 16% in US dollars, driven by operating income growth, share repurchases and lower tax rate. ","This is mirrored in our operating margin percentage for the full year, which was up slightly to 44% this year. As a reminder, our best ever full year operating margin was 47%. And I expect we will surpass that in the coming years as our total revenue growth accelerates, and we benefit from greater scale in our business. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was 14.6 billion, lower than last year, only because, as you will see at the bottom of our cash flow statement in the 10-K, FY19 cash tax payments were $1.3 billion higher this year, including the 610 million installment towards the transition tax in Q2, and nearly 540 million in higher tax payments in Q4. ","Capital expenditures for the year were 1.7 billion and free cash flow over the last four quarters was 12.9 billion. We now have approximately 38 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short term deferred revenue balance is 8.4 billion, up 3% in constant currency. As we said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. ","This quarter, we repurchased 112 million shares for a total of $6 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 734 million shares for a total of 36 billion. Over the last five years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by almost 25% with nearly 60% of the total reduction this past year in FY19. In addition, we've paid out dividends of 2.9 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. ","Now to the guidance, my guidance today is a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming the current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have about 1% negative effect on total revenues, and about $0.01 negative effects on EPS. So, for Q1, total revenues are expected to grow between 1% to 3% in constant currency and assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow between 0 and 2% in USD. ","Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 14% to 16% and be between $0.81 and $0.83 in constant currency and assuming the $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 12% and 14% and be between $0.80 and $0.82 in USD. Now, this past year, we grew 3%. And for fiscal year 2020, I expect total revenue will grow faster than last year, constant currency of course, and that we will once again report double digit EPS growth. ","Total CapEx for fiscal year \u201920 is expected to be about 2.2 billion, but it could move a little depending on our bookings. My EPS guidance for Q1 and fiscal year \u201820 assumes a base rate of 20%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base, both higher or lower. But I expect that in normalizing for these one-time tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.","Mark Hurd","Thanks, Safra. Really, we just had a solid quarter from top to bottom. Total revenue was up 4% in constant currency with cloud license and support up 3% and EPS up 27% in constant currency. In apps, we had great momentum, we grew 6% for the year. We're now at $11.5 billion in trailing 12 months revenue. 92% of that recurred. We continue to grow revenue faster than market. And we have just an enormous opportunity in front of us in ERP and HCM and I'll talk to that in a second.","In SaaS revenue and bookings, let me just give you a few stats to give you some context of what happened. Overall, ERP and HCM annualized SaaS revenue is now at 2.9, or call it 3 billion, and it was up in the high-20s. Fusion apps revenue was plus 36% in Q4, and up 32% for the full year. Fusion HCM was up 25% in Q4, solid growth, with nice wins that I'll discuss again in a second. Fusion ERP revenue was up 44% and also up 44% for the full year. NetSuite ERP was up 28% in Q4, as the strong momentum continues. ","They had strong bookings in the quarter. And I remind you that last Q4, they had 72% growth in bookings, in addition to what was a plus 30% growth in bookings this Q4, and that's what drove this revenue growth. And when we acquired NetSuite, we had roughly 15% growth rates, and those have doubled now since the acquisition.","In our verticals, the revenue was up 19% and 32% for the year. In our data as a service, just to give you some further context within our SaaS business, our challenges related to the broader privacy issues continued and revenue was down 15%.","Now, I'm going to give you an IDC quote that I have to read as is, so I can't improvise, but let me give you the quotes, the words, and then the closed quotes. \u201cPer IDC's latest annual market share results, Oracle gained the most market share globally out of all enterprise applications, SaaS vendors, three years running, in calendar years \u201916, \u201817 and \u201818.\u201d And I can\u2019t improvise on that quote, although I'd like to. So anyway, we assess strong momentum in the app space. I'll talk to you about some of the wins in a second. ","In our infrastructure ecosystem, the [indiscernible] ecosystem was 21.1 billion on a trailing 12 months basis and Q4 was up 7% with database up mid single digits, driven by mid-teens database license growth and we repeat that mid-teens database license growth. Autonomous database, and I'm telling it, while the numbers helped us in Q4, they were still small. But -- if you extrapolate them, they are relatively -- not relatively, they're very significant. More than 5000 new trials were added in Q4 alone.","We got a great pull-through business with 40% of our Q4 wins. So 40% of the time, we won our autonomous database, we pulled through analytics. We're adding many new customers, so of all the customers we\u2019re adding with autonomous database and you might think we're replacing just our base which by the way, we\u2019d be required to do, about 20% of our customers are just brand new to Oracle. They were not an Oracle Database customer, when they bought the autonomous database. And new workloads are 40%, meaning that I am an Oracle Database customer, but I'm putting a different workload on the autonomous database than I had on the Oracle database, but we have both new and existing customers doing both.","Now, to Safra\u2019s point and she hit it briefly, I want to hit it just a little harder. In the key database options that you need to run autonomous, so these being wrapped and multi tenant and active Data Guard if you want the SLA, our license growth was up 21%. So why do you think the market is growing 2, 3, 3 points up whatever number you think from your favorite analyst. This was a huge share gain customer for us or share gain quarter for us in database. ","It was a solid quarter, we exceeded our revenue target and saw 27% EPS growth. Our bookings growth climbed with our renewal rates, meaning our continuing renewal rates of existing customers gives us confidence that our cloud apps business will also just continue to strengthen from here. I thought I\u2019d give you just a couple of key wins we had during the quarter and I'm going to try and give you a little more color of the typical size of the companies we're selling to.","I'm going to try and give you a little bit about who we replaced in the deal and give you some rhythms, so you get a feel for all this. Some of our key wins and I'll focus on some back office wins. Argo Insurance, about $2 billion company; [indiscernible], a mining company in Australia, $2.3 billion company, Diebold Nixdorf, that's an interesting one because I used to compete with them when I was in MCR, Diebold bought Nixdorf and Diebold was an EBS customer, Nixdorf was an SAP customer. They combined the two and they will be going to Oracle Cloud ERP. So whole Diebold Nixdorf will run on our Oracle Cloud ERP. [indiscernible] out of Brazil, about $31.3 billion, they bought ERP supply chain and procurement, fantastic win for us and they were running on TOTVS, Brazilian ERP company and so they\u2019re net new to Oracle.","Experian, which is a $1 billion company bought our whole -- really our whole ERP suite, ERP planning, supply chain, procurement, they did it against a background of basically having a little bit of everything, they had a little bit of EBS, a little bit of SAP and a little bit of Microsoft and replaced it all with the Oracle Cloud. Now, this company you may never heard of, Helmerich & Payne, the reason I've heard them is their stock symbol on the New York Stock Exchange was HP. ","And for years, I wanted their stock symbol and they're about a $1.6 billion company. And while I never got the stock symbol from them, we have replaced Epicor with Oracle cloud ERP at Helmerich & Payne. So anyway, that would just give you some idea on that. Ferguson, which is one of the largest plumbing wholesale and distribution companies, they are a $21 billion company. They bought ERP, EPM supply chain procurement. Just a tremendous, tremendous win for us and we\u2019re looking to partner with them. Santander in the US, another tremendous win for us. ","Wright Medical, which was very competitive, Emerson Electric, [indiscernible] University, which is deployed, not only all of our financials and ERP, but are deploying our new student scheduling system which deals with all of commissions and commissions for grants and discounting, very difficult stuff to deal with in higher ed. So very key win for us in the quarter, a great HCM win at waste management. Waste Management is a $13 billion company in Houston. This is HCM, payroll, talent, some amount of ERP. Tiffany, I'm sure all of you have bought something from Tiffany for some important occasion. Tiffany will be running on our HCM location. ","Okay, I'm getting a sign to stop here, but it was a very good quarter in terms of just quality logos and I think what I was, let me just try to do one, maybe a couple of other things for you, just to give you some flavor. We get asked this in Q&A a lot. I'm just reading down the list and -- of what I'm looking at as about 150 on my page, I\u2019d say 120 bought more than one module from us. And as I read the competitors, the competitor or the incumbent that got replaced, they start SAP, EBS, EBS, Totus, Microsoft, Epicor, Infor, Lawson, Infineon, Microsoft, EBS. I mean, I could go on and on, but that would give you a flavor that we're getting as many and I didn't do this accounting exactly, but as many of our logos from outside of the traditional Oracle user base, as we are from the Oracle user base. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Larry Ellison","Thank you, Mark. As Mark said, in Q4, we saw a surge in database license sales. We also saw very rapid growth in sales of those database options required to run our autonomous database. We continue to gain overall database market share as we migrate our database users to the cloud. In the quarter, we added over 5000 new autonomous database trials in our Gen2 public cloud. Our new Gen2 cloud infrastructure offers customers a compelling array of advanced technology features, including our self driving database that automatically encrypts all your data, backs itself up, tunes itself, upgrades itself and automatically patches itself when a security threat is detected. It says all of this autonomously, well running without the need for any human intervention and without the need for any downtime. No other cloud infrastructure provides anything close to these autonomous features. ","Ken Bond","Thank you, Larry. Holly, if we can start the Q&A portion of the call please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Michael Turits, Raymond James.","Michael Turits","Good evening, strong quarter in a lot of ways and database obviously stood up, but I'd like to ask about the recent Azure partnership. In general, your strategy has been to make sure that on premise Oracle workloads move to Oracle Cloud. Does this Azure partnership represent an opening to Oracle workloads running on other clouds? Or is it more directed at just getting Azure services integrated with Oracle Cloud workloads?","Mark Hurd","It really is most customers have Microsoft technology and Oracle Technology. So, they might have a Microsoft analytics suite and their data in an oracle database and we want to make it as easy as possible for you to run those Microsoft analytics in Azure, accessing the Oracle database and the Oracle public cloud. And we built these high speed interfaces and made -- as we made, we glued the technologies together. But we also have unified the customer experience. So the customers, it feels to the customer like they're working in one cloud, but they have two suites of products and technologies they have access to, and they can interconnect those things. But now, the Oracle database is still running in the Oracle Cloud and the Microsoft analytic technology is running in the Microsoft Cloud. They're just talking to each other at high speed and highly reliable.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler, Bernstein Research.","Mark Moerdler","Congrats on a strong quarter. I'd like to focus my question on the database business and especially autonomous database. Mark, Safra, thanks for the data you gave on autonomous, on the call. But can you give us some more color on how we should think about the database revenue going forward? Is autonomous adoption hitting the stride where we're going to visibly see the license revenue on a quarter by quarter basis and what's this impact going forward on cloud revenue?","Mark Hurd","Let me give you what I think is maybe the most interesting thing we can say about this. We have two ways of forecasting our autonomous database business. One is the traditional way where the field comes out with quarterly forecasts. We put together annual plans. And that's, in fact, what we relied upon for years in terms of giving you guidance. But now that we're in the cloud business, we have some interesting additional data, not around field sales, if you will, bookings, for selling our cloud services and our technology, but rather, we have real data about consumption inside of our cloud, and we started collecting the consumption data, because to add capacity to the cloud, Safra said, depending on bookings, we might have to spend more money. ","Let me be a little bit more precise. It's not even bookings that drive it. Bookings that lead to increased consumption triggers our just-in time provisioning of hardware into our public clouds. And right now, we're getting signals from our usage in our Gen2 cloud that is signaling much faster autonomous database growth than we're seeing from our sales forecasts. It's just kind of interesting, but encouraging.","Operator","And our next question is going to come from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse.","Brad Zelnick","It's great seeing the business accelerating like this. My question is for Larry. Larry, it's so nice to see the early success in autonomous database and demand for database options. But as we think about the long term prospects of the database business, in years past, a lot of your success was tied to the ISV ecosystem. And it would seem the future is increasingly about embracing software developers. First, would you agree with that statement? And how do you see Oracle attracting developers to your database and OCI more broadly?","Larry Ellison","I think you\u2019re saying the same thing, why is it attractive to -- why is it good to attract developers, because developers write applications, and most important applications are ISV applications, which are used across the board. So I don't think anything's changed at all. Developers were always, if you will, the foundation of our business. We have over 1 million developers in our ecosystem already. And most ISVs, most of the current ISVs in the cloud use the Oracle database. I mean, everything that Salesforce.com runs pretty much is running on the Oracle database. ","Everything that SAP acquired to run in the cloud runs on the Oracle Database. Now, I know SAP says they are going to move [indiscernible] but that said that 6 years ago, haven't quite gotten there yet. Anyway, we go after developers. In fact, yesterday, we were putting the finishing touches of a program we're going to be announcing to developers at Oracle OpenWorld, which is basically free services to developers, [indiscernible] if you will. ","So developers and college entrepreneurs can get this free service, will be able to provide this free service that will let developers to start on the Oracle cloud, build their applications, and graduate from being a maybe a sole entrepreneur, someplace in the dorm in MIT to eventually being an entrepreneur starting a company and then becoming an ISV. That's the cycle. We want to sign up people early. And we have all sorts of cloud programs we're putting in place to be able to do that.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of John DiFucci, Jefferies.","John DiFucci","You know what, I'm going to follow up with another database. I know the apps was good too, but I can't help myself, been waiting for this. ","Larry Ellison","[Technical Difficulty] We\u2019ve been working on this for a long time and it's great to see it just begin to show up in the numbers. ","John DiFucci","It is and the timing is kind of odd, Larry because many infrastructure companies this quarter have struggled lately and as you probably know, the logical conclusion from the investment community was that we\u2019d see some relative weakness out of Oracle, but your constant currency infrastructure growth was better than it\u2019s been in, I mean, since you've been doing this. So like over the last since I went back looking back to 2006 -- fiscal \u201816 and in this quarter, the constant currency growth was better than it\u2019s been since -- over that time period. I guess, Larry, you mentioned the options and that's something we\u2019ve been sort of waiting for and looking for. I guess, can you give a little more detail on that? And then, maybe even more generally, maybe, Mark, if you can give us some detailed comments or comments on the general broad base infrastructure IT demand out there. We're not just covering Oracle, right. We're just trying to figure out what's going on out there.","Larry Ellison","Okay, so let me -- there are two options that I think Mark mentioned them that are absolutely required to use autonomous database. One is the multi-tenancy option. This is the one where you can take an existing application, it could be an ISV, take an existing application that was never built to be multi-tenant, you move it to the Oracle database, you don't change a thing, and you suddenly have a multi-tenant database. So that's one thing that's required for autonomous database.","The other thing is this real application clustering. Real application clustering refers to the fact that we use multiple computers to run every database instances. So in case one of those computers should fall off, there's, our systems are [fall tolerant] [ph], they keep running. So the autonomous database never breaks, never breaks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, stand by. And our next question is going to come from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.","Larry Ellison","Heather, can you hold on for a moment. Heather, can you hear me okay?","Heather Bellini","Yeah. Can you hear me? We went silent for a minute before.","Mark Hurd","Okay, I apologize, everybody. Why don\u2019t \u2013 Larry, would you like us to continue on or\u2026","Larry Ellison","I\u2019d like to answer the questions.","Safra Catz","Yeah. John, did you get any of Larry's answer?","Operator","Standby, let me open up John\u2019s line.","Mark Hurd","Thank you, Heather. John, we\u2019ll get you back on the line and we'll kind of figure out, apologies for this logistics.","Larry Ellison","Let me, I\u2019m going to cycle back and repeat my answer. So the answer, there are two options required for autonomous database. One is the multi-tenancy option. And that allows, let's say, an existing ISV to take an application that was never meant for the cloud, move it to our autonomous database with the multi-tenancy option, and suddenly, they're not changing their application, their application becomes a multi tenant cloud application. That's one key feature and we've seen sales of that skyrocket.","The other key feature of autonomous database that's required to use autonomous database is this feature called RAC. RAC is the ability to use multiple computers to run a single application or a single database instance. So in case one of those computers should fail, we tolerate that failure and the application keeps running, because we have multiple computers, you might have 1, you might have 2, 3, 4, but you lose 1 or 2, you still have 2, 3, 4 left, whatever \u2013 however you configure the system, we will only configure autonomous database with multiple computers. ","Autonomous database never fails, you must have the RAC option to ensure that. RAC options are growing more rapidly than you would expect being driven again by consumption of the autonomous database. So we're seeing very, very rapid adoption. In fact, another thing to add a little color to this, initial transaction, a lot of our existing customers might come in with a very small project, let's say, a $30,000 ARR project, and within 60, 90 and 120 days, that becomes $120,000 project. ","And after another few months, it becomes $0.5 million project. So, we're really optimistic about this business. And the optimism and I'm just back to what I said earlier, the optimism was not in Safra\u2019s guidance, which is based on sales forecasts. The thing that I find fascinating are the consumption data curves, which shows our consumption rate growing much faster than the fields currently anticipating. To me, that\u2019s just wonderfully encouraging. And hopefully this is the beginning of the trend. We'll find out soon.","Ken Bond","Okay, Holly, if we could now\u2026","Larry Ellison","I think Mark had a follow-on. Do you have closing remarks as well?","John DiFucci","It was just, we're seeing a lot of funky stuff out there for infrastructure software. And I\u2019m just wondering, I mean, you guys have a broad customer base, just like wondering what you're seeing in general. Are you seeing any, I mean, your business is strong, but there's a lot of companies that have struggled recently. Are you seeing anything -- any changes out there for infrastructure demand in general, beyond Oracle, even?","Mark Hurd","Yeah. We have new hot products. I mean, that's the difference. I think that, again, I won't speak to everybody, but when you go out with the autonomous database, Larry talked about a lot of different factors. But from a business perspective, we very rarely had a product that we can go talk to somebody at a senior level and say, how would you like to get more secure, save money and get better performance all at the same time. ","Larry Ellison","How would you like to outsource the security detection and patching responsibilities to somebody who does this for a living? So you never have to read the name of your company above the fold on the front page, talking about how much data you just lost. So, I\u2019ll let Mark talk.","Mark Hurd","Well, this is a really simple message. This is different from saying, we've got a new, we've got a new partitioning. Yeah. Anyway, it's just a very different approach for us and so we've got new products, you know about the strength John, you mentioned in cloud apps, and, we benefit from a set of competitors that are in different stages of maturation, most of which are weak. And we've got great products, and what we're just now bringing out in autonomous database. And so, I think that's a bit different just in terms of the various product cycles that we're in, versus what other people might be in. ","Larry Ellison","Yeah, let me maybe then close with -- I couldn't agree more with Mark on really great, hot new products, like autonomous database, Fusion cloud application suite, NetSuite are selling really well and that\u2019s very accelerating. They're doing extremely well. Quite frankly, we have some other product lines that we\u2019re quite naturally downsizing, like some of the acquired kind of hardware. There are some oldest on-premise, software products that aren't really doing well. Mark mentioned data cloud, because of all the privacy issues. So yeah, there are some of our businesses that are not, if you will, hot. But the good news is, the hot businesses are now bigger than the not so hot businesses, and that's determining our future.","Mark Hurd","What Larry said is right. I think it's worth noting, our SPARC business declined 24%, 25% this quarter. Our NetSuite business grew, as we described, in the high-20s. And they don't cancel out and that's what's now bigger, but when we look at the aggregate growth rate of the company, it's made up of negative 25s and plus 27s, like what I just described. And so, it does create the phenomena that Larry described.","Larry Ellison","Yeah. Again, it looked like and I swear this will be the last part of the answer to your question. It does look like, the top line is moving up modestly. But underneath that, there's really a lot of activity, you have these very, these modern businesses like the autonomous database, Fusion, NetSuite growing very rapidly, taking share. Clear number ones in the overall marketplace. [indiscernible], this is dominant and number one and provide ERP. And, you have these other businesses that are melting away and we just don't care. We are focused on our SPARC products and our SPARC products are now driving our top line higher.","Operator","And our next question will come from Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Okay, so I guess I should spend a little bit of time on the app segment, given everyone's been focusing on the infrastructure segments so far. It obviously looks like that was another strong quarter there. I was wondering Mark, if you could share with us in terms of how the SaaS business is performing, if you could look out next year. I mean, you had tougher comps in the fiscal year that just ended, right, as the anniversary of NetSuite went on. When you think about the types of acceleration we could see, can you walk us through kind of the puts and takes in terms of the types of acceleration we might be able to see in that business? And also, I wanted to ask you, I mean, SAP is going through where they're trying to get customers to re-platform, how much of an opportunity is that for you to go and potentially, win back some of those customers or to win some of those customers for the first time, so wondering kind of the competitive environment I guess that\u2019s in Workday and SAP and how you're seeing that play out within some of the announcements [indiscernible]?","Mark Hurd","Okay, well that question would take me like an hour to get [Technical Difficulty] The abridged version, I think to your point, SAP is forcing older customers to a new platform by the beginning of 2025 that forces all their customers to move and all the changes, not just the changes they've just made, but all the changes they made to the code has to be remade to the code. And what that means is, they have to roll up a big new bill to move to this thing Larry called earlier HANA. And it's a big damn bill and so the poor CIO or CFO, wherever this guy is, has to show up to the board and say to the board of directors, we've got a $500 million bill to move to HANA and you all on the phone are smart. My guess is the board member says something clever, like, what's HANA? ","And the guy goes, well, it's a platform and the guy goes, well, what's the platform? He goes, well, it's a new thing we run our ERP on. The guy goes, okay, and it costs $500 million. The guy goes, oh yeah, and he goes, what do we get for. The guy goes, well, we get some new plumbing and we get some new this and I just think that meeting goes very badly. And somewhere in the mean, the customer goes, who else have you talked to? Do we have an alternative? Could we not do it? Could we go with somebody else? ","So yeah, I mean, I think it's an incredibly interesting strategy on their part, to put all their customers at play. Do we get calls from customers that we haven't been called or talked to in 20 years? The answer is yes. And is it because and remember, Heather, you know, this that when we sold to customers 15 years ago, they never really talked to us after that and vice versa because you're expected to stay with these ERP systems forever. So yeah, some percent of their base will move as a result of just this, because it's a lot of money for not getting much, real simple.","Heather Bellini","Anything on Workday?","Mark Hurd","Again, I think Workday does, again, my sense of Workday is they do a decent job, an upmarket HCM where they can divorce the HCM buyer from the ERP buyer. When the ERP buyer and the HCM buyer are aligned and combined, they are really in a position with no chance because they don\u2019t have much real financials product. And I know they hype it and they talk about it and all that, but at the end of the day, they're just not competitive. So for us, the market really is for us to keep moving ahead. Our market share must be in cloud financials now, but it must be plus 90%, 92%, 93% and 94%. ","So, yeah, do I think we can accelerate? I think the greatest story you can see here is the NetSuite story that we doubled the rate. And if I didn't say enough things about NetSuite, because I'm sure the NetSuite team is listening. Let me say NetSuite, NetSuite, NetSuite. They have just done a fabulous job. And they're doing a fabulous job, not just growing internationally, but growing domestically. A lot of this performance in NetSuite is just pure US domestic performance, more salespeople, more industries, micro industries that we build for, better execution. And so between NetSuite and Fusion, we've just had a really good run. I won't tell you everything's perfect, which is really good news. With these numbers, we can do better. We can do better. And I think we're just getting our stride. So, I feel very good about another.","Safra Catz","Yeah. And as Fusion becomes a higher percentage, Fusion ERP is growing so quickly and it becomes a bigger percentage, it just kind of overwhelms everything else.","Mark Hurd","Yeah. That's the mix change. I mean, that's what you're seeing really in this quarter, is the beginning of the fact that our hot, rapidly growing products are now bigger than some of those products again, like SUN, SPARC that are in decline. And, we kind of cross -- those two curves have crossed one another. Yeah. Fusion is an international product in a lot of countries and now we\u2019ve moved NetSuite to a lot of countries. And quite frankly, we haven't really started to get the benefit of that just yet. So that's going to kick in this fiscal year and that will have a big impact.","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Phil Winslow, Wells Fargo.","Phil Winslow","Yeah. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great finish to the year. A lot of time has been spent on platform and applications, wanted to focus on infrastructure and hope you can give us an update on just what you're seeing on the Oracle Cloud infrastructure, to, what's the feedback from customers? How do we think about sort of where we are on the adoption lifecycle? ","And then one question I get from investors is, how should we think about OCI2 relative to the announcement with Microsoft, if there's any sort of impact there?","Mark Hurd","Well, OCI2, we had two infrastructure products. We had, what we now call OCI classic, which really is frozen, and we moved -- moving all of our customers, almost moved all of our customers, to our Gen2 cloud. Our Gen2 cloud is dramatically better I think not only than our Gen1 cloud, but other people, existing clouds. We have, without going into a lot on this, we have an architecture, where we have two separate computers and each computer that you went, if you will. And we have, the Intel computer that you read, and then we have another processor with separate memory that has all of our powered control code. ","So that's very different than Amazon or Google or Azure as an architect, should every single computer in our Gen2 cloud is really two computers, the one that the customer uses, and the one -- and another one that we use to manage the cloud and encrypt the data and encapsulate the messaging and virtualize the messaging and do all of that. It's impossible for a cloud customer to get at our code and hack it. And it's also impossible for our programmers to look at our customers\u2019 data. So we did this, we redid our architecture, because we decided that existing architectures, infrastructure architectures had just too many vulnerabilities. ","And so we bit the bullet, said, okay, we're going to freeze. OCI classic, we're going to invest in Gen2 that gives us a much more secure, much more reliable platform, and quite frankly a much faster, it's also much faster, much faster networking, and I'm not going to go into all of that, but this is a huge differentiate between us and everybody else. And customers are beginning to see that, they're beginning to understand the architectural differences, a lot of the world\u2019s security agencies are now coming to us and saying, hey, this looks really good. We're going to go with this, not Amazon or somebody else because of these architectural distinctions. ","Also, a bunch of people are running high performance workloads on our cloud, we have a much fancier network, we have RDMA capability built into our network that the other guys don't have, that's because we redid that -- we didn't have in Gen1, we have in Gen2, allows us to run large machine learning workloads, rendering simulations, all sorts of -- high performance computing way better than our competitors. So, there are a bunch of applications we just do better and people are beginning to notice and they're beginning to move and buy.","Operator","And our final question for today comes from Raimo Lenschow, Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow","I wanted to go back to the NetSuite strength, Mark and you talked already a lot about it in terms of geographic and going deep into the industry. But I just wanted to see, like how sustainable is that? Where are we in that innings in terms of going against certain countries or going against certain industries like, is that kind of the initial investment that is coming through now and then we're done or are we on the beginning of a journey here. Thank you.","Mark Hurd","First, Raimo, I think one thing that I would add to Larry\u2019s Gen2 point is customers love Gen2 and it's got a great thing. It works really well. It's reliable. It scales. We're hiring people in our engineering group, continuing to expand. And so just to add to Phil's point, I mean, it is very well received by our Salesforce, our field and it's been fantastic. ","On NetSuite, yeah, we're just at the beginning, to Larry's point, we really haven't seen the acceleration internationally that we've seen domestically. So we're adding salespeople internationally. We've done that, we've got some more to do. So, there is growth there. We are adding more countries, there is more to do there and we are adding what we call Suite success, which is where we take an industry, not even an industry, a micro industry. So instead of taking retail, we would take retail bookstores, and campus bookstores, and in universities and we would refine the solution for campus bookstores and then put a consulting offer around it that we would deliver so as a complete one stop shop for the customer. And we're continuing to build those out. So we've increased R&D yet again to do more of those, increased our sales force yet again to get after more customers. And our expectation is that we continue to drive significant growth in NetSuite.","Ken Bond","Okay. Thank you, Mark. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours.

As reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to Oracle's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.","On the call today are Executive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. As reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements we make today.","As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Before taking questions, we'll begin with some prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. I am going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal 2015. I will then review guidance for Q1 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. ","As you probably remember, I didn\u2019t provide US dollar guidance for Q4 given the unusually high volatility in exchange rate. The currency headwinds ended up being higher than consensus estimates would reflect, with 8% to software and cloud revenue as well as the total company revenue, 9% for hardware revenue and $0.09 for earnings per share. Currencies continue to move significantly and remain unpredictable. So my comments today generally reflect constant dollar growth rate which is how we look at the business. ","We are delighted with our results, with the most important thing being that we dramatically over-achieved in the cloud. This is the first Q4 where we had everything together for the cloud. We had the products that we\u2019ve been working on for a decade, the operations, the sales force and the references with many, many happy customers. Having all that in place caused SaaS and PaaS bookings to grow more than 200%, our best ever growth rate for cloud bookings and more than $125 million higher than our own $300 million goal. For most companies, as their business grows, the growth rates go down. In our case, as the business grows, our growth rates are increasing. ","So to the numbers, cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues were \u2013 I am doing only non-GAAP \u2013 were $419 million, up 34% from last year and well above the high end of my guidance. As our cloud bookings growth continues to accelerate so too will our cloud revenue growth. As I just said, bookings grew more than 200% further adding to the momentum which is helping drive SaaS and PaaS growth. ","Now when you translate the $125 million higher from SaaS and PaaS to had it been historically our license business, it probably would have been about $375 million more in license and it would all have been booked immediately, not ratably over time. So for us this was actually fantastic news. When bookings ultimately turn into revenue depends of course on many factors but one thing is clear our momentum in the cloud bodes very well for the future. ","Combined with infrastructure as a service revenue of $160 million, which was up 31%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was $579 million. ","To help you further understand just how well we are doing in the cloud, I thought it would be helpful to compare our cloud billings growth rate to that of our principal cloud competitors. Billings is generally defined as total revenue in the period plus the sequential change in gross deferred revenue. Our practice at Oracle regarding deferred revenue has always been to net out the billed unpaid invoices from our deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet. I believe that our cloud competitors follow a practice where they disclose only a gross deferred revenue book balance, not net for uncollected invoices. So we put up a spread sheet on our website to show you the same thing for comparability. ","We\u2019ve calculated Oracle\u2019s cloud billings using our competitors\u2019 methodology or the sum of total cloud revenue plus the sequential change in gross deferred revenue. What it shows is that billings grew from $468 million in fiscal 2014 fourth quarter to $834 million in this just finished quarter. That\u2019s a growth rate of more than 70% in US dollar and though there may be seasonality to billings number, this is dramatically faster than Salesforce\u2019s 21% billings growth and Workday\u2019s 31% billings growth in their most recently reported quarter. ","In summary, our cloud business is significantly outpacing the competition. Now total software revenues were $8.4 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.7 billion, up 8% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenue was $3.1 billion reflecting the accelerated migration to cloud. The shift to cloud was very pronounced in Europe where new software license sales were most impacted. But Europe was also our fastest growing region for both cloud revenue and bookings as you would expect from the substitution. ","Total hardware, including hardware support, grew 5% with hardware system product revenue of $818 million and hardware support revenue of $590 million. Engineered systems continued to be strong with double digit bookings growth and we continue to take share from IBM and HP. ","For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $10.7 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5 billion and the operating margin was 46% with currency and MICROS lowering operating margins by 2%, that [ph] we were able to maintain our industry leading operating margins with MICROS and while growing our cloud business dramatically is a testimony to the strength of our business model. While we believe our over-achievement in cloud bookings will be much more valuable in both revenue and earnings over time, cloud revenue is recognized ratably unlike new license which is recognized upfront. This shift has the effect of lowering near term earnings per share but over time will increase it significantly. So for example, a $1 million license deal which would be recognized upfront dropped right to the bottom line would ultimately result in about $3 million in revenue over 10 years. A $1 million SaaS, PaaS bookings \u2013 SaaS booking results in $10 million over that same time period. I would not trade the cloud revenue for the license revenue as cloud revenues -- and cloud bookings mean significantly more in revenues and earnings over time. ","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 25.5% and EPS was $0.78 in US dollars, $0.09 lower due to currency. The GAAP tax rate was 25.4% and the GAAP EPS was $0.62 in US dollars, $0.08 lower due to currency. Both tax rates were significantly higher than my guidance and were the result of multiple factors but generally relate to the mix of earnings between the US and other jurisdictions with the US being a larger percentage of our quarter in recognized revenue than we forecast. ","For the fiscal 2015, total software and cloud revenues totaled $29.5 billion, growing 5% in constant currency. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were $1.5 billion, growing 34%. Cloud infrastructure as a service was $608 million, growing 36%. New software license was $8.5 billion and software support was $18.9 billion, growing 8%. ","Hardware systems revenue was $5.2 billion, growing 1% and services revenue was $3.5 billion, essentially unchanged from last year. Total revenue grew 4% to $38.3 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 45% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.77. ","Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.9 billion. Capital expenditures continued to be higher as we provisioned existing orders and built out for SaaS and PaaS growth. As a reminder, our cloud data centers are built using our own engineered systems. So while CapEx is a cost to other cloud providers, a good portion of our CapEx is essentially a hardware sale which we sell as a cloud subscription. ","We now have $54 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $12.4 billion. The short term deferred revenue balance is $7.2 billion, up 9% in constant currency. As we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation, as both are critically important.","This quarter, we again repurchased 4.6 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased more than 193 million shares for a total of $8.1 billion. We paid out dividends of $2.3 billion for a total that is 80% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.","Now to the guidance. We feel very good about our own performance but of course we are keeping an eye on the macro environment especially abroad. Additionally, given the continued high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect results but as of now we just don\u2019t know how much. So I am going to again provide constant currency guidance, though I would take our results as some idea of what we think [indiscernible]. ","Clearly customers are migrating to Oracle cloud at even faster rate and my guidance reflects this accelerating mix shift. Since we are starting the new year, I am going to make some changes in my guidance. I am dropping some things, including smaller components of cloud and I am dropping GAAP guidance which both best match how we look at the business. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. So here it goes.","SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 39% and 43%. Software and cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, new software license and software support is expected to grow between 6% and 8%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 5% to 8%. ","Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.59. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being very different. ","With that, I will turn it over to Mark. ","Mark Hurd","Just a couple of quick comments, Safra, to add, I think when Safra told you about the 34% year-on-year SaaS, PaaS revenue growth, that was 12% sequential growth and almost entirely organic. We talked about billings growth of 70% now faster than Saleforce or Workday. Bookings at 426 million was 200% plus growth for Q4. ","Let me give you some customer numbers. We added 1217 SaaS customers in the quarter, new. 760 customers expanded. By pillar, HCM added 312 new customers in the quarter, 933 for the year, 3 times Workday\u2019s total customer growth over the last four quarters. ","In customer experience, we added 657 customers in Q4, almost 1900 for the year. In ERP, we added 380 customers in Q4 and 888 for the year. Our installed base is now almost 1100 ERP customers in the cloud, nearly 10X the size of Workday. And let me add, we really never see SAP. ","In PaaS, we added 1419 customers in Q4. Let me just repeat. That was 1419 customers in one quarter. We booked over 100 million and grew 100% sequentially. We are now at scale. Our cloud revenue is already above a $2.3 billion run rate. We added 858 million in ARR this year \u2013 858 million. Using the conversion that Safra used a little while ago, that would be almost 2.5 billion in license and we expect to sell between 1.5 billion and 2 billion in ARR next year. We are now growing faster than both Salesforce and Workday. And we expect revenue growth next year could be as high in SaaS, PaaS as 60%. ","Now I have given you a lot of numbers to reflect on but when you look at customer counts, booking, revenue, the result is the same. We are doing what you very rarely ever see happen in our industry. We are getting bigger and our growth rate is expanding. We will be the world\u2019s largest enterprise cloud company. ","With that, let me turn it over to Larry.","Larry Ellison","Thank you, Mark. Well, Mark gave you a lot of interesting numbers and I\u2019d like to drill into a couple of them. ","First, I\u2019d like to look at our sales growth rate of cloud applications, SaaS and platform services, PaaS. I am intentionally leaving out our cloud infrastructure business, so I can do an apples to apples comparison with Saleforce.com which does not sell infrastructure as a service. ","Okay. Last year, in FY\u201915 as Mark just said, we sold $858 million of new SaaS and PaaS business. About half of that, $426 million was sold in Q4. That\u2019s a year-over-year Q4 sales growth rate of over 200%. More importantly, the $426 million is more SaaS and PaaS new business that has ever been sold by any cloud services company in a single quarter, it\u2019s a record. Clearly our cloud business has entered a hyper growth phase. ","This year, in FY\u201916, we plan on selling between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of new SaaS and PaaS business. In other words, we plan to sell at least twice as much as we sold last year. And that\u2019s at least 50% more new business than Salesforce.com will sell in their current fiscal year. And if we exceed our plan like we did this Q4, we could book twice as much new business as Saleforce.com. Now I don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely that we will sell double what Saleforce.com sells. But it\u2019s definitely possible. ","Second, let\u2019s look at the impact these record sales rates have on SaaS and PaaS revenue. In Q4 of FY\u201915, our SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 35% in constant currency. Because our cloud sales has dramatically accelerated our SaaS and PaaS revenues are planned to grow at 60% in FY\u201916 unaided by any new acquisition. So our cloud service \u2013 our cloud business, is much bigger than Workday and we will grow faster than Workday will this year. ","Our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue is still second to Salesforce.com but we are growing much much faster than they are. So it won\u2019t be long before we pass them. ","How and why is this happening? Our SaaS growth is due to the rapid acceptance of our new generation of Fusion application. We now have over 1000 Fusion ERP customers, around 10 times more than Workday. Mark said that once, I am going to say it twice. Around 10 times more than Workday. ","Workday says they never see SAP in the cloud ERP market. That\u2019s the one thing Oracle and Workday agree on. It\u2019s between us, Oracle and Workday in the mid market and high end, the cloud ERP market and we are winning big time. We are the clear number one in cloud ERP and we are number one or number two in most other SaaS categories, including HCM, sales, service, marketing, EPM, supply chain and so on. We have a lot more SaaS application than any other enterprise SaaS company. ","Our PaaS growth is due to the huge pent-up demand for the Oracle database and Java middleware as a service. Our customers can now move their Oracle databases and Java applications to the cloud with the push of a button. That\u2019s why our PaaS business is growing even faster than our SaaS business. Things are good for Oracle in the cloud.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Larry. Before we go to the Q&A, Holly, we have just one quick clarification. Share repurchases in Q4 were 46 million shares. With that I will turn it over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. ","Jason Maynard ","Hey, good afternoon guys. Look, Oracle wasn\u2019t the first and won\u2019t be the last software company to go through this shift from selling upfront perpetual to ratable subscription licensing. And so the metrics that we are used to are obviously changing and you guys gave a lot of color around the current quarter. And what I hope \u2013 maybe we could do is drill down a little bit more on the longer term impact of the model and customer lifetime value. And I know your 10-year example, you generate more revenue with subscription. Can you guys talk a little bit about what you think the ballpark breakeven point is on a hypothetical deal, what happens to margins over this time and ultimately how this is going to impact cash flow?","Larry Ellison","I will repeat what Safra said. Okay, let\u2019s take a $1 million deal. If it\u2019s licensed over a 10-year period, you have a $1 million upfront of a license and you get 20% a year for 10 years, and that is up another $2 million for over 10 year period, you get a total of $3 million, and that\u2019s after the cost of sales, it\u2019s very profitable business. Most of that 3 million you get after the cost of sales is profit. And a $1 million SaaS or PaaS deal, you don\u2019t get anything upfront. But you have to pay the commissions. And then you only get \u2013 and that $1 million deal is worth $10 million or more than 3 times as much as the license deal over a 10-year period, over triple the value. But the accounting is entirely different. The accounting you take it ratably over that 10-year period. You have to pay the commissions upfront and recognize expenses as upfront and you get 10 years, okay. ","So now what\u2019s the profitability on SaaS and PaaS? It\u2019s \u2013 this is going to shock you. It\u2019s about the same as license and support. It\u2019s stunningly profitable. Infrastructure as a service is very different. Again I am talking about SaaS and PaaS. Infrastructure as a service, the margins aren\u2019t nearly so high. So we make money in infrastructure as a service. You can see what Amazon\u2019s profit margins are on infrastructure as a service. We think it can be a profitable business when you get scale. But SaaS and PaaS is very similar to license. So that $1 million which turned into something less than 3 million in profit after you get the scale in license, turns into something less than $10 million in profit, say 9 million in profit over the 10-year period that you are providing the service. So it\u2019s a much better business for us in terms of revenue \u2013 the revenue goes way up, the profits go way up, and the margins are approximately the same. ","Safra Catz","I think we have a huge advantage, Jason, that some of our competitors don\u2019t have. We make most of the components for the cloud service ourselves. ","Larry Ellison","Yes. Again, Salesforce paid us a lot of money for their platform. They buy Exadata from us to run their data center. They buy the Oracle database. They paid a lot of money for the Oracle database. So yes, by the way, we just signed an Oracle database deal, so SAP could run concurrent. We signed an Oracle database deal \u2013 this is all in the last 12 months, so SAP can run Ariba. We signed an Oracle database deal, so SAP could run SuccessFactors. We get a really good deal on the Oracle database, on Java middleware, on Exadata, and all of those things. So our expense profile is very, very different. By the way, it\u2019s interesting, SAP does not use HANA in the cloud very much. I know that because they keep paying us, again this quarter they paid us for Oracle [Perfect and Concur] [ph] and Oracle for Ariba and Oracle for SuccessFactors. They are using HANA for anything, I don\u2019t know about it. ","Mark Hurd","Jason, just to add \u2013 think that as you talked about the conversion from license to ratable I gave this out last quarter but I will give it again for this quarter. Last quarter I think I said that 82% of our cloud SaaS deals were actually not Oracle customers of an application when they acquired or contracted for a SaaS application. This quarter it was over 60. So these are \u2013 this is not just the conversion of Oracle customers, Oracle application customers to SaaS, this is a lot of greenfield new market share for Oracle as well. ","Jason Maynard ","Great. No I appreciate the commentary. Thanks guys.","Larry Ellison","Again to follow up to what Mark just said, so the SaaS market is much bigger than the license market. I think as Mark is saying, we know much further down the market, get the customers we could never get to before, because the SaaS service is much easier to consume for a mid-sized company than buying a computer, or opening a data center, hiring a bunch of people and running licensed software. So we think the available market is dramatically large. ","Mark Hurd","Yes, the global mid market is now available to us unlike it would have been in the traditional license model and it\u2019s very exciting. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.","Michael Turits ","Hi guys, good afternoon. Wanted to drill down on the cloud numbers and especially how they stood up probably to license. [The license] [ph] miss in the quarter as consensus by about 273, obviously that\u2019s very much due to that shift over to cloud in terms of accounting structure, terms structure. Is that all due to that or is there some impact anything negative that we should read fundamentally into the license miss and either database apps or middleware?","Safra Catz","So first of all, I didn\u2019t give guidance regarding license. So whatever number you put in your spread sheet, we didn\u2019t make that number, okay. ","Michael Turits ","No, I just meant relative to consensus. That\u2019s all.","Safra Catz","Okay. Relative to all of you who have a lot of spreadsheets, so however, the reality is I think that you can see the most instruction from what happened in Europe. Our Europe new license was down a lot. Our Europe cloud was huge. So it was -- for them they focused all-in, they went all in on pushing cloud and that\u2019s where the focus went. Other than that, I think if we are going to talk about spreadsheets that I did not actually guide you to, in currency I think you all missed the boat there too a bit. But that\u2019s okay. We got another quarter now and \u2013 but the truth is that yes, our customers are focusing on cloud as are our sales force. We have a lot of references and when a customer comes to us to the extent that they are a good candidate for cloud, which they are, we are going to be talking about cloud, we are going to be selling cloud and we would much rather have a cloud booking for, as I said, for $1 million than we would for a license deal which I book all the way right upfront to the bottom line, we would much rather have a cloud booking for $1 million than a new license dollar and we are pushing that conversion quickly.","Mark Hurd","Just to add little bit more. No region missed its CD forecast with the exception of Europe. So just to be clear, CD forecast that you are \u2013 when you are talking about dollars from a CD perspective, every region executed as we expected in license with the exception of Europe. Europe had a phenomenal cloud quarter inclusive of probably one of the most exciting financials in the cloud deal we have seen at HSBC. So some very exciting transactions in Europe and they definitely made the shift but to whatever you have in your numbers, on a local basis, no region missed its CD forecast in license with the exception of Europe that had a material shift to the cloud in the quarter, including some pretty exciting deals like what I just described. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini ","Great, thank you. And Safra, I know our spreadsheets are nowhere near as good as yours are. But just to follow up a little bit. Q4 used to be \u2013 you\u2019d always characterize as Mardi Gras for Oracle from a license revenue perspective, and now that this transition seems to be happening so swiftly, and Q1 you would always have this big sequential drop-off. I know you don\u2019t specifically talk about license revenue but given we are all trying to get a hang of how to think about the company\u2019s seasonality going forward, should we think about Q4 \u2013 the dynamic for Q4 seasonality is going to become a little bit more muted, continue to become more muted as you have this success transitioning but then again Q1 which used to be a quarter where license revenue used to have such a big sequential decline, maybe Q1 gets a little bit easier. Is there any way you can help us think about the seasonal changes? ","Safra Catz","Yes. You are on it. Yes, Heather, you have got it actually exactly nailed correctly. The reality is that cloud is growing sequentially generally regardless. So Q1 in revenues, Q1 cloud is not going to be a giant drop-off from Q4, I know. My team here is telling me it\u2019s going up. I just gave the guidance. So yes, so Heather, you have that right. So the seasonality for the whole company is muted. It is still true that from a bookings point of view and things like that, Q4 is Mardi Gras and it\u2019s still Mardi Gras. But revenue smoothes out. New license which was always just so enormous in Q4 takes a dry and drop-off, it becomes less and less important. So in total revenue the seasonality smoothes out a bit, and \u2013 but of course, our new license numbers are still very big numbers but in Q1 they are a much smaller percentage of the total than they are in Q4.","Mark Hurd","I do think it\u2019s worth nothing, Heather, that in Q4 for us on a cloud bookings basis, we came in with a forecast that we had which was what we talked about at the end of Q3 with the conference call and every week this forecast got better. Every week. There was not a single \u2013 I gave an example of one deal but there is no gargantuan transaction in there. There is no dominant region, there is no dominant pillar, it is consistent by pillar, by geography, and it was a very consistent steady move every week as we advanced through Q4.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan ","Hey guys, I am not going to ask you a spreadsheet question but I want to ask about databases. Any commentary on the new license sales of database, directionally how it\u2019s trending and also an update on 12c adoption, what percentage of the base is on 12c and any quantification you can provide on the options, that will be good. Thank you.","Mark Hurd","12c was good in the quarter. I think we gave you a comparison last quarter but if we compare it to 11, we\u2019ve been about 50% faster in feature adoptions of 12c than we were at 11, so it was very strong. And if you went by region, you saw a tremendous performance in database in North America, even in license. And you saw that really consistently across the regions except for the shift that we saw in Europe but the adoption speed of 12c was quite strong in the quarter as it was in Q3. ","Larry Ellison","Kash, let me give you a little kind of an interesting commentary, I think, on the relationship between PaaS and database adoption on-premise. We are the only company that says, hey, you should \u2013 what you run in the cloud and what you run on premise should be compatible so that you can push a button and move a workload from your private cloud to the Oracle public cloud and back again or you can do development test in the public cloud and do production in our private cloud on premise if you want to. So that has \u2013 we think over time that\u2019s going to dramatically accelerate the adoption of features \u2013 certain features of our database on premise, because they are getting those features in the cloud. They are getting multi-tenancy in the cloud. They are getting the in-memory database features in the cloud and they'll want to have an exact analog in their private cloud on premise. So I think that\u2019s going to actually help keeping our customers current with the latest features of database. ","Kash Rangan ","Wonderful. Safra, any commentary on the license growth rate for databases?","Safra Catz","Well, I want to talk to you actually about the options that did best. As you would expect, everything around security many of our customers are realizing the security options that we have which are really, very, very critical, obviously cyber attacks and all those things and also inside threats or something they are finally really focused on and so database security options were up very significantly like around 30%, that kind of level. And many of our customers are looking now at the multi-tenant option which is available with our newest products and that is doing very well. That means that our customers are moving even themselves into their own private cloud to manage more efficiently. So that is very, very good for us this year \u2013 this quarter.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies.","John DiFucci ","I guess we understand and appreciate the emphasis here on the cloud business. But I\u2019d like to ask a question on what I guess is still the overwhelming majority of your revenue today. And that\u2019s \u2013 I am talking about the on-premise software business. How should we be thinking about your enterprise customer base, what is their behavior like and what do you think it\u2019s going to be moving forward from here? I mean in the past I think we heard both Safra and Mark talk about the sustainability of the Siebel maintenance stream. I guess as enterprises move to the cloud, is this move largely the \u2013 as your customers and I know, Mark, you sort of addressed this a little bit. But are they \u2013 are your customers largely replacing on-premise technology or is it primarily for new implementations today and into the future? I am sorry for the long question but I guess what I am trying to get to is how should we think about the current support steam from that on-premise software, the current support and maintenance into the future?","Safra Catz","So firstly, it\u2019s very important that you understand our support base continues to grow. When we sell new licenses at all, any new license, that increases our base. We do continue to sell billions of dollars of new licenses. Our renewal rates by the way remain extremely high, very very high, historically high rates. So many of our customers are not necessarily \u2013 are not cancelling support and moving everything to the cloud overnight. They are adding cloud capabilities. What would happen invariably is even when they add something in the cloud that they did on premise, they have other uses for many of our licenses that they\u2019ve had before. We would like them over time frankly if we had our way to move everything to the cloud, that would mean probably revenue rates of significantly larger than we are now. But our customers, our base continues to grow \u2013 our customer base continues to grow and our support numbers continue to go up, up obviously 8% just this quarter. ","Mark Hurd","Yes, I think, what Safra said is right. 8% CD growth for the quarter, renewal rates were very strong again, if you will, flat year over year, meaning they were very, very very good. And again I\u2019ll try to go through this again, so to be clear. Most of the new things that we sold or most of what we sold in the cloud was incremental in terms of certainly SaaS applications. So I think again the way to think through this is you are going to have a very large on-premise environment, I think, for a long period of time but workloads are shifting to the cloud, and that is an opportunity for us as we maintain our on-prem base but frankly grow our market share through this shift of the cloud and we can see it. And it\u2019s exciting. Remember, John, too, when we win a SaaS application, we gain all the hardware, all the operating systems, all the database and all the middleware. When we gain PaaS, we get all the database, all the operating system and all the hardware as well. So I think you are going to see on-prem, I think our position on-premise is actually strengthening on a relative basis to what\u2019s in the market and we are now growing faster with these numbers and I don\u2019t know how many ways to go through these numbers to show the market share we are gaining and the speed by which we are accelerating our market position in the cloud. And I think we had a chance to get both. ","Larry Ellison","Let me just add \u2013 summarize what Mark said. Our support base, our install base on-premise is going up 8% and will continue to go up. While our cloud business is experiencing hyper growth 50% of revenue growth, 50% revenue growth, may be more than that. ","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. ","Brent Thill ","Safra, in Q4 did you see a greater percentage of deals in the pipeline that maybe more forecast to go as a perpetual license that meant to shift to a cloud model and therefore that was the weight on the license I think relative to what we all were looking for that, there was a big delta there and just curious if you have any commentary. And then maybe for Mark, as it relates to similar cloud initial deal sizes and duration of these contracts, if you could, maybe point to what you are seeing in terms of some of the contract values that you are seeing throughout the year and any changing characteristics that would be helpful?","Safra Catz","No, that isn\u2019t how it works. It\u2019s not that \u2013 by the time a deal itself is actually listed in the forecast it\u2019s already qualified as to what it\u2019s going to be. The reality is that conversion rates move in the cloud were very very very high and they are \u2013 to some extent took \u2013 was a big focus, that is what we push in the forecast call every week, that\u2019s what we are talking about all the time and that\u2019s what was very clear. In the forecast overall there were many many different shape deals and types of deals and what exactly will close in the quarter, I never know. I have to use my own conversion and closing historical rate. This quarter showed a marked move towards converting the cloud deals. Those did very well. They far exceeded where we thought they would go. So that\u2019s how it worked out. Obviously it doesn\u2019t show up in the revenues because we don\u2019t book them upfront like license does. ","Larry Ellison","To your second question, productivity and ASP, your point about pricing both inclined, so our productivity per rep and our average deal size in cloud went up in the quarter, it went up a bit sequentially as well as it went up year over year. There isn\u2019t another dynamic that when you look at our cloud business, you\u2019ve got several factors going on, Brent. You\u2019ve got one, frankly, the products are just better. They are just getting better and the more mature our sales people, we have more of them and they have longer tenure. They are also simply better trained than they were just even a year or two years ago. And so the combination of this is what\u2019s driven the performance in the cloud. And make no mistake about it. There is a keen sales focus on growing our cloud business. Our cloud business is important for all of the regions that we\u2019ve already talked through.","Now one other point that we haven\u2019t brought up that I think I\u2019d add to is when you look at where we are heading with the cloud, we are going into a year now where we now get frankly more of our portfolio available at the cloud. So we\u2019ve done just what we descried in Q4 which are these numbers that everybody is all excited about. Frankly, with not our entire product line available to us in the cloud. And not even all of the products that we have localized to all of our geographies. So you have a set of factors occurring next fiscal year this coming, the year we are in, where now we have get more salespeople with more tenure, with more references, with now more of our products in line, online if you will in more geographies. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow ","Two quick ones. First, Safra, if I look at sales and marketing, they came in a little bit higher than we had expected. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics there? Are you actually paying out more on cloud provisions et cetera or is it just that Q4 actually was very successful and we can\u2019t see it in revenue because it was sold on cloud? And the other question on PaaS, what are the use cases that you see on PaaS, is it all test and development or are people actually putting software as the production workloads over on to your cloud already?","Safra Catz","So what you are seeing in the sales and marketing percentage is that again, since we are not recognizing the revenue upfront like with license, though we have commissions and things like that with cloud, there is also additional sales expenses that are recognized immediately but they don\u2019t have the corresponding revenue like new license does. So you are just seeing timing differences more than anything else, and that\u2019s impacting a number of our ratios, put that way. ","Mark Hurd","In PaaS, we have a number of things going on. Yes, your point about dev test is correct, there is a lot of dev test use cases for PaaS. But there is more going on in PaaS than just database, service and just dev test. We have released our first \u2013 really BI solution into the market which is now \u2013 digital analyser which now goes head up against [TapWall]. And we had good success with that product in Q4. So again our competitors are shifting now as opposed to in BI on premise where we would have competed with Cognos or Business Objects. We now compete with [TapWall] and that\u2019s in our PaaS results that we\u2019ve described, also Java as a service was strong in the quarter. The collection of those services were 30%, 40% of our PaaS bookings and yes, dev test other than that, dev test is certainly a very big use case for our customers. ","Operator","Your last question will come from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow ","I think we\u2019ve had a lot on the software side of the business and cloud but we haven\u2019t really touched on hardware much. You guys came in actually a little bit above the midpoint of your constant currency guidance on hardware this quarter. Just wondered if you could comment on the trends you are seeing there, engineered systems versus the non-engineered business. And Safra, I know you didn\u2019t give a specific guidance for the hardware business but how are you guys thinking about that going forward?","Mark Hurd","Engineered systems bookings grew double digits in the quarter, very strong, we had over 15, I am doing the stuff \u2013 1500, 1600 incremental systems in the quarter. So very strong in engineered systems as we had very strong growth in North America, very good performance out of one of our Oracle database appliance products. So SuperCluster was very strong in the quarter. We grew in storage in the quarter and this is -- really we are going through a shift in storage now. We released our SAN product FS1 in the quarter which saw some bookings. This is really the first quarter we got any bookings out of FS1 or GFS product, somebody\u2019s renamed that but I haven\u2019t recently \u2013 BS1. I wish they wouldn\u2019t do that to me but so they renamed BS1 \u2013 so I missed the \u2013 but anyway so we had good growth in PaaS \u2013 as well. But \u2013 and then we have sort of server performance that was declines in the quarter and then the growth in the other products that I have described netted to the growth rate that we described. I mean let\u2019s face it, we are the only hardware company growing in the industry. So when you look at the market share numbers, they sort of get to be staggering. We\u2019ve taken over the \u2013 and this is not a question you asked but I am going to say it anyway. In the United States when you look at servers above $15000, the number one company in market share now is Oracle. I believe that will occur region by region by region because of the strength of not just our hardware product line but our software portfolio with it. So it was a good quarter for us in hardware and I would expect that trend to continue. ","Very similar to John\u2019s question, I don\u2019t think we are telling you that there isn\u2019t a non-premise market. Please don\u2019t take that message when we described. But I think the fact that you can take a workload from your on premise data center and now move it seamlessly to the cloud and back and forth to a data center gives us a tremendous advantage. The configuration we have in the cloud, the configuration we have on premise now can be identical. If they were to move workloads back and forth, use that on our hardware in your data center, use that on the very same hardware perhaps in the cloud. We are the only company in the industry that can do this. And so I think this bodes very well for our hardware business, granted in a declining market. But I believe Oracle will gain market share in the declining market.","End of Q&A","Ken Bond","Thank you, Phil. A telephonic replay of this call will be available for 24 hours.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra.","Safra A. Catz","Thanks, Ken. Well, as you can see, we had a very solid quarter, as new software license revenue was up 7%, $2.4 billion, and that's really on top of the enormous 29% increase last year. As I said last quarter, all we really needed to do was focus on our execution and that we did. We exceeded our forecast for new license guidance, we met our forecast for total revenue and we beat the high end of our EPS guidance. Technology new license revenues were $1.7 billion, up 10% in constant currency, 9% in U.S. dollars. Applications were $658 million, up 3% in constant currency and U.S. dollars. As you recall, we saw 34% growth in apps last year and 21% the year before that. So we're very pleased as we're just starting to see the early benefits of Fusion apps, and we've just closed on RightNow and we\u2019ll close on Taleo in April. ","Our license revenue for applications is now 66% higher than it was just 3 years ago as compared to SAP, which is about 32% higher. Geographically, results were very good, as we saw double-digit license growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific, with new license growth of 11% in constant currency and U.S. dollars for the Americas and 11% in JPAC in constant currency, 13% in U.S. dollars. EMEA, not surprisingly given the environment, was essentially flat. But don't forget that a year ago, EMEA reported 19% new license revenue and 47% growth in applications. Once again, the quarter wasn't dependent on any large deals. ","Software license update and product support revenues were $4.1 billion, up 8%. Supported cash rates and software renewal rates continue at the usual very high levels. Hardware systems revenue was $869 million for the quarter, due to the continued reduction in some of our defocused product lines. Hardware gross margins were 51% for the quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was $9.1 billion, up 4% in constant currency, 3% in U.S. dollars. We're extremely pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of $4.2 billion, up 8% as we expanded Q3 margins to match a prior record level of 46.4%, and this now includes a hardware business. With operating margins essentially now back at pre-sung levels, I'm sure you want to know where margins go from here. And while I'm not providing specific guidance, we continue to see ample leverage in our business model. ","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.5%, and the GAAP tax rate was 20.7%, both of which were below my guidance as a result primarily of an increase in income in subsidiaries and countries with lower rates than the United States. EPS for the quarter grew 15% to $0.62 on a non-GAAP basis. Operating cash flow increased to a record $13.5 billion over the last 4 quarters, while free cash flow grew 36% to a record $13 billion. We have nearly $30 billion in cash and marketable securities, this is after paying for our acquisitions and our $1.7 billion buyback executed in the quarter, where we bought back 59.1 million shares. And again, the board declared a dividend of $0.06 per share. ","Now to guidance. Now this guidance builds on a great fourth quarter last year, which had new license up 19%, non-GAAP EPS up 25% and GAAP EPS up 34%. Regardless, the fundamentals of the business remain strong, with pipelines growing significantly. With currency bouncing around, I'm going to give you constant currency guidance but as a convenience for you, I am going to give you where U.S. dollar rates are in the past few days and that actually currently is a negative 3% on licensed growth and total revenue and I have to remind you the rates remain extremely volatile. ","So here goes with the guidance. New software license revenue growth is expected to range from 1% up to 11% up in constant currency. Subtracting the 3 points, you get to negative 2% to 8% in U.S. dollars currently. Now the Hardware business has not turned out to be very seasonal, in fact. So I'm going to give my guidance really sequentially. And what we're seeing for next quarter is hardware revenues a little more -- basically, the low end of my range would be somewhere about where it is this past quarter, Q3, to potentially as much as $100 million to $110 million above where we closed this past quarter. That would be somewhere between I guess $870 million, let's say, to as high as $980 million. ","So total revenue growth on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 1% to 5% in constant currency, subtracting the 3 points, it would be negative 2% to 2% in U.S. dollars. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 1% -- sorry about that. Non-GAAP EPS is expected -- oh, excuse me. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth basically in the same range as non-GAAP. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.78 and $0.83 in constant currency. That would be up from $0.75 last year or $0.76 to $0.81 in reported dollars. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.65 to $0.70 in constant currency. That would be up from $0.62 last year, and $0.62 to $0.67 in U.S. dollars. This guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 25% and a non-GAAP rate of 24.5%. That would be up from a little over 23%, I think, last year. ","With that, I will turn it over to Larry for comments.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Okay, thanks, Safra. In this current quarter, in Q4, after a long period of testing with hundreds of early adopter customers, Oracle cloud platform and applications will be generally available to all customers in Q4. The Oracle cloud includes database and Java platform services, as well as Fusion CRM, HCM and financial cloud applications, all for a simply monthly rental fee. ","We named our cloud the Oracle Secure Cloud because we believe that we've addressed our customers' most serious concern about cloud computing, namely security. The computers that are connected to Oracle Secure Cloud run on multiple -- run in multiple Oracle data centers, and optionally, on computers connected to the Oracle Secure Cloud but installed in the customer's data center behind that customer's secure firewalls. This is especially important to large customers who want the simplicity and convenience of cloud computing but are unwilling to accept the security risks inherent in multi-tenant public Internet clouds. ","Salesforce.com does not offer this kind of security in their cloud. This is a key advantage for us going forward. But by far our biggest application competitor is SAP, not salesforce.com. And SAP does not even offer CRM, HCM and financial applications in the cloud to their large customers. And applications sold to big businesses are the bulk of SAP's revenue. So if you're a large customer that wants to run financial applications in the cloud, SAP does not have a product for you, but we do. Six years ago, we made the decision to write Fusion CRM, HCM and financial applications for the cloud. It will take years for SAP to catch up. In the meantime, the growing popularity of cloud computing gives us a great opportunity to replace SAP as the #1 applications company in the world.","On to you, Mark.","Mark V. Hurd","I just have a couple of quick comments before I turn it back to Ken. I notice from [ph] Exadata recorded for us triple-digit growth. Seven of 8 quarters now with growth over 100% and the one we didn't was 95. Great Exadata wins at Sony and GT and Samsung. Exalogic bookings quadrupled from last year. Our newest product Exalytics has the fastest ramp of any engineered system that we've released. It went GA late in the quarter. It may very well be the strongest value proposition that Oracle has released yet, and we are not seeing competition anywhere. ","Going into Q4, we have a record pipeline for engineered systems and we expect that we will materially surpass all past booking records, and that our bookings for the year will be roughly in line with our original forecast. We talked a little bit about the cloud and Safra mentioned right now closing the quarter. She also mentioned we expect to close Taleo in April. Once closed, our existing SaaS business will exit the year at nearly a $1 billion run rate. By the way, it's a similar number to our planned exit for the year for engineered systems hardware. ","Software support was up sequentially and up annually as attach to renewal rates remain very strong. Hardware support attach rates continue to improve from pre-acquisition levels and we expect to see these go higher over time. Lastly, we added another 1,000 sales and presale people this quarter, and we did this while bringing operating margins back to record levels. Simply put, we are shifting our headcount mix to people who work on developing or selling great technology. We have great products and with the additional sales resources, we're going to drive more organic growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Ken.","Ken Bond","Thanks, Mark. Amber, we'll start the Q&A session, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So the bounce-back in your Q3 results, it definitely makes it look like Q2 was, if you will, just a bad game and perhaps not necessarily a sign of other issues. But there's definitely still some investor question though about things like HANA replacing the transactional database, how does Oracle capture share of big data growth, the shift to cloud. So my question specifically what do you think changed from Q2 to Q3 and do you think any of these perceived threats are actually hurting your business and how do you assess the potential opportunity to grow Oracle revenue?","Safra A. Catz","I'll just talk on the first part of your question. It's clear by these numbers that Q2 was actually an aberration. In fact, as you see sequential growth between Q2 and Q3 is the highest it's been in years, and which would be a sign that something was off frankly in Q2. Because Q2 and Q3 are usually very, very similar growth, similar quarters that sequentially I think new license was up by 16%. So it really does show that what we told you last quarter and that the quarter itself was truly an aberration. We feel very good about really all our product lines and maybe Mark and Larry, you'd like to just comment specifically on competitive situations and otherwise.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Okay, let me start. Two things, you mentioned HANA and you mentioned the cloud and I\u2019m going to just talk about SAP in general. SAP has yet -- again, 6 years ago, we made the decision to rewrite our ERP and CRM suite for the cloud. We made that decision 6 years ago. We called it Fusion. SAP called it Confusion. We think it was the right decision 6 years ago and as cloud computing has grown in popularity, grown in popularity, grown in popularity, we think about thank God that we're sitting here with a complete ERP, CRM, HCM suite of applications, rewritten from scratch, ground-up rewritten from scratch for the cloud and SAP has yet to start. SAP hasn't even started. So if you want to buy financials for the cloud, you can buy it -- and if you're a large company, you can't buy it from SAP, you can buy it from Oracle. We think that's a very big deal. But if you're looking for a complete suite in the cloud, you can get that from Oracle. You can't get that from SAP. That's our core business. Their core business is not the database business, HANA. So let's go into HANA. So SAP decided not to focus on applications but instead, they said, \"Hey, let's go compete with Oracle in the database business and let's build this HANA in-memory system.\" Now the last time SAP decided to compete with us in technology, core technology, they had this thing called NetWeaver and I'm reading all the same questions about NetWeaver that I'm now getting about HANA. My God, SAP is going in the Middleware business, they're a great company, great technology. This NetWeaver thing sounds fantastic. And at the time, Oracle was not a leader in Middleware. The leader in Middleware at the time was IBM. Well, what\u2019s happened? Since the NetWeaver assault on Oracle, Oracle has moved into the #1 position passing IBM. We're now the #1 Middleware Company in the world. By the way, we had a great Middleware quarter. We're the #1 Middleware Company in the world and NetWeaver isn't on the chart. Vanished. Now when SAP, and specifically Hasso Plattner, said they're going to build this in-memory database system and compete with Oracle. I said, duh, get me the name of that pharmacist, they must be on drugs. And that was interpreted by Hasso as saying Larry Ellison doesn't believe in in-memory database. Quite the contrary, we've been working on in-memory databases for the last 10 years. We have the world-leading in-memory database. It\u2019s called TimesTen, and that TimesTen product is the foundation of our Exalytics system, which is our direct competitor with the HANA appliance. The reason I wanted to get the name of his pharmacist was not because I don't believe in in-memory databases. I don't believe SAP is equipped to compete with us in a database business when we've been working on it for 10 years. This is arguably our core competency, database management. And SAP is going to beat us in data management with HANA? I'm going to turn it over to Mark to discuss all of the HANA losses we've experienced since the introduction of that SAP product.","Mark V. Hurd","I don't have anything to report. Bringing torp [ph] back for a second, I think we have -- listen, we've been looking out in the market. We hear all the rhetoric and the noise and so I don't want to make it sound like we're in denial that there's stuff out there, people talking. My only problem with it, Jason, is I just can't find them. I just can't find them. I can't find buyers. I had one report -- listen, I mean, you know this. We've got a very large field organization. So I asked them, send me all the data on real competitive deals and I'm going to stay up all night reading them. The good thing is I got to bed on time. So listen, I'm not trying to tell you -- we're very vigilant. I don't want to say we dismiss it. But right now for us, products that we've got and I meant what I said earlier. Exalytics is going into a market as we see it with very little competition. We have hundreds of Exalytics sales. We can't -- and again Exalytics is the competitor with HANA, the HANA appliance. And one of the nice things about Exalytics is you plug it in and your existing Hyperion EPM system runs faster. Your existing Oracle BI runs faster. With HANA, one of the problems is you plug in HANA and then you start to write programs, because it's not compatible with anything. Exalytics is. That's one huge advantage. But forget the huge advantage. Let's say you write a custom program for Exalytics and a custom program for HANA. Well, I believe we will run dramatically faster. We should -- I mean we've been working on this in-memory database technology for more than a decade. They just brought this thing out of the lab. How can -- we don't think it's a serious threat to us at all. One thing I would say, Jason, so we probably talked about this enough but I would say I do like is the fact that they're talking about engineered systems and the fact that it's going to play, I believe, a bigger and bigger role in core computing in IT. And IBM too. I think you see them coming out saying the same thing. I think what happens when you take a leadership position as we've had and I've talked about this before, it reminds me of when I was at Teradata years ago, we had an architecture that was different from everybody, one of the best things that happened to us was IBM coming out with an architecture very similar to ours, if you will, validating the approach that we're bringing to market. Very similar here to have these companies, these big companies now come to market say, \"Yes, we have engineered systems, too.\" I guess, great, it validates the market for what we've already brought to market and continue to improve and enhance.","Lawrence J. Ellison","One last comment on HANA just to emphasize. HANA does not compete with the Oracle Database. I know on their roadmaps, they say that eventually HANA will compete with the Oracle Database. They'll never make it that far down the road because what HANA does right now it competes with Exalytics. It's an in-memory query accelerator is what it is and it competes with Exalytics and it cannot -- it will not successfully compete with Exalytics and it will never even begin to compete with the Oracle Database. I don't want to spend time now explaining all the recovery issues, all the security issues, how difficult it would be for us, for them, for anybody to take this in-memory technology and make it a legitimate competitor to any database, let alone the Oracle Database.","Operator","We'll go next to Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My question, I think, is for Mark. It has to do with the changes on the sales organization. If my numbers are right, you grew your sales headcount by about 17% net in the first half and also made some tweaks to the selling plans. Another 1,000 this quarter. Could you maybe give us your thoughts on the philosophy around the growth and changes in the sales organization and where you think you are in terms of ramping your capacity?","Mark V. Hurd","Well, I think we've done a lot of it. So to be very frank, we set a plan in motion to accelerate our hiring. As you've seen, we try to do it within the context of a very disciplined expense structure. See, our expenses for the quarter are roughly flat within the context of the sizing, increased sizing in our salesforce. As we said last quarter, we were up 1,700. This is additive to that. Now just to be clear, this is salespeople and the presale people that support them. So it's a combination of both. But we have some more hiring to do but I would say we've been very successful in getting done what we've done and also, we believe we've brought in quality people. We are a very attractive destination to hire to, and we have taken advantage of that. So again strategically, we're adding more salespeople but we're also adding more specialized salespeople. They\u2019re salespeople very focused on the products that they represent, they're experts at the products they represent and we're going to take advantage of that. And now force a -- push higher productivity out of those people that we've hired. So we think we have a lot of gas in the tank to drive organic growth given the hiring we've done.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","We hear a lot of big data as an industry trend. I just wanted to get to the engineered systems marketing. You talked about Exalogic quadrupling the bookings on a year-over-year basis. I'm wondering if you could give us some color on how Exadata is doing at this point in time. It sounds like I think you sound pretty excited about Exalytics. And just wondering how we should think about the ramp for Exalytics. What kind of a pipeline do you have and what is the initial uptake looking like within your OBIEE customer base for the Exalytics product?","Mark V. Hurd","Okay, I appreciate the -- it sounded like almost a 9-part question. I'll do my best, Kash, to try to get at it and I tried to say this. I think around here, we're just really excited about Exalytics. The Exalytics product was GA-ed a couple of weeks before the end of the quarter? A couple of weeks before the end of the quarter, we got it out. Frankly, we started to sell it, frankly, just pre-GA, we had so much interest in it and we had very strong bookings in that last 10-day period. We're off and running in the U.S. We're off and running in Europe. We're ramping up now in Asia. We're aligning that to our BI salesforce as Larry described, the ability for us to take existing Oracle BI applications and they just run. So compared to this other thing that was talked about earlier where you buy it and then you start programming on it, this is a completely different value proposition than the thing that was being asked about earlier. Exalogic has ramped. It quadrupled as I described in my comments earlier. It is having tremendous success in that SOA area, as well as with our applications and the ability for it to now plug in Oracle applications, in some cases run 4x and 5x faster than you were running Oracle applications before you deployed Exalogic into that architecture. Exadata has continued to ramp and again, we saw another one of these gains where we doubled and as I talked about over the last several quarters, we've done that continually every quarter. I expect a very, very strong Exadata quarter in Q4 as well.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Mark, Exadata doubled on a year-over-year basis?","Mark V. Hurd","Yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. First, to Safra and Mark, the Applications business in the U.S. really bounced back very strongly this quarter and performed quite well internationally given what you mentioned being just tough comps year-over-year. What's driving that sustained growth in applications and could you just also comment on just the early feedback you're getting on Fusion apps? And then just a second one to Larry, some of your competitors are making a pretty big deal about just \"pure object-oriented development,\" and how they believe this not only puts Oracle Fusion apps but also I think Oracle Database at a disadvantage. In fact, some have gone so far as to say that there's no need for a database anymore. So could you just give us your perspective on this, too?","Safra A. Catz","Okay, well, for us, nothing particular on applications for next quarter. We are still -- remain very bullish. We think we're going to be very good. I think you'll be very happy by the end of Q4. On the software side, of course, we have -- it's our seasonally very, very strong quarter and we had extremely high database -- applications growth last Q4. So we have a very tough compare with 22% in applications last year in Q4 in recorded growth rates. But we're very bullish about applications in Q4 for us. Very.","Mark V. Hurd","Before Larry gets into the other question, I would say in Fusion, we are ramping HCM now. HCM has been in the market. We have references, we've got our salespeople trained, deployed. We're aggressively at the HCM market. Mentioned the acquisition of RightNow, which is now fully integrated into Oracle. We have released our sales product within CRM. We're ramping that similarly to what we did HCM probably 4 to 5 months ago, and we are starting to win a material amount of the deals in HCM. I would say we're very encouraged by our progress in HCM over the last 3 or 4 months. So very good progress to report there.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Okay, the question is object-oriented programming and does object-oriented programming eliminate the need for a database? Well, object-oriented programming has gone on very, very long time. It was invented kind of at Xerox PARC with the alto, so it was invented in the late '70s, early 1980s. This is 30 years later and there are still databases. Fusion Applications is written in 100% Java and HTML 5. I would say that's consistent and it runs on the Oracle Database. Salesforce.com, Java and the Oracle Database; NetSuite, Java and the Oracle Database; Taleo, Java and the Oracle Database. RightNow, for their large customers, it's all the Oracle Database. The only cloud company I know, the only cloud company I know that decided to forego having a database, thinks that database technology isn't necessary anymore, the only one on the planet that I know of is Workday. And so Workday doesn't use a database. They use their own technology. Let me tell you one thing. It's very hard to write reports, ad hoc reports, queries and certain things on an underlying object database. Again, I don't want to go into all of the details but -- by the way, the Oracle Database has full support for object-oriented programming. The Oracle Database ceased being a pure relational database many, many years ago. We're an object database, we're an XML database, we support all different kinds of media. And all different types, we support video. We support freetax [ph], unstructured data, as well as structured data, objects as well as relations. We support all sorts of different data types. But the fact that Workday built its own database is I think one of the 2 fundamental mistakes that they made. The other fundamental mistake is their UI is all Flash. It's all Flash UI, Adobe Flash, which is not supported on the iPad and is not supported on the iPhone and they have begun the process to rewrite completely their UI. They said they built some special stuff for iPad, iPhone but eventually they're going to have to move away from Flash to HTML 5, I believe. Otherwise, they're going to maintain 2 separate UIs, one for iPads and iPhones and the other for Android and personal computers, which makes no sense. So that was one mistake. A much worse mistake was the fact that they are alone, of all the modern cloud companies to think that they can do without a database. I think it's a fundamental mistake and it's going to create all sorts of problems for them down the road. They're basically, this small company, is basically going to have to build all of their own database technology. I mean they need recovery. They need to create processing. They need [indiscernible]. They need all of these things. They're going to have to build out that tool set themselves rather than relying on us like salesforce does, rather than relying on us like NetSuite does, rather than relying on us like SuccessFactors does, as SAP does. They all rely on us. But Workday, they're going to rely on themselves. It's a small company, making 2 architectural mistakes right out of the box.","Operator","We'll go next to John DiFucci with JPMorgan.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Mark, I have a question, a follow-up to Kash's question. We're actually -- we continue to -- I have a part 11 to Kash's 10-part question. We continue to hear of improved traction in the field for Exadata specifically and actually, we're hearing some early excitement around Exalytics and even some T4 traction. But obviously, the bleed off of the commodity hardware continues and this more than is offsetting the traction of the other products on the top line. I guess the question is when are we going to see this reverse? I realize the timing has been difficult to predict this but when does the commodity hardware business stabilize? And then I just have a quick follow-up to that when you're done.","Lawrence J. Ellison","I'm going to repeat what I said and interrupt Mark, and say that next year, our overall Hardware business will be a growth story. That Exalogic, Exadata, Exalytics will have scaled to the point where it's big enough and a rapid growth to more than offset the decline in some of the commodity lines like the x86 line. That we just don't care about. What we care about is where we enrich the hardware with our own IP, namely software, silicon. T4 is doing very well and it's doing extremely well. And we're about to refresh the rest of the SPARC line. And I think when we do that, we're going to be in much better shape. And that's going to happen around the end of this calendar year, refreshing the entire -- the remainder of the high end of the SPARC line. Also, we've stopped reselling OSI logic disks. We don't care about that. And that's in decline. Instead, we're selling our own ZFS technology. And we sold over 1,000 ZFS systems this last quarter, up I think from 200 a year ago for 5x. And now it's a small number, but it's very, very important and this competes directly with NetApp. We bought a company called Pillar and their sales are up. This is -- and we get a new Pillar -- so we intend to be competitive in storage with our own IP. We intend to be competitive in servers with our own IP. Next fiscal year, our hardware business should be a growth story. It will be. Safra will see to it that it will be.","Mark V. Hurd","I think, John, you got the story right, the way you described it. I'll just add to Larry's point. I'd add ZFS and we've got a franchise tape business that we're focused on. But we're refreshing the SPARC line. The good news is the T4 is superb. The bad news is the price performance of the T4 is so superb that it's a very attractive value proposition that actually brings lower revenue in per unit. But it's an exciting product that's really new and fresh into the SPARC base. So it's a very positive thing from that perspective. So yes, I think we've got good traction on the XO products. We'll be focused on our original forecast as I described earlier on the XO side and next year is a growth story for us.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","If I could just clarify because, Larry, I think you said at the end of this calendar year or after, that's when you'll start to see growth. But you said next fiscal year. So for the year, we'll see growth, we'll actually start to see on a quarterly basis at the end of the calendar year or thereabouts, we'll start to see that turn to growth?","Lawrence J. Ellison","No, I think we hope it to get there before that. That would be the second quarter. So we hope we get there before that. But for the next fiscal year, I mean there are no guarantees but we're pretty confident, next fiscal year this is a growth story. And by the way, it's a top line growth story, which means it's a pretty spectacular bottom line growth story.","John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it, got it. And then if I might, just -- Mark, just to clarify, you made a statement during your prepared remarks -- this is the question. Mark, you said engineered systems bookings will be in line with original forecast. Just so there's no confusion around that, can you clarify what that means as far as original forecast for engineered systems bookings?","Mark V. Hurd","Sure. We talked about getting to the billion-dollar run rate. We will do that. Certainly be right around there. We talked aspirationally about the ability to triple the sales and I actually said that was an aspirational goal. We'll be in the ballpark. We still got a shot, we got Q4 and we're still on track to try to get that done. So again, I know we had some discussion in the last call where there were people showing up with various numbers. We have not changed our view of this from the beginning. Our view has been this is an exciting story and unfortunately around here, we've gotten used to it and I think sometimes we forget just how exciting it is to have products like this in your product line to grow like this. So we still got a shot to make that aspirational goal for the year and we're going to drive hard in Q4 to get that done.","Operator","We'll go next to Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A question for Larry on the applications business\/cloud. The Street has some concerns that you're in the transition from the old to new and as it relates to Fusion Apps, how do you think about reaching the tipping point in reference-ability? I think you have roughly 70,000 application customers. In the last update, we heard you mention a couple hundred customers are deploying. Can you just give us your view and I had a quick follow-up for Safra.","Lawrence J. Ellison","Well again, the nice thing about Fusion Applications, it's not a rip-and-replace story. So you can deploy parts of the Fusion suite and in concert with the applications you own in the premise [indiscernible] the E-Business Suite. You can connect that to our salesforce automation suite or you can connect that to our HCM suite in the cloud. So it's not a matter of you having to take out everything you currently have and replace it with cloud computing. You can do this gradually. And that's what we see our customers doing, in fact. A lot of the customers that are running in Fusion Applications today in production also have a lot of our on-premise applications. So we think we can manage this transition gracefully because the technology allows for that graceful transition, the gradual introduction of cloud applications, displacing a portion of E-Business Suite and another portion of the E-Business Suite. And in 3, 4, 5 steps, you can get entirely into the cloud if that's what you want to do. I mean so there are customers who are quite happy with the on-premise stuff. But we will be offering the full complement of Fusion Applications to all of our customers in Q4 and we expect adoption broadly in our base. But this could be a multistep process, especially for these large customers.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, and real quick just for Safra, on the Q4 license guide, the Street's original reaction was it felt fairly conservative. Is that just because of tough comps or is there something else that you're seeing that's giving you some reservation?","Safra A. Catz","No, I lived through Q3 with you all -- Q2, sorry, Q2 with you all and I didn't enjoy that. So I'm looking at close rates and just liking Q3 a lot more than I liked Q2, and I'd like to like Q4. So I'm not seeing anything negative or otherwise. I am guiding to a number that I think is in that range using somewhat conservative close rates for Q4, okay? Do you understand me?","Operator","We'll go next to Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","There was a nice re-acceleration in technology licenses during the quarter, returning to 10% constant currency growth for the first time this fiscal year. Anything in particular driving that re-acceleration and how sustainable do you think it is going forward?","Mark V. Hurd","The Exadata, Exalogic, Exalytics is required not only by the hardware but there are software components as well. And one of the things we love about this business, engineered systems, is not only does it put us in the high margin hardware business, it also makes our software even more competitive than it was before. So we're seeing -- it's helping accelerate our Database business. It's getting very, very interesting to look at our BI business and how Exalytics is going to help our BI business, how Exalogic helps our Middleware business and our Application business. So there are great synergies with our engineered systems. Again, we talk about it enabling us to be very competitive in the Hardware business. That is true. It's also making us more competitive in the Software business, especially technology.","Operator","That does concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Ken Bond for any additional or closing remarks.","Ken Bond","Thank you, operator. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call and we look forward to speaking with you.

As reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Kenneth Bond - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.","On the call today are Executive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. As reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today.","As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Ada Catz - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.","As you can imagine, we are very, very pleased with our results, as software and cloud, cloud SaaS and PaaS, total hardware, total revenue and earnings per share were all above the midpoint of my CD [Constant Dollar] guidance. As you probably remember, I didn't provide U.S. dollar guidance for Q3, given the unusually high volatility in exchange rates. The currency headwind ended up being 6% for software and cloud revenues as well as total revenue, 7% for total hardware revenue, and $0.06 a share \u2013 and $0.06 for earnings per share. Currencies continue to move significantly so my comments today generally reflect constant dollar growth rates, which is how we look at the business.","Cloud SaaS, and PaaS revenue was $375 million, up 33% from last year. Bookings were again over 100%, adding to the momentum, which is helping drive SaaS, PaaS revenue growth. Now when bookings turn into revenue depends on many factors, but one thing is clear, our momentum in Cloud bodes very, very well for the future. Cloud infrastructure as a service revenue was $155 million, up 32%.","Overall, our Cloud results were much, much better than expected as we are clearly growing faster than Salesforce. We're more than three times the size of Workday now. Software and Cloud revenues were $7.2 billion, up 7% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove nearly half of total company revenue at $4.7 billion, up 8% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing install base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenue was $2 billion while we continued to enable our customers with their ongoing transition to Cloud.","Looking at GAAP Software and Cloud results by region, the Americas grew 7%, EMEA grew 9% and Asia-Pacific grew 4%. Total hardware including hardware support grew 5% with hardware system product revenue of $712 million and hardware support revenue of $587 million. Engineered Systems saw double-digit revenue growth on the strength of our product portfolio. Obviously, we continue to gain share against IBM and HP, whose high-end server businesses continue their decline.","For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 6% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 4% from last year, and the operating margin was 46% in constant currency. That we are able to maintain our industry-leading operating margin while growing our Cloud business more than 30% is a testimony to the strength of our business model.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.7%, and EPS was $0.68 in U.S. dollars, growing 9% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 20.8%, and GAAP EPS was $0.56 in U.S. dollars. As I mentioned earlier, but for the currency moves, EPS would have been $0.06 higher. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.5 billion. Capital expenditures continue to be a bit higher as we position cloud orders and build out for the enormous fourth quarter SaaS and PaaS growth we anticipate.","Just to put it into perspective, when you compare the same nine months last year to the nine months, the first nine months of the year this year, our capital expenditure is up about $350 million. That's all. We now have over $43 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $11.5 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $6.4 billion, down slightly due to currency, but in constant dollars, it actually grew 6%. Within short-term deferred revenue is $321 million for SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Cloud services.","As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation, as both are critically important.","This quarter, we repurchased 46.1 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased nearly 200 million shares for a total of $8.1 billion and we've paid out dividends of $2.1 billion for a total that is more than 75% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 25% today from $0.12 to $0.15 per share.","Now to the guidance. First of all, given the continued high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect results, but as we just don't know how much, I'm going to again provide constant currency guidance only.","Secondly, our customers are clearly embracing Oracle PaaS faster than we expected, which is actually great for us. Just to give you a little bit of insight on how we look at the business, for every $1 million of license we sell, we expect to collect another $1 million from support over five years for a total of $2 million, while for every $1 million of PaaS we sell, we actually expect to collect $5 million over five years. That's what we're looking at in our business, and though it may have some short-term effect, it's actually already showing up in the revenues. So there we go.","SaaS and PaaS on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 26% to 30%. On a GAAP basis, SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 27% to 31%. Cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 29% to 33%. Software and Cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, new software license, and software support is expected to grow 2% to 6%. Hardware systems revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes hardware system products and hardware system support is expected to be between negative 2% and positive 8%.","Total revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 1% to 6%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.90 and $0.96 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.76 and $0.82 in constant currency. And again, all of my guidance today is in constant currency and assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% and a GAAP tax rate of 23%. Of course, it may end up being different, but that's what we have got in our model right now.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.","Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Safra. As usual, I'll try to give you some numbers behind the numbers. I think overall a very solid quarter for Oracle and a great Cloud quarter for Oracle. As Safra did, I'll give you numbers in CD.","SaaS, PaaS revenue grew 33%. Bookings ARR grew 130%, double last year, and up double digits sequentially. Fusion bookings ERP, HCM and SFA all grew triple digits. Fusion bookings have grown more than 200% every quarter this year.","We added 800 brand-new SaaS customers, nearly 800. Nearly 530 existing customers expanded their cloud services in the quarter; in HCM, 220 new customers; in customer experience, 407 new customers; in ERP, 160 new customers. ERP SaaS install base is multiple the size of Workday. We're adding customers at more than 10x the rate of Workday. Less than 25% of our ERP SaaS wins involve any on premise Oracle ERP customer, meaning that over 75% are net new to Oracle. I would give you a stat on SAP, but we never see them in cloud ERP.","PaaS, more than 400 new PaaS customers in the quarter. Bookings up 200% sequentially. Q4 in PaaS is going to be very big. Premise software grew 6%. We expect continued growth. Engineered systems grew 15% in the quarter. We sold more than 1,000 systems, including over 500 Exadata units booked. Given competitor results, we're taking huge market share. Oracle will be the leader in high-end servers this year.","And wrapping up, our cloud revenue is already above a $2 billion run rate, our SaaS\/PaaS pipeline is already large and growing rapidly, and it's growing faster than what you're seeing in the bookings, that being the pipeline. We now expect Q4 bookings of $300 million, $50 million higher than before. We also expect FY 2015 bookings growth to be greater than 100%.","You probably remember when Larry actually gave 50% growth in bookings as guidance at Financial Analyst Meeting, and we're going to double that number. Clearly, the migration to cloud is happening faster than we expected, and to Safra's point, that's great news for Oracle. It's great news for our customers and great news for our investors.","And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Larry.","Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer","Thank you, Mark.","This quarter Oracle sold cloud ERP systems to 160 new customers. That's more ERP customers than Workday has acquired in all the years they've been in the cloud business. Not one of our 160 cloud ERP deals was competitive with SAP. As Mark said, we just don't see them in the market. By the end of this quarter, Oracle will have sold over 1,000 cloud ERP systems. We are on our way to building the largest ERP business in the cloud.","Oracle now has a cloud revenue run rate of well over $2 billion a year. We're already the world's second-largest SaaS and PaaS company. On our last quarterly conference call, I predicted that in our fiscal year 2016 Oracle would likely sell more SaaS and PaaS new business than Salesforce.com. Well, I was way too cautious.","Sorry, I'm just checking my notes here. Did I lose the call for second?","Safra Ada Catz - Chief Executive Officer","No. You're here.","Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer","You're good.","Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer","Okay. Let me just back up one second, and I think this is important. On our last quarterly conference call, I predicted that in our fiscal year 2016 Oracle would likely sell more SaaS and PaaS new business than Salesforce.com. I was way too cautious and conservative. Our cloud business is growing a lot faster than even I expected. Our cloud bookings are now growing at over 100% per year, so I'd like to revise my prediction.","I now believe that Oracle will sell more new SaaS and PaaS business than Salesforce.com in this current calendar year, 2015. It's going to be close, but I think we're going to sell more in the cloud than they do this year. I suspect that might come as a big surprise to a lot of people out there. You won't have to wait very long to find out who's going to win this.","With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator.","Kenneth Bond - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we'll go ahead and begin the Q&A portion of the call now, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question will come from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason A. Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. I actually wanted ask Larry a couple questions about the database business. First off, Larry, I would love if we could get a little bit of insight on 12c adoption. The second thing is I'd like to talk a little bit about some the use cases driving the PaaS growth? And if you can indulge me, maybe the last question is I'd be remiss not to ask for a competitive assessment of S\/4HANA from SAP. Thanks.","Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer","Okay. Well, let's start with the 12c adoption rates. The most important new feature we probably put in the database and sometimes in terms of customer enthusiasm is our in-memory database feature. And that, along with the multi-tenancy feature, are the two pieces that are really driving 12c adoption to higher rates than anything we've seen in about \u2013 for a very, very long time. So I think people are moving very quickly. Again, it takes years for people to move to the next version of the database. People are very cautious but they're moving more quickly than historical precedent to adopt 12c, for two big reasons. One is multi-tenancy and the other is our in-memory database option. So that's going exceptionally well.","The use cases that are spurring adoption of Oracle, the Oracle database in the Cloud is the very simple fact you can take any workload, any database that you currently have running in your data center and move your database with the push of a button and move your application with the push of a button and run it in the Oracle Cloud. Nobody else can do that.","If you look at the other PaaS vendors, or the second-biggest PaaS vendor, or, well, actually maybe they're the biggest PaaS vendor still. I'm not sure they breakout their number. Salesforce.com PaaS is based on proprietary technology that allows you to send salesforce.com applications. Our PaaS, our cloud platform as a service is based on two products: Java, the world's most popular programming language and an industry-standard, and the Oracle database, the world's most popular relational database and an industry-standard.","We have enormous on premise usage, both Java and the Oracle database. And now people don't have to decide where they're going to run things. They can do tests and development in the Oracle Cloud and run production in on-premise. And then they can decide if they need more capacity, they can go from on-premise into the Cloud and back to on-premise. We're the only ones that allow you to move data and workload back and forth between the Cloud and on-premise. That's the primary use case we think that's going to drive Oracle PaaS to be the number one PaaS in the cloud very, very quickly.","The third question is \u2013 as for HANA in the cloud, well, very simply, and I talked to a lot of people at SAP actually about S\/4HANA in the cloud and people who have recently been at SAP. And you've got to understand one thing, this is the same old SAP. This is all written in ABAP. There's 30-year-old code in S\/4 business suite. There is nothing new about this. They're simply hosting it on someone else's computer.","I also can't find a website where you log on and try it. Everyone else lets you log on \u2013 you know, let's you log on, you go to a website if you want to buy our stuff, you want by SaaS, you want to buy PaaS, you go to the website, you get provisioned, and you go. Not so with SAP. This is 30-year-old code renamed S\/4HANA. Now they did add a new user interface called Fiori to the old code but that's all they did.","They did add another database that they support. They now support in addition to Oracle and Sybase and IBM DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server, they also support HANA. That's it. They've added one new database, they've added a more modern UI, all the old code in the middle is written in ABAP. Ask them. It's written in ABAP. It's 30 years old. We don't see them as a Cloud competitor. We actually almost never talk about them except when we get a question on the call. That's it.","Kenneth Bond - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please?","Operator","All right. And your next question will come from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Great. Thank you for the question. I actually had two of them. I wanted to know if you all could discuss, I think you mentioned it a little bit but go into a little bit more detail about how you're seeing the competitive environment changing versus salesforce.com and Workday, kind of what you've noticed over the last even three to six months. And then, Safra, I might've missed it, I apologize, but could you talk about your support growth in constant currency, please? I think I might have missed the number.","Safra Ada Catz - Chief Executive Officer","Sure. How about, Mark, you do...","Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I will start on the competitive environment. I would say that the competitive environment with Workday is different in HR than in ERP, EPM. In ERP, EPM our position is extremely strong. I would not call Workday competitive in that market at all. So let's put that aside.","In the context of HCM, I think with each subsequent release of HCM, whether it had been release 7, release 8, release 9, and now release 10, we have simply engineered now a better product than Workday. And so I think, from an HCM perspective, head-to-head, they are in the United States, some strong fights. I think as our awareness, the education of our sales force and our references have gotten better, we now win more than half the deals in the United States. Outside the United States, our win rate goes up actually exponentially because of the breadth of our distribution in those markets. So that is sort of how I would characterize Workday.","Also, any deal that comes up that's multi-pillar, so in many cases you wind up with an ERP competitive environment that then actually many times can drag in HR, and so we think competitively, Heather, the fact that we have ERP and EPM in the cloud, in SaaS with a strong lead, also benefits our HCM business as well. So out engineering, out distributed in almost all the world, as I've described big lead in ERP, EPM where I would not describe Workday as extremely competitive.","Salesforce, I think perhaps different. Salesforce is clearly the incumbent in most accounts, not Oracle. We are, frankly, the guy coming up with a challenger capability, and we now bring a suite of capability with marketing in addition to sales automation. And we do a lot of things that they don't do. We really come to the customer with a different approach. As opposed to trying to help the customer basically report what the sales force is bidding on, we actually come to market trying to help the sales force, being our customers' sales forces, sell more stuff all the way from automating a marketing campaign to the actual process by which they communicate to the customer, get information about the customer, and actually go through a whole engineering selling process with the customer.","And this is proven, you've heard it with our numbers. Our sales automation solutions in the quarter were superb. Marketing had a fantastic quarter. We are the leader in marketing. We are challenging very aggressively in sales automation, and we expect to give them a run for their money in every sales automation deal in the planet, but our differentiation, Heather, comes from bringing a suite of capability to help the sales \u2013 or our customers' sales organizations sell.","Safra Ada Catz - Chief Executive Officer","Okay. And Heather, as far sequential growth in support, in constant currency it's up sequentially between 1% and 2%. The only change you see in the tables is as a result of currency. So sequentially up in software license updates and product support.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. Thank you very much.","Kenneth Bond - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel Nicolaus.","Brad R. Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Oh, hi. Thanks. Sorry about that. Just one quick question, Safra. Can you give us a sense of what the FX impact was on cash flow in the quarter?","Safra Ada Catz - Chief Executive Officer","So about \u2013 it was \u2013 well, about half of the decline in cash flow, a little bit more, I think, was actually entirely currency. And a little of it, frankly, was tax payments that under circumstances in some jurisdictions where you pay and then you discuss it. And then a little of it actually ended up being an inventory buildup that we're doing right now, about $100 million of inventory buildup in preparation for all of the engineered systems that go out in Q4. So we do the buildup of the pieces in Q3. So I would say, I know you asked about currency but currency is about half of it.","Brad R. Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question will come from Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hi. Thank you very much. Mark, could you talk about the Engineered Systems business? Certainly growth of 15% is outpacing the market, but how is the split of business between the quarter rack, half rack, full rack, or if you want to look at it based on the products, Exadata, Exalogic, Exalytics, how is that shaping up? Where do you think the mix shift in this business is going to look like in the next 12 months or so? What I'm really trying to get an angle on is can the business get better as a result of greater 12c adoption as well? Thank you.","Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so let me \u2013 there were a lot of questions tied up there, so let me try to hit as many as I can. First, I think to your point, when you look at our competitor results in high-end servers, we're gaining a ton of share. So just to make sure \u2013 you said growing a bit faster. All of our competitors really in this space are highly negative. And as we've talked about growth was 15% in the quarter, it is spread between, I would say, a solid Exadata quarter all the way around. We grew in Exadata, and this is going against, I know you know this, Kash, fairly tough comparisons with the success of Exadata last year. But we had very strong performance on some of our new engineered systems. So it was pretty well-dispersed.","We had strong growth in SuperCluster in the quarter. We had strong growth in our Oracle Database Appliance. We had good growth in our Big Data Appliance, which is our Hadoop Oracle appliance that we brought to market. Our Zero Data, one of my favorite named products that we have in the company, the Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance, contributed growth in the quarter. So the suite of products that we've brought to market in Engineered Systems as a group had a really strong quarter and while some of the numbers are small coming off of a baseline, they all contributed and they are all growing and in aggregate, we grew 15%. So I think our pipelines are up overall, and so we feel great about the quarter Engineered Systems delivered and great about our pipeline.","Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","And the hardware refresh as it relates to 12c mainstream adoption, could you get a benefit there?","Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, I think, listen, we've seen a strong uptake of \u2013 well I shouldn't say that. Let me say it another way. The beginnings of the uptake of 12c, I believe that also helps, and it also helps in the context of what we see as 12c and the emergence of private clouds that exist within our customers where you see many of these architectural moves to these engineered systems as well.","Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Wonderful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura.","Richard Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks. So, Larry, two questions. First, as we talk to companies that are native to the SaaS market, they indicate that they'll continue to win business because they have an inherent advantage being natively built for the cloud with ease of implementation and ease of use. And I wondered if you could comment on how you think you stack up now and future releases of Fusion, if there's more to be done on that front? And then secondly, you talked about in-memory in...","Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer","Can I interrupt you, right, on that one? Was the question, some people are \u2013 SaaS \u2013 people are saying SAP was natively built for the cloud?","Richard Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","No, no. These are the native SaaS companies I'm talking about.","Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer","Oh, the native SaaS companies. Okay. I misunderstood. Okay. Got it.","Richard Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Yeah.","Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer","Okay. Well, let me just answer the first part of your question now. We made a big announcement almost 10 years ago that we were rebuilding all of our applications for the cloud. Now, it wasn't called the cloud 10 years ago, it was called SaaS. But we said that we were rebuilding everything on this thing called Fusion, and networks, were going to rebuild our middleware for the cloud, build our applications on top of our cloud middleware, and change our database for the cloud, make it multi-tenant, make it in-memory, do all of those things. We started a project 10 years ago to rewrite everything. When \u2013 Fusion ERP, every single line of code is brand-new. Fusion HCM, every single line of code is brand-new. I can go on and on, but all of these we \u2013 they are completely rewritten for the cloud, as is our database, and our database was not completely rewritten, we added specific features to the database to make it work properly in the cloud, the most prominent of which is the multi-tenancy feature.","We think we put multi-tenancy at the right level of the stack in the database rather than multi-tenancy in the application which creates real security problems which I'm not going to go into. But we think we have a huge advantage over someone like Workday that doesn't have a database. Workday kind of build their own little database. And that's what you're buying into when you buy Workday. We built our own little database. It's called Oracle. Workday has its own programming technology. We haven't, we used this programming technology called Java.","So \u2013 and we built everything, everything from scratch, every, I am telling you, every single line of code in Fusion HCM is new for the cloud every single line of code where Fusion ERP is new for the cloud. And those new cloud applications are based on by far the strongest platform. Workday doesn't even have a platform that they sell. They have no platform. They have the platform that they kind of use internally. Salesforce has a platform that we also think is not competitive with our platform.","So you have to be very specific as what advantages, what advantages these small companies think they have over us in the Cloud when we have, I think, very clearly, the strongest platform based on industry standards and years and years of experience. We've adapted that for the Cloud.","I'll give you an example of how strong our Cloud platform is. Salesforce.com uses our Cloud platform. NetSuite uses our Cloud platform. In fact, every single cloud company of size, the top 10, nine of them use our database in the Cloud. Workday is the only one that doesn't. But tell me again the advantages they think they have?","Richard Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Ease of implementation and ease-of-use.","Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer","I don't \u2013 ease of implement is easy to say, but we're getting our ERP customers \u2013 can you tell me, ease of implementation of what? And we think our Cloud ERP is very, is the best-of-breed in Cloud ERP. We think our Cloud HCM is now the best-of-breed in cloud HCM in the areas of user interface, which is usually what the people mean by ease-of-use. Better adaptive technology, which makes the implementation very, very rapid, a very rapid implementation, very low cost implementations we think are competitive with anyone out there. In fact, one of the reasons why our consulting business keeps getting smaller is because our applications implementations take so much less time and effort.","Richard Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Larry, the second question was with in-memory capabilities, do you think it's possible that we see a lot more innovation in terms of the type of business processes that we can automate with this next generation of apps in the Cloud?","Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer","Well, I think a lot of things that used to take a long time will take less time. So manufacturers will run MRP much faster than they used to. People that used to get reports overnight will get those reports instantaneously so they'll have access to more information. I think there are some very interesting applications in terms of security for immediate detection of intrusion, being able to analyze the data so quickly we actually can do a better job in security, that's one of the big things that we've been working on for some time. I think there are a lot of existing applications that you used to wait overnight for. You'll get that data instantaneously, and then there'll be a host of new applications.","But how revolutionary that will be, I think this is going to happen, people will discover these new applications over a fairly long period of time. So as excited as we are about in-memory databases and we have by far the fastest in-memory database in the world. But again, the first benefit is to make the existing apps run much faster. The second benefit, \u2013 and that will happen right away. The second benefit will trickle in over the years as smart people discover new ways to build applications they never thought, that just weren't possible before the in-memory database.","Richard Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you.","Kenneth Bond - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","S. Kirk Materne - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks very much. Mark, just two quick questions. First, I wanted to follow up on your earlier comments regarding the customer experience pillar. Specifically, can you talk about your position today versus 12 months ago in terms of your visibility with actually with the Chief Marketing Officers? Obviously you guys have extremely strong relationships with CIOs, but I'm wondering how your relationships on the marketing side and with the CMOs has changed over the last 12 months.","And then secondarily, can you talk about just your industry solution trends and how they're doing and how important having some of that domain expertise is in terms of differentiating you all versus some of your competitors that don't have sort of that deep expertise in certain verticals? Thanks.","Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer","Sure. And marketing we've obviously made a significant investment between the acquisitions of Responsys and Eloqua respectively were the leader in B2C marketing and B2B marketing. We've added BlueKai. We've added Compendium. We just added a really nice company in Datalogix, and BlueKai and Datalogix with their data capabilities now differentiate us, just not on the marketing automation process and what you do with CMOs in automating that process, but also in the underpinning data sets that CMOs get access to. So we have become the biggest and the most popular in SaaS marketing, and that, frankly, to your point, Kirk, has caused us to now, as we've done with our sales forces, pointed our IE (38:32) sales force directly at a buyer. And that buyer is the CMO. Very similar to what we do in HR where we call in the head of HR, in marketing we call on the head of marketing.","And I think the best testimony to our success in our relationships are our numbers. Our growth in marketing in the quarter was over 200%, and when you look at our competitors, whether those be Adobe, the acquisition that Salesforce.com made, you just see that we are simply growing faster and we're taking market share in marketing SaaS.","So that's what I would describe in marketing. You had another question. Would you refresh me on what that was?","S. Kirk Materne - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker)","Oh, sure. Just your industry solutions, just how they are doing and how important that is in terms of differentiating yourselves versus competitors. Thanks.","Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and they had a \u2013 frankly, we've got so much going on in the company, we probably ought to talk about them more. They had a very good quarter in Q3, as they've had over the past several quarters. Obviously, our position in retail was extremely strategic to our customers, and we've now added MICROS, which brought with it a great depth in hospitality and food and beverage. So our retail suite of expertise is not just in general merchandising but across food and beverage and hospitality as well.","We had a very strong quarter in banking, and our expertise now in banking, we've grown our sales force, our ability now to help banks in compliance and anti-money laundering, many of the issues that our banking customers are facing today has become a tremendous asset for us. We've had a good quarter, and we continue to have good success in communications.","And without going through each one of them, they do give us strong differentiation because when we sell in these industries, we're talking to business buyers. We're talking to retailers, we're talking CEOs, we're talking to head of merchandising, and I think next week Larry and I will be at our conference, our Industry Connect conference, and we'll have roughly 2,000 of our customers there, and they will be business buyers. They will not be what you would think of as typically CIOs. They will be people on the business side and it gives us a reach into our customers that frankly we wouldn't have without the investment we've made in our GBUs.","Kenneth Bond - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please?","Operator","And our final question today will come from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Ross, your line is open.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Can you hear me now?","Operator","Yes. Go ahead, sir.","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Mark, I had two quick questions. We've seen two quarters in a row of hardware growth in constant currency and you mentioned double-digit growth in Engineered Systems, but I'm curious on the core M and T server lines and storage and what's happening there and your visibility into the entire hardware bucket growth being sustainable going forward. And then I'd love also your thoughts on large-company appetite to move core ERP to the cloud, especially as we think outside of North America in the international sphere. Thanks.","Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. To your point, Engineered Systems, I already went through it. It is now (42:00) a significant part of our hardware portfolio and grew 15%. M, while down, is a smaller piece of our hardware portfolio, being the M-Series of SPARC. T was down in the quarter, again, all offset by the growth we've seen in engineered systems. Storage grew in the quarter. We had significant, very strong growth in ZFS, if you will, our network attached storage product. That is not a new story, our ZFS growth, and I predict that will continue as we go forward.","We have just released a new SAN product, FS1, that came to us through the Pillar acquisition that our engineering team has done a super job for us, and that represents, really, a whole new storage market for us now to go compete head up against EMC. So I believe going forward you will see a continuation of storage growth, the continuation of ZFS along with now FS1, a continued growth in Engineered Systems and we'll continue to push refreshing our SPARC base as we have since we've got \u2013 as we go forward.","As it relates ERP, and you asked specifically about international markets, I mean, just for example in the quarter, just to give you some flavor for this, we closed ERP SaaS deals at FEMSA in Mexico at Saudi Telecom, at BAE Systems, at Hawaiian Airlines, at KPMG. I mean, these are all certainly very strong brands that are going ERP and ERP in Cloud, at least 75% of what I just named are outside the United States.","So we've had very strong \u2013 back to just sort of the Cloud context which probably is at the core of question, I think I said a couple of quarters ago, we're just going to get better and better at this. And while the numbers are faster than I predicted and I wish I could've predicted them better two or three quarters ago, our sales force has simply just gotten more productive. They're better educated, with better products, and they now have references in virtually every single discipline and pillar that we sell in almost every country that we sell.","And so what's happening is, it's very interesting, we're getting bigger and we're growing faster as we're getting bigger. And it's because of the multitude of these issues that I'm describing that have all now tilted our way after, frankly, 2, 2.5 years of hard work of getting our customers, similar to the last question, who now know their functional buyer. They know the head \u2013 the Chief Marketing Officer. They know the Chief Human Resource Officer. Our products have now gotten extremely mature and we've got references, and I think now that we add PaaS to our cloud offerings and I probably should've said this earlier, but I've been doing this a long time, and I've really never seen a pipeline grow as fast as our PaaS pipeline has grown.","We've really released this at Oracle OpenWorld in October, and the speed of our pipeline growth, you see it just in the conversion to bookings. I actually, Safra and I get to see it in the benefit of the pipeline and it is just exciting times for Oracle.","Back to Ken.","Kenneth Bond - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Mark.","A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call and we look forward to speaking with you.

Please go ahead, sir.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s second quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which include a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.","As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. And these forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today.","As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with few prepared remarks.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for the quarter, I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q3, as well as give some direction on FY17 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.","Clearly, we are pleased with our results as both total revenue and earnings per share exceeded the midpoint of my guidance. Our pivot to the cloud has been phenomenal. We continue to see accelerating growth rates in our cloud business, while our key competitors are slowing down, but more importantly, the increase in revenue from our cloud business is starting to overtake our new software license business decline. Our cloud revenue will be larger than our new software license revenue next fiscal year, when the transition will be largely complete. While the investments we\u2019ve made to transition our business to the cloud have limited our ability to expand earnings per share near-term, they\u2019ve been important to ensure that Oracle remains the technology leader. With cloud overtaking new software license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the previous decade as a license business, increasing revenue that results an EPS and cash flow that grow even faster.","We continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls, so that we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters, as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This quarter, the effects of currency movement were more than what I had included in my guidance, mostly because of the strengthening U.S. dollar after recent elections in U.S. and Europe, resulting in currency headwind of 1% in total revenue, 2% in some revenue categories and one penny to EPS. The devaluation of the Egyptian currency last month also negatively impacted EPS by a second penny. None of this was in my guidance for the quarter.","Cloud, SaaS, and PaaS revenues for the quarter were $912 million, up 89% from last year. You can also see the continuing acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $1.6 billion, up 51% in U.S. dollars; and SaaS and PaaS billings grew 39% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We\u2019ve put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail as usual.","When you add together cloud, SaaS and PaaS revenues, and new software license revenue, they grew 5% in constant currency. And by the way, Database as a Service and database new software license revenue together also grew. These are significant milestones in our transformation with the combination of our cloud and new software license businesses added together are growing.","As cloud becomes an even larger percentage of the total, the growth will only accelerate with earnings and cash flow following along. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. Q2 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 61%, up from 43% last year, and I expect to see further improvement in Q3 and Q4. And from there, we\u2019ll be targeting 80%.","Cloud infrastructure as a service revenue was $175 million, up 9% from last year. The Q2 gross margin was 37%. Now, that\u2019s lower than prior quarters as we are making the necessary investments to scale out this business. Now, I want to spend a moment explaining it to you, because you\u2019re going to see some effects.","What\u2019s happening with the infrastructure as a service gross margin is similar to what we experienced with the SaaS and PaaS gross margin, except that it\u2019s off a much smaller revenue base and thus the margin impact is more at the beginning.","To refresh for everyone, when we invested in our SaaS, PaaS business in advance of the revenue scale out, the gross margin declined 16 percentage points before bottoming at 40%; it\u2019s now up to 61%. And as I just mentioned, will climb to 80% over time. Similarly, I expect the infrastructure as a service gross margin will decline future over the next few quarters, as we make investments in the business to hit our expenses immediately while the revenue is recognized over time. But for modeling purposes, I would use 20% as a trough gross margin. Probably, it doesn\u2019t need to go quite that low but just for modeling purposes you can aim there, after which I expect the gross margin will climb to nearly 40% as the business scales probably higher.","Total cloud revenue in the quarter was over $1 billion for the first time at nearly $1.1 billion, up 69% in constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.1 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year.","Attach and renewal rates remained at their usual high levels, as our installed base of customers continues to grow. New software license revenues were slightly over $1.3 billion; now that is down 19%, reflecting the continued emphasis on and migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support was down 9% with hardware systems product revenue of $497 million and hardware support revenue of $517 million.","Just so that you know, we are proactively evaluating our expense infrastructure needed to support the on-premise hardware business in light of on-premise hardware revenue declines and the new availability of IaaS for their customers. For the Company total revenues for the quarter were $9.1 billion, up 2% from last year.","Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 3% from last year and operating margin was 42%, up from 41% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.5% considerably higher than last year\u2019s 20.4%, which had been favorably impacted by some onetime benefits. ","Now, in view of possible changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, normalization of our geographic earnings and other factors, the likelihood effect favorable impact to our tax rate over time is higher but obviously not certain. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.61 in U.S. dollars, the GAAP tax rate was 24.3%, the GAAP EPS was $0.48 in U.S. dollars.","Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.2 billion. Capital expenditures for Q2 was $757 million with cloud CapEx accounting for approximately 40% of the total with the rest being real estate. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.6 billion, up 10% from last year. We now have approximately $68 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $4 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency. This quarter, we purchased nearly 30 million shares for a total of $500 million, which is less than prior quarter, due obviously to the use of our cash for the acquisition of NetSuite. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve repurchased 172 million shares for a total of $6.7 billion and we paid out dividends of $2.5 billion. And the Board of Directors again declared A quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.","Now to the guidance. I am going to provide guidance for Q3, then some updated comments about the whole year.","Given recent currency movement, we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates and significant currency headwind. Today again was a very significant day in currency with the dollar strengthening. I am going to give you constant currency guidance, but if current exchange rates remain just about where they are right now, we expect to see a currency headwind of at least 1% on revenue and at least $0.01 to EPS. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis. With that my guidance is as follows.","SaaS and PaaS revenues including NetSuite is expected to grow 82% to 86%. Software and cloud revenue including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support is expected to grow 4% to 6%. Total revenue is expected to grow 3% to 5%. EPS is expected to be between $0.61 and $0.64 in constant currency. Now, this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%, which is considerably higher than the 22.6% reported last year. As a remainder, last year's tax rate was lower, mostly due to the catch-up of benefits related to the U.S. R&D tax credit. Of course, the Q3 tax rate could end up being different.","Over the full year FY17, I am raising the outlook for FY17 SaaS and PaaS revenue growth from 67% to 80% with NetSuite now added and continued strengthening in our SaaS and PaaS business. I continue to expect SaaS and PaaS gross margins will exit Q4 higher than the 61% reported today as our cloud business continues to grow dramatically. Lastly, I expect our total CapEx spend for the year will be in the range of about $2 billion with over half of it being due to non-cloud real estate investments that we made this year that we'll not be repeating next year.","With that I'll turn it over to Larry -- to Mark for his comments.","Mark Hurd","Thank you. As usual, I'm just going to you a lot [ph] of numbers here and try to give you some context on our quarter. Everything's year-on-year in CD, unless I say otherwise.","Cloud bookings for the quarter $377 million in USD. And Q2 was the best non-Q4 we have ever had. I'll make a prediction that Q3 has a chance to be our best ever quarter period. SaaS bookings were 270 in USD and positive to structure booking were 160 in USD.","Just let me give you some numbers by pillar as it relates to our SaaS, PaaS revenue. We were up 89%, more than 30% higher than Amazon, Salesforce or Workday. ERP had a 104% growth quarter-on-quarter, eighth consecutive quarter with sequential growth greater than 50%. HCM grew 131% again this quarter, that's four time the growth rate of Workday. CX, Customer Experience grew 15% organically, service was up 24%. Data as a Service up 71%. Database as a Service up 700% and already had a $100 million in quarterly revenue. PaaS was up 600% and overall SaaS, PaaS grew 89%. Saas, PaaS billings grew 39% in USD, Saas, PaaS deferred revenue 51% USD.","Now, just some customer metrics. IDC recently released their SaaS market share estimate. And Oracle is now the number one market share leader in Enterprise SaaS. In the quarter, we got almost 1,100 new SaaS customers and 1,082 to be exact, and have 810 expansions. In CX, we had 443 new customers, 517 expansions. In HCM, we had 224 new customers and 212 expansions. In ERP, we had 532 new customers and that does not include NetSuite; we had 91 expansions. Over half of the new ERP customers never had an Oracle app before they bought. Our active base now is 3,269 with 1,275 live, over 10X greater than Workday. In total, we now have almost 13,000 customers in our SaaS active base and 25,000 if you actually include NetSuite.","Fusion Cloud is now nearly two thirds of our new customer wins. This is a big deal for us because with 10 years actually writing this code and is now the bulk of our SaaS business. 348 go-lives, best quarter ever, 2,116 customers are now live on Fusion. We got 2,225 new platform customers in the quarter and our install base now sits at 12,168. We got 2,148 infrastructure customers; they are buying standalone infrastructure services. And together our install base of PaaS and infrastructure now sits at 21,219 customers. Now, as a point of clarification, PaaS and infrastructure customers are accounted for each service that they use.","Now, let me just give you the names of a few customers in the quarter. I'm going to go through just couple pillars. First in ERP, I'm giving you a list of ERP customers who purchased in the quarter: Canon, Deutsche Telekom, DICK'S Sporting Goods, FedEx, Ferguson, Hasbro, Hill-Rom, Koch Industries, Noble Energy, Ricoh, Skanska, Texas Instruments.","I\u2019m going to give you a list of HCM customers in the quarter. Berkshire Hathaway, Cummins, Dubai Airport, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Netgear, ON Semiconductor, Siemens, Skanska, Sonic Automotive, Tesco, Hertz Corporation. It was a solid quarter for us.","And lastly, let me sort of describe where I think we are. We not only have strong revenue and billings as well, but our Q2 billings were solid at 39%; Q3 has a chance to be our best quarter ever. Q2 revenue was fantastic at 89% and we clearly crossed the revenue gap. We are clearly the fastest growing cloud company with scale.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry.","Larry Ellison","Thank you, Mark. Historically, I\u2019d measured Oracle performance by comparing our technology and our market share to our two primary competitors, SAP and application, and IBM and infrastructure and database. That changes as we move to the cloud. In the cloud, we measure Oracle against salesforce.com and application, and Amazon Web Services and infrastructure and database.","Our cloud applications\u2019 goal is to be the world largest and most profitable SaaS Company. We are growing our cloud business much faster than salesforce.com and we can beat them to the $10 billion mark, but it\u2019s going to be close. IDC already recognizes Oracle as the number one in annual SaaS sales to large enterprise; salesforce.com is number two. We will book more than $2 billion in annual cloud sales this year, much more than salesforce.com. We are catching after them and we\u2019re catching them very quickly. Our goal in infrastructure and database is to be number one running database workloads in the cloud on our infrastructure as a service.","The Oracle database has a huge technical and market share lead over the Amazon Web Services databases Azure and Redshift. But much more importantly, the Oracle cloud infrastructure as a service runs the oracle database workloads much faster, more reliantly and at a significantly lower cost than the Oracle database running at Amazon IaaS.","We are making a multiyear generational shift to the cloud and we\u2019re well on our way to being number one in both cloud application and cloud database, and we are doing it with very little or no compromise to our earnings or our cash flow.","With that, I\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies.","John DiFucci","Thank you. My question is to Mark. Mark, our field check this quarter led us to believe that cloud traction accelerated beyond what you had been doing which was pretty good, very good. And we thought this might have a negative effect on license, which sort of comes through in the increased decline in license. But with ARR growth of 30%, that doesn\u2019t seem to be indicative of increasing cloud traction. Can you help us resolve this? I mean, what we\u2019re hearing in the field and the numbers, what the numbers seem to indicate, is it simple as 30% ARR growth may not be the 42% last year, but it\u2019s still pretty good off such a large number or there something else going on?","Mark Hurd","All right. Let me go into figures and the math to start with. Our pipeline is really big, our wins are pretty big or quite big as well. As I mentioned in my script and I may have gone over it too fast, we had a good quarter in ARR. So, these are the days when 30% growth -- gee, I wish it was higher, I like 30% growth. That said, we can do a lot better and what I said about Q3. So Q2, just to go back to that number is the best non-Q4 we have ever had in terms of bookings.","I think there is a chance, and I\u2019ll repeat it again, Q3 is the best quarter we\u2019ve ever had -- we could ever have period. That\u2019s how good I feel about our pipeline, how good I feel about our position, deals that -- I don\u2019t usually talk about deals we\u2019ve won in early Q3, but that\u2019s how strong our position is going into quarter. And my guess, John, is that\u2019s why you hear what you hear from your field check, the deals we won. We may not have contracted it, put on a piece of paper, but we feel really strong about our position. Larry talked about the $2 billion for the full year. So that would be my response, John.","John DiFucci","And if I could, just to be clear, when you\u2019re talking right now, you\u2019re talking like there is a lot of terms, like ARR billings, bookings. And I\u2019m going to stick with your ARR number, because that\u2019s what you guys used when you first started talking about this. When you\u2019re talking about this could be the best quarter ever, you\u2019re talking about when you\u2019ve traditionally called the ARR, which is new annual recurring revenue?","Mark Hurd","Yes, John, and you\u2019re right. We are passing a lot of different numbers to you. I think we\u2019re trying to be very transparent with all the deferred numbers and the billings and so forth. But the comment I may directly related to new and expansion ARR focus. And that is in the end a very good surrogate for how we will perform. So, I think the big number though back to it is the full year that we described. And so you may see some things in the quarter that go up or down, but the full year $2 billion number is where we sit.","John DiFucci","Great. That is very clear, very helpful. Thanks.","Mark Hurd","Thank you, John.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you. Can you provide us more details and insight into NetSuite, its impact on Q2 revenue, margins et cetera and its impact on quarter? I really appreciate. Thanks.","Safra Catz","Well, we got NetSuite in Q2 about, as I said -- I thought I said it; I didn\u2019t mention, around November 7. So, we didn\u2019t even have a full month. So it\u2019s around 50 million. It\u2019s basically a wash on all the other lines, as you know since we just got it. It\u2019s revenue track is very similar to what it\u2019s been doing, however if you know Net Suite doesn\u2019t grow as fast as our cloud business grows, nor is it as profitable. So overtime we\u2019re going to bring it to where we\u2019re doing and we also hope to accelerate it actually, because our productline is so much broader including the EPM and things like that.","So this quarter I could refer to it as a wash, and as we own it overtime, we expect to be able to leverage it and -- but it doesn\u2019t grow obviously as fast as our ERP business does. ","Kash Rangan","Thanks, and if you could give us over time a little more color on that that would be great, I really appreciate it. Thank you.","Safra Catz","Okay, I will.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss ","You mentioned during the conference call that database and Databases as service together grew again, I think this is second quarter you\u2019ve made that comment. What one of the questions that I get a lot from client and I wanted to ask of you is, are we seeing the positive impacts of the 12C cycle? Is that already showing up in terms of options driving that number higher on the license side in, is Database as service offering -- the new 12C offering driving people to that cloud offering as well or is it still really early days in terms of that cycle and this is just core database growth if you will?","Mark Hurd","It\u2019s really early days, and actually 12.2 is only available right now in our cloud in Database as a service, so it really isn\u2019t available on premises yet. So our policy is cloud first and including the release of our latest technologies. So again we\u2019re very, very early on in terms of the 12.2 cycle and it\u2019s impacting our database license system.","Safra Catz","So really all of you are seeing just the strength of our database business. A very, very strong business generally because it is by far the best and we\u2019ve been gaining market share now really for years and that just continues because it meets the needs of so many customers. ","Keith Weiss ","Got it. And if I may, just one follow up. Albeit early days, you gave us an update awhile ago on the options, and talking about some of these options being [indiscernible] as well as adopted options that you've received. Has that trend continued or do you continue to see strong adoption of some of those new options on 12C?","Ken Bond","I think people, I guess people using these options in the cloud, I think they are very excited about using the both in the cloud and on-premises and I think it\u2019s going to have a positive impact of it, a very significant impact on both our database as a service and our [on-term] license business.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan ","One question for Safra and one for Mark that\u2019s okay, question for you Safra, with respect to your cloud centers, one of the things we keep looking for is gross profit growth rate and you\u2019ve been able to show that two quarters in a row [ph], I think for the first time we also saw op income growth rate. Are you still confident that on organic basis that you can continue to accelerate op income growth rate and if so, what will contribute to that and one quick one for Mark if I could, did you comment on what the accelerated buying experience program mean for the company\u2019s growth rate future?","Safra Catz","Okay well obviously, I think what you\u2019re starting to see, we\u2019ve got a bunch of things going on, they\u2019re all positive. We have revenue growth, we have operating income growth and I think you\u2019re going to see that actually accelerate.","So as SaaS, and PaaS really takeoff this is going to show up and as I mentioned -- and as I want to make sure I reiterate from Financial Analyst Day once again, we are expecting double earnings growth in FY'18. So this is -- you\u2019ll hear me say that many times and we are starting to see the upturn.","Larry Ellison","Kash, you didn\u2019t ask me a question, I was the only one [multiple speakers].","Mark Hurd","I'm going to try and just say, there is huge economy to scale in this business. So as we scale that\u2019s it's still important that we become number one in SaaS. There is just tremendous advantages of being number one, there is huge economies of scale. It contributes enormous to our profitability in the business both in SaaS, and being number one in data base in the cloud.","To your other questions, accelerated buying experience continues to progress. We launched it really less than the year ago, this is our third quarter really doing it. We\u2019ve got about now 70% of our transactions, not necessarily our dollar volume going through. And our customers are just to be very frank, is very well received and is happier. It's just easier to do business and to get a contract with Oracle now than it\u2019s ever been and it's great when customers are happier.","Our next target is really to focus around our overall experience in the cloud after the purchase. So ABE or Accelerated Buying Experience is really focused on the actual purchase and the contract. Our focus now is really after that contract and between the contracts signing and the renewal. And to that end on December 1, I announced a group inside Oracle, called the Oracle cloud global service and support group. And it really pulls together all the various organizations around the company that had touched our cloud customers and brings them together into an organizational unit, focused slowly on pleasing and delighting our customers and giving them the absolute best customer experience they can possibly ask for.","We want to become and define what the best cloud experience is in the industry for our customers. So think of that as the follow one to be accelerated buying experience that we\u2019ve announced effective December 1.","Operator","And now our next question will come from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Market.","Ross MacMillan","I had one for Safra then maybe one related for Larry. When you think about CapEx this year guided to 2 billion, a bit less than half on cloud. So that billion run rate, is that the right level of CapEx that we should be thinking about even beyond this year or will it grow as the total cloud grows?","And then related to that for Larry, is infrastructure as a service a necessity as opposed to platform as a service? If you are going to be able to migrate existing on-prem database workloads to the cloud? Thanks.","Safra Catz","So two things were happening as we grow in both IAS and PaaS, you do get, first an investment period and then you really have economies of scale which we should see. So it will not grow linearly at all. So it will grow as depending on how successful we are, but it's growing up front then it's going to slow down, get used and then grow as a smaller and smaller percentage. And that's what we are expecting as far as our capital expenditure this year we\u2019re obviously very much front loaded, both some of our cloud investment and also our real estate investments, which will not be sort of the big chunk it is right -- as it was this year.","Larry Ellison","And the question about infrastructure as a service, is it effectual, the answer is yes, if you want to move existing database workloads to the cloud and minimize the changes customers have to make as they migrate, in other words, make it a graceful easy lift and shift. We can configure our cloud network from that spare network, we can configure other servers to match their capacity -- the capacity of their servers, configure storage, deliver exit data and service, do all of that with virtually no disruption to what they're doing.","As they press the button, move their database, move their workloads and it just runs pretty much like the way it ran. They don't have to re-task the application. They can just move it and it will just launch. Then we absolutely need an infrastructure as a service in combination with our platform as a service, we need both of them to do that gracefully. So it is an essential, we've been in this infrastructure as a business technology development phase for a long time.","We're rolling it out to our customers again early in days, but it's being very-very well received, of course the litmus test is, can we do it better than Amazon could, could our infrastructure -- big question, can Oracles' infrastructure as a service differentiate itself from Amazon. Can we do it more gracefully, more reliably, less expensively, more securely than Amazon can, and we think we can, and that's going to make us very-very competitive.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindland with Macquarie.","Sarah Hindland","Great, thank you so much for taking my question. Safra this one\u2019s really for you, so one of the big things we get asked about and would love some help on is as more and more customers are pivoting to Oracle cloud, it still maintains its very high renewal rate on the maintenance stream and I'd love to know a little bit more about how we should be thinking about the maintenance, stuff that you can support longer time and the trajectory on that line? Even as new licenses are declining you're still selling licenses, so how should we be thinking about that longer time Safra?","And then a real quick second one for Mark around the hardware business, and we didn't spend a whole lot of time on that today I would also love to hear how you're thinking about that business longer term as well. Thank you guys.","Safra Catz","Okay, so you're right in that our renewal rates remain very high, however as you know we don't renew a 100% of our licensed updates and product support and as the new software license number gets smaller and smaller, it is true that at one point software support will flatten out and actually go down. That's a ways out so far and we actually don't have any indication of that because we continue to sell quite a lot of new software licenses.","However ultimately we would be -- it would be -- I know it\u2019s hard to imagine a good outcome, but it will mean that we're getting extremely not large number in our SaaS, PaaS number, one that actually is dwarfing not only new software license, but new software license and any kind of decline in the software support network, such that the whole software network which is SaaS, PaaS, new software license and support is all going up and actually accelerating.","Mark Hurd","Before, I going to hardware business, our renewal rates in software for the quarter, we usually just tell you they are about the same. To be very exact, they actually went up. So our cancelation rates were down in the quarter. So we have a very strong renewal rate in our software business. Now that said, we are actually, in many cases trying to convert our customers to cloud. So just to be clear, that means for us more money, that means for us more margin.","So it is clearly our objective over time is to take the applications business to migrate our on-prem application customers to our cloud applications. I already mentioned our database customers on-prem to our infrastructure and platform. And we believe as you all very well, most of you at least very well know the math. That means for us a larger recurring revenue stream and as our margins continue decline, that means more earnings for us and we think a great experience for us customers, as well.","Hardware really more of what we talked about, sort of the reason we haven\u2019t talked about it much, we had a very good engineered systems quarter again. Engineering systems grew and in both bookings and revenue in the quarter that ecosystem continues to be very successful, very profitable for us. There is a great job for us, we had declines and what we think of as our traditional server business and those declines offset the growth in engineered systems. So it's really the tale of two product lines, engineered systems growing, the traditional server product lines, declining.","Now this is a last quarter, this being Q2 that you will see the declines because of the acquired GBU products. So we brought the couple of micros, for example a couple of years ago, a year-and-a-half ago, it had a bunch of third party products that we actually stopped and that\u2019s actually hurt the growth rate of the hardware line, that begins to -- and as we go Q3.","So those are sort of the three factors the third party products in our micros business, growth in engineered systems and decline in the traditional servers.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.","Michael Turits","This is a question that\u2019s mostly for Safra and for Mark. New software licenses declined 19% constant currency. Does this mean that license declines could continue to steepen going forward and maybe I\u2019ll answer the second part of my question at the same time, which is database as a business overall grew. So if you could talk to us about how database license did within license overall.","Safra Catz","So let me at least get started with that. No, I actually I\u2019m not expecting next quarter for it to decline, even at the 19% range because the big decline has been in the application side as SaaS had really overtaken our app business. And as apps has gotten starting smaller, the base itself is not decline -- is small, that when it declines it has a smaller impact on our overall new software license.","Now ultimately at one point, you\u2019ll see the same happening in database, but the reality is, you\u2019re not seeing it in database at this time, because our installed base of usage continues to increase at all level on-premise and in the cloud simultaneously.","Larry Ellison","Once again, there will have to be an interruption, but I'll use this as a great opportunity to answer it anyway. So let me be clear. So if you convert, if you move from the Oracle business suite on-premise and then you take up Fusion ERP in the cloud and we encourage you to do that, right, and we want you to do that. You cancel your support for the Oracle ERP on-premise, what we call the e-business suite and you\u2019re start paying as a monthly fees for Fusion. So even support, not only does new license go down, but even support go down as you make the shift and we want you to do because we make a lot more money in that way. ","However in database, if you bring database to infrastructure as a service, you need to own the database license, you never cancel your database license and support. That goes on forever. So as people migrate let\u2019s say you take the Oracle database to Oracle infrastructure as a service, you still your support and if you need more, you but more -- license more database. Let\u2019s say you take the Oracle database to Amazon. Well, you need your Oracle database and we need more of it, you got to buy of it and license more of it and you have to keep paying support.","So they are very different businesses, their profile is vary very differently. So as Safra said, a lot of license decline is attributable to our applications business which is getting -- with the on-prem application business is getting smaller and smaller. The database business, license business looks as growing. So this are very -- these will reach -- both these businesses will react very differently in the cloud.","It\u2019s not an unlikely outcome that our database license system goes on forever and the associated support goes on forever even though customers are running that database now not on their own computers, but on our infrastructures as a service or Amazon\u2019s infrastructures as a service, or Azure\u2019s infrastructure as a service. So you have to model these two businesses entirely differently.","Michael Turits","Thanks Larry, didn\u2019t mean to leave you out.","Larry Ellison","I know you get -- I know I\u2019m getting old. And this is complicated stuff and I realize you don\u2019t want to wear me out during the call. So I appreciate your consideration.","Operator","And our final question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow","Thanks for taking my question. And it's great to see your CTO so busy on the call. My question is actually for Mark. Mark, can you talk a little bit about what you see in the different regions? You talked about the products, but just wanted to hear how you see the regional performance. If I look at the numbers, Asia was very strong, U.S. and Europe moderated a little bit. Can you just talk what you see in terms of end amount there? And then Safra, did I understand, did I hear you correctly that you talked about double-digit EPS growth in 2018? Just wanted to clarify that.","Mark Hurd","Okay, by the way just to be clear to the CTO\u2019s earlier point, as it relates to apps and applications business, we actually don\u2019t compensate our sales people for applications on-premise, so just to be clear to connect these dots in terms of how we actually operationalized the company. Our sales people in the applications ecosystems sell FAS. So if they sell -- we have small swat teams in our, what we would call Oracle direct organization, that help our existing users by incremental seats if they need to, to their existing on-premise applications. So I only say that to you because, all of this is planful on our part, our objective is to move to SaaS to get as clear about our direction in SaaS and its resulted in this leadership position enterprise SaaS that we discussed that earlier. So this is all very planful on our part.","So your question about the regions. All of our regions, the region that had the toughest turn in the quarter was Latin America, and Latin America has been historically and still is one of our best regions in terms of our performance of our team, et cetera, but they are going through all of the things that you all know about, in Brazil, some of the issues that have cropped up now in Mexico.","But now at the same time as Latin America has had a little bit of tough cards, they are gaining significant market share in that market. So I -- while the numbers of Latin America are perhaps not as good as we all would love, or have been in the past, their relative performance compared to their peers is fantastic. So I am actually very proud of them in spite affected the absolute dollar value to state.","Save that, our Europe and North America region performed roughly as I would have expected, I continue to believe our European organization has done a tremendous job over the past several years, they in addition have done tremendous rule over to the cloud. Their absolute bookings on an overall basis just taking license and cloud combined grew, so very significant. I\u2019m pleased with North America as well, they were roughly as we expected.","On the flip side, I would say Asia has been superb. I think Asia has done a nice turn around. It wasn\u2019t a couple years ago, we have been in call and get questioned about some of the performance in Asia, we weren\u2019t very happy with that, we made some changes and the performance in Asia on virtually every metric we see, talking about hardware, SaaS PaaS, infrastructure and license, has been very favorable. So I'm very pleased with the results in Asia.","Safra Catz","Yes sir, I wanted to just make sure, you did hear me right we are expecting to have double digit earnings growth next year.","Raimo Lenschow","I am looking forward to that.","Safra Catz","Okay.","Ken Bond","Okay. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours, dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the investor relations department for any follow-up questions from this call. And we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today. And with that I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for closing. Happy Holidays.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's Oracle's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

","Now I\u2019d like to turn today\u2019s conference over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.","On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.","As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today.","As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors. And other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.","As a reminder and consistent with prior calls, Safra\u2019s and Mark\u2019s comments today will use constant dollar growth rates unless stated otherwise so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarter as well, as to reflect how we actually measure the business.","And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revisit our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q3 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.","As you can see, we had another excellent quarter. Customer adoption of our Cloud products and services continues to be very strong and what we have called our on-premise business remains robust. Bottom line, our transition to the Cloud is going well. Despite the currency benefit being less than my guidance, total revenue was more than the high end of my guidance range and earnings per share was at the high-end even at a higher tax rate than expected.","Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 47% from last year. Fusion Cloud revenue was up 56% for the quarter. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter was $398 million, up 20% from last year. But just as a reminder, part of the Cloud PaaS and IaaS business is our legacy hosting services which don\u2019t share the same high growth characteristics as PaaS and next-gen IaaS services.","This portion of PaaS\/IaaS saw growth of 46% in CD and 49% in USD, while the traditional hosting services, which we are de-focusing, were down nearly 10%. As traditional hosting services become a smaller part of total PaaS and IaaS, the underlying growth of PaaS and next-gen IaaS will be more visible.","I want to also take a moment to review the announcements we made in October of bring your own licenses, what we call BYOL and autonomous database. Unlike the applications business where customers move to SaaS subscriptions, stop buying upfront licenses and shelve application support, BYOL customers can leverage their years of investment in Oracle database and technology software and bring those licenses to the Oracle cloud infrastructure instead of cancelling their licenses and support and moving to rent new licenses.","With BYOL, we are seeing a strong increase in our technology installed base as customers renew their unlimited license agreement, invest in more licenses and options and renew support. Because BYOL is now available and customers better understand their transition options to move to the Oracle Cloud, technology new software license revenue is dramatically improving from the declines we were seeing previously. We expect this trend to continue as we roll out Autonomous Database as customers license the options and technology they need. We expect to continue to take share in database.","Now, total cloud and software revenues were $7.8 billion, up 7% in constant currency and up 9% in U.S. dollars. In fact, we\u2019ve consistently overachieved our software and cloud revenue forecast the last seven quarters. I focus on these numbers, which we refer to as the ecosystem revenues, because that is where all of our software assets come together and you can start to see the powerful dynamics of the business, especially with our BYOL model.","Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 39% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.3 billion, up 1% from last year, reflecting stable software license and continued high attach of software support and renewal rates that reflect the stability of our installed base of customers.","GAAP application total revenues which is new licenses and support and SaaS, were $2.7 billion, up 13% and GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenues, which includes new license and support and PaaS and IaaS, were $5.1 billion, up 4%. As for cloud margins, our SaaS business continues to scale and grow and the gross margin has expanded to 66% up from 59% last Q2.","We expect to see further improvement in FY 2018 and we remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins. The gross margin of PaaS and IaaS was 40%, down from 44% last quarter as our geographic buildout goes forward in response to demand but ahead of the bulk of new revenue recognition. When we are at scale, I expect to see major improvement in PaaS and IaaS gross margin. Hardware revenues were $940 million, down 9%, and service revenues were $856 million, essentially unchanged in constant currency.","Total non-GAAP revenue for the company were $9.6 billion, up 4% from last year and 6% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 8% from last year, 10% in U.S. dollars. The operating margin was 44%, which was up from 42% last year. The operating margins have now increased year over year for five consecutive quarters and while I can\u2019t promise this will happen every quarter, I do expect that operating margins will continue to expand.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was slightly higher than expected at 25.2%. As a result, EPS was $0.01 less at $0.70 a share in U.S. dollars, up 14% in U.S. dollars, 12% in CD. The GAAP tax rate was 22.1% and GAAP EPS was $0.52.","Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.6 billion, up 2%, and free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.5 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $599 million. I expect the cloud CapEx spending would be driven by our ARR growth and the PaaS\/IaaS buildout that I mentioned earlier. Obviously, should we see higher than expected ARR growth, we\u2019d expect to see higher CapEx investments as well.","Now we have more than $71 billion in cash and marketable securities but net of debt our cash position is $10.9 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, up 6% in constant currency. This quarter we repurchased nearly 41 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months we\u2019ve repurchased 74.5 million shares for a total of $3.5 billion. We also paid out dividends of nearly $3 billion. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by $12 billion and again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.","Now to the guidance for Q3. My guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. However, there has been some currency movement and assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue or $0.03 positive on EPS. So, for Q3 in constant currency, Cloud revenue including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS are expected to grow 21% to 25%.","Total revenues is expected to range from 2% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.68 and $0.70. That puts the USD earnings per share at $0.71, and $0.73. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate somewhere around 24%. Of course with the current and very real possibility of tax reform, the Q3 tax rate could easily end up being very different especially to the extent that there is repatriation.","With that, I will turn over to Mark for his comments.","Mark Hurd","Thanks, Safra.","Really, a solid quarter for Oracle from top to bottom. Just a few numbers. USD revenue was up 6%. Software and Cloud revenue was up 9%. Operating income was up 10%. Net income was up 16%. EPS grew 14%. That\u2019s three quarters in a row where EPS growth has been over double digits.","Safra\u2019s point about our apps ecosystem, our application revenue was up 13%. That is a GAAP CD number. We\u2019re growing roughly three times as fast as the market. I\u2019ve seen market numbers of two, three, three-and-a-half, so depending on how you look at those numbers we\u2019re more than three times as fast as the market, maybe for with nearly 90% of that revenue being recurring on a trailing 12-month basis.","SaaS bookings was a strong quarter for us. We grew 42% in USD. That 42% accelerated meaning the growth rate was higher that prior year. PaaS revenue was up 47% and over $4.5 billion annualized run rate. ERP was up 66% organically. Overall ERP is now at $1.4 billion annual run rate.","Fusion HCM up 77%, more than double the growth rate of Workday. CX double-digit growth with CX now at $1.1 billion annualized run rate. Data-as-a-Service, up 47%. Our verticals were up 19%. That\u2019s on a compare of last year\u2019s growth of 125%. Our technology ecosystem that\u2019s on-premise license, on-premise support and our PaaS and infrastructure revenue altogether was up 4% with solid cloud growth and new software license which was essentially flat in the quarter.","In terms of our platform and infrastructure revenue that was up 20%. Now there are couple of things to call out here. As was mentioned first inside our PaaS and infrastructure is the legacy hosting business which is declining. Second, we have Oracle Cloud Machine revenue which is not yet reported, which we discussed last quarter. If you put it altogether the 49% growth Safra mentioned earlier, if all that Oracle cloud machine had been provisioned our revenue growth rate would\u2019ve been above 55% in USD.","Business analytics was up 104%, data integration up 88%, storage and compute infrastructure as a service both up triple digits. Cloud revenue grew 41% in USD now over a $6 billion run rate and 80% of that trailing 12 months software and cloud revenue is now recurring. Our cloud deferred revenue was up 33%.","Not just closing looking forward we\u2019re executing well on a big and our pipeline is the biggest we\u2019ve ever had and we expect to sell around $2 billion in SaaS ARR over the next four quarters, that being the second half of 2018 and the first half of fiscal 2019. Lastly, this was again another solid quarter from top line growth of 6% USD all the way down to the bottom at 14% EPS growth.","I\u2019m going to give you a few customer names, wins, we had in the quarter and I\u2019ll just try to run through these quickly. But I think it\u2019s important for you to hear these brand names. In ERP cloud Adventist Health, AXA, Banco Santander, Pasha Bank, City of Las Vegas, Club Core, Emirates Airlines, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, John Hancock, Johnson Controls, Mattel, News Corp, Wessar Motor, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, The Bank of Nova Scotia, UCLA, Williams-Sonoma.","In HCM, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Association Generale, BioWare and Pharmaceuticals, Chicago Transit Authority, The City of Atlanta, Deutsche Post, Emblem Health, Emirates Air, Henry Ford Health Systems, Mars, Shell, Southwestern Energy Company, Treasury Wine Estate, Williams-Sonoma.","Just a couple on the infrastructure and platform side, Akamai, Alliance, Arconic, Baptist Healthcare System, City of Palm Beach, CVS, Los Angeles County, Orange, Softbank, Tellier, University of Durham, U.S. Census Bureau, Oil Fuel Services, Z\u00fcrich Insurance Group, a lot of logos. I could\u2019ve gone for a lot longer, but I just wanted to give you some context of the sorts of brands that are buying our cloud technologies.","With that, Larry\u2019s got some comments.","Larry Ellison","Thanks Mark.","This coming January, Oracle will deliver the world\u2019s first autonomous database. We expect this innovative new technology to dramatically accelerate the growth of our PaaS and SaaS businesses and keep our database license business strong as well.","People are buying database licenses to run on premise and in the cloud. You can run them either place. Their buying options to run on premise and in the cloud.","Based on machine learning, the new autonomous version of the Oracle database is totally automated, a self-driving system that does not require human beings to either manage or tune the database.","Using artificial intelligence to eliminate most sources of human error, the Oracle Autonomous Database delivers an unprecedented 99.995% system availability. That\u2019s less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year.","To achieve that level of reliability, the Oracle Autonomous Database automatically tunes and upgrades itself without human intervention. If a security vulnerability is detected, the database automatically and immediately detaches itself while the system is running. AWS databases can\u2019t do any of this.","Even more compelling is the cost comparison between running the Oracle autonomous database versus running an Amazon database like Redshift. In a series of published benchmark tests the Amazon Redshift database on average costs five times more to run the same exact amount of work as the Oracle Autonomous Database.","Let me repeat that. If you take a workload from Amazon running on Redshift and move it over to Oracle, your Amazon bill will drop by 80%. It will cost you five times more to run Redshift than to run the Oracle Autonomous. And this is not total cost of ownership, this is not labor, this is not - this is your Amazon bill, what you pay Amazon to do a piece of work, you can run on the Oracle cloud and pay $.20 on the dollar by moving from Amazon to Oracle.","We\u2019re so confident of our cost advantages over Amazon that Oracle will provide our customers with written service level agreements that guarantee, that guarantee moving to the Oracle cloud will cut Amazon customer\u2019s database bills in half or substantially more than half.","Ken Bond","Could we please go to Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler, Sanford Bernstein.","Mark Moerdler","Could you give us a better sense of what exactly is driving clients select between Oracle\u2019s private cloud, Oracle infrastructure service, Oracle PaaS, on-premise? Why is it taking longer right now [indiscernible] rollout? And then a quick follow-up question.","Larry Ellison","Why it\u2019s taking longer, to provision the Oracle cloud machine, it\u2019s the responsibility of Oracle to deliver the cloud machines and the cloud software and then the customers, then we have to actually install these cloud machines in the customer's data center and hook up to the customer\u2019s network.","And every customer is a little bit different. So it takes us a certain amount of time to configure the system on Oracle's side. But the big thing is now the customer has to get the appropriate networking gear and connect the Oracle cloud machine into their network. And that's what's proven to take longer than we had first anticipated.","So we have a bit of a backlog on that. But it\u2019s a matter of, again, easy for us to shift. Everyone receives the same cloud hardware. That\u2019s easy for us to do. Everyone receives the same cloud software. But connecting it in the customer data center can vary from data center to data center and that\u2019s what\u2019s taking the extra time.","Mark Hurd","Good news, Mark, is we sold a lot and we\u2019re in the process of implementing those as we speak and I tried to give them my comments that we would\u2019ve had a significant improvement in growth rate win if those had been provisioned and they\u2019ll get provisioned shortly. So it\u2019s been a very successful launch for us.","Mark Moerdler","Excellent, very helpful. As a quick follow up, what\u2019s the use cases for Oracle Cloud Machine versus infrastructure as a service, et cetera?","Mark Hurd","Well, listen, the good thing is it\u2019s sort of all of our technologies when you start it. So we have customers that use it for ERP, for HCM, and it really, Mark, fits more into markets where the industries we have regulatory issues. So if you get into banking and pharma, you have more of these security issues, I won\u2019t go through all of them in detail.","And so in many cases, it\u2019s easier for some of the big banks, some of the big Pharma companies and frankly, even in telecommunications where you see it\u2019s easier to get through those regs, we\u2019ll just take all the advantages of the cloud. So let me just go through this, Mark.","You get really all of the price advantages, you\u2019re buying variably. We do all of the work, we do all of the patching. The customer really doesn\u2019t touch this so they get the benefits of cloud on one hand while not having to deal with some of what the regulatory issues might be on the other hand.","The downside is what Larry went through. We have to actually physically go in and implement this and there\u2019s some extra work that might be done as opposed to just hooking up directly into our cloud. Does that help you?","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Mark, you mentioned in your comments that you\u2019re going to do $2 billion in new SaaS ARR over the next year. I was wondering if you could help us think about how this translates into SaaS revenue growth trend as we look out over the same time period? Thank you.","Mark Hurd","A couple of things. One, I was not trying to confuse what I thought this year\u2019s fiscal bookings in cloud would be with rolling four quarters, SaaS, ARR bookings would be. So those are two separate numbers and I\u2019m glad the way you worded it because I must\u2019ve said it right.","The $2 billion is a forward-looking next rolling four quarters of SaaS bookings and I think that\u2019s more than anybody is going to be even close to that sort of bookings number but obviously we\u2019ll see. So we think that\u2019s going to be very, very aggressive.","What is going to happen on the overall ecosystem? As you probably know, and I know I\u2019ve said before, most of what\u2019s in our revenue base today did not come from our on-prem user base. Most came from competitors or came from companies that really are in their first set of application, midmarket companies, fast growth companies, et cetera.","So what I think does happen is just to make sure you understand, I think we said it before, but Oracle actually goes live on cloud financials right at the turn of the calendar year. So our e-business suite base, which is not the predominant piece of our cloud SaaS base, will see this as a big, big move. So we are hopeful when you talk what the entire ecosystem that actually we\u2019ll start to see a higher degree of Oracle\u2019s user base moving.","And I want to emphasize again, that is a good thing. We get materially more revenue when a customer moves from support of their existing on-prem applications to now SaaS. And that is roughly three times or more ARR and the three times, I want to emphasize again, is the equivalent of a like-for-like support compared to their new applications in the cloud. So what do I expect to happen in the ecosystem? I think the ecosystem actually grows faster as a result of everything I described. Most of our base today did not come from the Oracle base.","The Oracle base now with more and more references to move certainly our latest releases which are now in release 13, more feature-rich than anything obviously we\u2019ve ever had before, Heather, and as that support base moves to cloud, we actually get more revenue and, as a result, the ecosystem grows faster.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse.","Brad Zelnick","I've got one for Mark and a quick follow up for Safra. Mark, Oracle has been maintaining share when we consider the entire database ecosystem, but we keep hearing competitors and surveys saying customers are moving off Oracle. Can you maybe share some firsthand customer perspectives and frame the value of what lives in Oracle database that isn\u2019t going anywhere versus the type of stuff we might be hearing about?","Larry Ellison","I\u2019d like to answer that. Let me tell you who\u2019s not moving off of Oracle. A company you\u2019ve heard of just give us another $50 million this quarter to buy Oracle database and other Oracle technology. That company is Amazon. They\u2019re not moving off of Oracle. Sales force isn\u2019t moving off of Oracle.","Our competitors who have no reason to like us very much continue to invest in and run their entire business on Oracle. I don\u2019t know whose moving off of Oracle. Maybe Mark does, maybe Safra does, but Amazon, you\u2019d think Amazon would really want to move. ","Let me tell you someone else who\u2019s not moving off of Oracle, SAP. They had that database called HANA they\u2019d like to move to. SuccessFactors, they\u2019ve been trying to move off of Oracle for five or six years. SAP is running on Oracle. Ariba runs an Oracle. All SAP large customers run on Oracle. Amazon continues to buy Oracle technology to run their business. Salesforce runs entirely on Oracle. Go ahead, you tell me who\u2019s moving off of Oracle.","Mark Hurd","Brad, thanks for the question. So a couple of points. Listen, I think when this comes up, I\u2019d like to just go back to the math and just go back to the numbers. We\u2019ve got sort of every other database being used just in shared terms is ours. And when you see us throwing up yet again another growth rate above market, it\u2019s just any of these sort of stories, anecdotes - by the way, I\u2019ve heard them for seven years, right? It predates me.","So, you know, everybody\u2019s moving off the Oracle database or what you think of this guy or that guy? And the latest guy, somebody told me, what do you think of \u2013 what\u2019s that company? MongoDB. I said the only thing I remember about MongoDB is three numbers: 100, 200, 100.","That\u2019s their revenue 100, 200 were their expenses, and 100 was their losses. And so I have that implanted in my brain and the $100 million as a part of $40 billion seems really small to me. I don\u2019t know. Maybe different, your math, your numerate as well.","So I just look at our numbers and I look at us growing faster than market and it\u2019s now been going on a while. By the way, an important thing to notice, I don\u2019t really care whether we denominate that in platforms of service or, if you will, databases of service, licenses, Larry went into one example of a license deal, and\/or database support. And I think when you look at that aggregated ecosystem, I guess with the stories, I just love somebody show up with something more than a story.","Just show up with a number and all we do is keep showing up every single quarter with math that says, okay, could be true but whether Larry is talking about what Redshift, I brought up this other guy. Just look at the list of competitors out there and I just don\u2019t see growth rates that certainly nobody gaining share over us. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re not swapping share with each other and maybe they\u2019ve got a story about this or that but when you just look at overall numbers we\u2019re gaining share in database.","Brad Zelnick","It\u2019s really helpful to hear you frame it and hear it first hand from you. Just really quick really for you, Safra, can you please remind us of your view on CapEx spending this year? And does the deceleration of CapEx spend in the quarter signal anything around future PaaS\/IaaS revenue? Thanks again.","Safra Catz","Well, I think our capital expenditures will be very similar to last year. As I mentioned to you last year, we spent about $1 billion in kind of CapEx associated with the cloud. We spent about $1 billion in our real estate expansion. And the way that CapEx works really is there\u2019s a certain amount when we open data centers, and that cost quite a bit to just get started.","And then the buildout is a little bit less because there\u2019s abasing starting block. So I think we -\u2013 and what happens is you start to get really major economies of scale as you \u2013 once your setup is basically set up, straight and ready to go. So I see it like last year.","A lot of growth, about half of it is in real estate which I don\u2019t expect to continue necessarily as much on that side. So no, no deceleration, just trying to get some economies of scale as we build out. We\u2019ve got some plans but nothing. Now the revenues are coming in so that\u2019s why we\u2019re having the improvements in margins.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Adam Holt, MoffettNathanson.","Adam Holt","As you will know, I\u2019ve been highly focused on your maintenance revenue of all things and this was the strongest license quarter we\u2019ve seen in really a long time. Can you talk a little bit, was it just the BYOL that drove the license revenue in the quarter? And shouldn\u2019t the stronger relative license revenue start to drive maintenance a little bit even faster?","Safra Catz","Yes, absolutely. So it\u2019s not only BYOL. It\u2019s also in preparation for Autonomous Database. So understand that to get the benefit of Autonomous Database in the Oracle cloud, you bring your own license, but you may also, you will also need depending on which service you need, you\u2019re going to need some of the options in addition.","And also, as you bring your own database licenses, you\u2019re going to want to have app server licenses and middleware licenses in order to work with your database. So all of that, that BYOL is a fundamental change and is significantly different from how SaaS works.","And that\u2019s what I try to explain. In SaaS, you are now doing a SaaS subscription, you\u2019re no longer using your license. You don\u2019t need to buy more licenses, and you shelve your support. With BYOL, you buy additional licenses, you bring them to our cloud and you continue to pay support. And that is going to be very significant going forward. And it\u2019s already, you already see it in this quarter already. And we announced it in OpenWorld. OpenWorld.","Adam Holt","If I could just ask a follow up on that because I\u2019m getting a lot of questions about this and I just want a point of clarification. Is there any kind of a lag between people buying the licenses and renewing maintenance first, and then moving to the cloud? Because I think what some of us are trying to reconcile is the cloud guidance is a little bit slower than it has been. So it looks like something might be decelerating a little bit, and I just want to understand, is there a gap as people maybe buy licenses on premise? And then maybe it\u2019s a quarter or two before they deploy in the cloud? Just trying to understand those mechanics. Thanks so much.","Safra Catz","The mechanics are not automatic, so let\u2019s actually set this up. What has clearly happened, and I could already see this even at OpenWorld in talking to customers, they now understand that they will want to have more licenses.","So as their unlimited agreements are starting to expire, they could have historically pick up. I\u2019m going to rent all my licenses going forward, there\u2019s no point in owning them, they would\u2019ve certify those licenses and stopped buying additional and renewing unlimited agreements.","So what they\u2019ve now seen is there pathway with BYOL gives them complete flexibility of when they are ready to move to the cloud, but that there\u2019s a benefit in owning your licenses and buying more and renewing support.","So customers moved to the cloud when it makes sense for them. Autonomous Database, which is coming out in a little while here, that\u2019s going to be an enormous driver for customers to actually move there important workloads to the cloud. You understand? The two are related, but not the same. Larry, I don\u2019t if you want to...","Larry Ellison","I'll just chime in very briefly. Yes, they buy the license first, and a lot of customers are waiting for the Autonomous Database to become available. So we\u2019ve seen a big uptick in renewals of ULA, these unlimited license agreements.","The sale of certain options that are required for the Autonomous Database, that\u2019s specifically rack and multi-tenant. The multi-tenant option those two options, and the high reliability option is called Active Data Guard.","So all of those customers are buying those and then the Autonomous Database then rolls-out and begins to scale in January. So a lot of customers will have their first experience \u2013 the first big move of Oracle customers databases to the cloud really will begin in January.","There\u2019s been no big migration anyplace of Oracle databases into anyone\u2019s cloud, including ours. There\u2019s been some, but it\u2019s a relatively very, very small business. This all begins to happen starting in January, where the capabilities of cloud are so much better. Or the economics in the cloud are so much better than what\u2019s available on premise, that we think our customers are going to move very, very rapidly to the cloud. But they are waiting for our Autonomous Database.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo.","Philip Winslow","Safra, just a follow up for you on bringing your license and the subscription revenue versus license. Obviously you talk about the benefit of the license here and we saw in this quarter, and obviously we have seen on the total revenue guidance had a consensus for next quarter, but as Amit just pointed out cloud below. I wonder if you could help us just sort of walk through. It seems like obviously you\u2019re pouring more water into the license bucket, sort of less on a relative basis, than in the cloud. Just because obviously PaaS versus IaaS is probably 40% less for IaaS than PaaS. Could you just help us walk through the math kind of how you\u2019re thinking about the impact of BYO kind of on those two buckets?","Safra Catz","So there are a few things going on here. Remember, when you bring your own license to Oracle IaaS, the service you purchase is more expensive than the basic IaaS because you get all of the autonomous \u2013 all of the capability you wouldn\u2019t otherwise get, first of all. But you cannot divorce the margin of just IaaS without remembering that both licenses are being purchased, and support is continuously paid. ","That\u2019s why you heard me say, maybe you heard me say, the so-called on-premise license, because it\u2019s actually now that we\u2019ve launched BYOL, it is actually a misnomer because the customer \u2013 it\u2019s currently categorized on our income statement as on-premise software and support, for that matter. Those are called on premise, but there\u2019s nothing on premise about them. You can bring them to the cloud.","So you have to understand how much money in that pool because with SaaS on the applications side, remember, we don\u2019t sell you a new license, you no longer renew your support, and you start renting SaaS licenses and the service all bundled together.","So in this case, to the extent that - and, by the way, I just want to be clear, customers have the option if they don\u2019t want to bring their own license, to buy, to rent licenses through PaaS. That\u2019s also available to them. But financially for both them and us, it actually works out best if they bring those licenses and those with unlimited agreements can bring an unlimited amount of licenses to our cloud as well as continue to use whatever they\u2019ve got still on premise at their own state while continuing to pay support and buying additional licenses. So the math is more complete and very profitable for both us and the customer.","Philip Winslow","Just shows up in different places. Understood. And just a very quick follow up for Mark on the cloud machine. Obviously, you called out that there\u2019s a deployment lag there and that it sort of cost you 6 points of reported growth. Just curious what customers are saying to you about cloud machine versus the BYOL to the public cloud. Just any comments there about sort of the success you\u2019re seeing. Thanks.","Mark Hurd","Well, our strategy has been to give the customer choice. So to the point that Safra is bringing up, you have a choice to using whatever currency you\u2019d like. You can buy as a license, which means the customer buys one time as a traditional license transaction and can bring that to the cloud. And you can bring to the cloud a couple of different ways.","If you\u2019re in one of these highly regulated environments like I described, you can bring it to the cloud, utilizing the cloud machine, which is a very effective way of getting most of the benefits of the cloud without having to go through some of the hoops I described a few minutes ago. Or you can bring that license all the way to the Oracle public cloud.","Some customers, frankly, use it as a continuum because, back to Larry\u2019s earlier point about the autonomous database, it isn\u2019t just about the flexibility of how you pay for it, the benefits now, most of our customers now have the opportunity with the Autonomous Database to simply get out of patching. That may sound like a really trivial issue when you say it on a conference call with an analyst.","It is huge to all our customers. I sit in rooms with CEOs talking but how the heck do I get out of this damn patching? Some of our customers have 12-month lag time between the release of a patch and when they can get it implemented, the release of a patch from us and when they get it implemented. ","This Autonomous Database actually eliminates all of that. It eliminates all of the labor they may have on premise, actually DBAs and so forth that are actually running these databases. And we\u2019re trying to give the customer we think now exactly what they want. They can take advantage of this either on premise, they can now take advantage of the Oracle cloud in their data center with the cloud machine, or they bring it to the Oracle public cloud. And if you want to buy it as a license, you want to buy it as a cloud service, it\u2019s totally up to you.","So that\u2019s been our strategy, Phil. And frankly, to Safra\u2019s point about the economic model, we\u2019re fine either way the customer wants to do it. And so that\u2019s our strategy. And I think, my opinion for what it\u2019s worth, is whether that shows up in a license and then brought to our cloud, that\u2019s great for us.","Whether deployed on the cloud machine, and granted Larry\u2019s point about the latency between order booking and eventual deployment, it is what it is for a short period of time, but that\u2019s just yet another thing that differentiates us from what anybody else can do in the market today. I hope that helps.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Sarah Hindlian, Macquarie.","Sarah Hindlian","There is really one thing I want to ask Safra that you mentioned, which was tax repatriation and possible implications of the Tax Code changes here in the U.S. I\u2019d love to hear more about how Oracle is thinking about it and different ways you can deploy your balance sheet. If you could expand on your earlier comments, that would be very much appreciated.","Safra Catz","Well, to the extent that repatriation is part of the final bill, and to the extent that whatever is the rate for the cash that we bring back, either what we actually have or the deemed repatriation, that will make available to us under $60 billion, depending on the tax of cash that we can use for whatever would be available for us. We haven\u2019t made any decisions about how we would use it. I believe that it is mandatory repatriation.","So, a tax will be due on all cash outside the United States for all of those companies, and I believe we\u2019d need to book it, or at least book an estimate for it in the quarter that the tax law changes. That will make our tax rate look sort of strange, but, of course, I\u2019ll disclose the amounts and all that.","I\u2019m not sure that the final rate has been set, and, whether it will actually stay in the bill. So, we hope it does. We hope they do move to a territorial system. It will make us more competitive, and we look forward to that.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne, Evercore.","Kirk Materne","Mark, I want to jump over the applications business really quickly. Just could you just talk a little bit about the competitive environment, especially around ERP and HCM and sort of what\u2019s underpinning your confidence in sort of the ARR growth numbers over the next year in that space? Thanks.","Mark Hurd","Well, first of all, underpinning my\u2026","Kirk Materne","Your $2 billion outlook.","Mark Hurd","Yes, well as I\u2019ve said several times, I really look through starting with like just our pipeline, so our pipeline is bigger than it\u2019s actually \u2013 or actually growth in pipeline, Kirk, is just as it sits this second towards the end of the year, is just superb. I don\u2019t want to go farther than that.","I\u2019m just really pleased with the progress in the number of opportunities we\u2019re getting to participate in. And that gets to the competitive dynamics. If a customer wants SAS ERP, there really isn\u2019t a competitive dynamic. So, it\u2019s really us. So, we really lead in that category. And the reason we lead is because there\u2019s nobody else. Full stop.","Now to the degree in HCM, that HCM is combined with an ERP, which is becoming more and more the fashion of what you\u2019re seeing, then we\u2019re obviously significantly advantaged. We have a competitor in SAS HCM. We don\u2019t have a competitor in SAS ERP.","Now, the other thing I\u2019d say that\u2019s at issue is for us, over the last couple of years, is getting out of our traditional base. We\u2019re getting better and better at now \u2013 because historically if you went back six, seven years ago, we\u2019d typically call on the Oracle base of customers and the other traditional older on-premise ERP company SAP. Once you bought SAP, once you bought Oracle, those people didn\u2019t move calling on the other customers.","That\u2019s all changing now. So now as customers get more aware of the difference between a traditional on-premise ERP and a new modern SAS ERP, we get a chance now to compete for their, these competitor customers that frankly, we hadn\u2019t had a chance to compete for, if you will, in the older generation of applications. So, I don\u2019t if that helps in the dynamics.","By the way, those dynamics changed, because all of us usually on this call think about the United States of America. The farther you get from the United States of America, the better the dynamics become for us. Because of our global distribution, because of our global footprint, because of our global presence, because of our global references, because of our ability to deploy in multiple SAS data centers around the world, we\u2019re even more advantaged with the farther away you get from the United States.","So I\u2019m optimistic. I\u2019m optimistic because we have great products. We got a competitive product lead in the most important application segment in the world which is ERP. We\u2019re about to go live with our applications internally and financials which now we\u2019ve already gone live with HCM. We\u2019ve gone live with other applications.","Now we\u2019ll have our flagship product automating Oracle. We\u2019re just in a great position. I know that sounds like hype and I actually believe this. So this is what\u2019s going on in the marketplace and one of the reasons why in our company, if you\u2019re inside our company, in our apps group, you feel the sort of confidence and swagger that you see around our apps group today.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Kash Rangan, Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan","A couple of questions for Safra. One, Safra, do you think as the business continues to get scale, that operating income growth rate can continue to accelerate and outpace revenue? And secondly, just sort of a clarification, when you look at the guidance for cloud growth rate and kind of correlate that against what Mark said with respect to SaaS ARR bookings growth which looks to me about 40%, 50%. If you back that out of your cloud guidance for Q3, it looks like the IaaS\/PaaS business, maybe it\u2019s a temporary thing as down to slightly flattish. So I just want to clarify that\u2019s the way we should be modeling the two different line items and how we should be interpreting your cloud guidance. Thanks. That\u2019s it for me.","Safra Catz","For your first question, yes, I think that operating income is going to grow faster than revenue because we get economies of scale, we have margin improvement, and the business is growing. And when it grows, we get economies of scale that allow us to grow income, operating income faster than revenues. And I\u2019m quite sure of that.","I think you should not confuse bookings with revenue, and PaaS and IaaS forecast looks good. I\u2019m not giving you \u2013 I\u2019m not breaking them down for you, but I expect them to be positive and consistent with what you would have seen. And just as a reminder, the PaaS\/IaaS includes a piece that is not growing and a piece that is growing. The piece that\u2019s not growing is like 200 something, 240 \u2013 I can\u2019t remember.","Mark Hurd","Just to try to help, I think the right word that Safra used is consistent. You should think of it being roughly the same in growth rate as you saw cash and the legacy piece is $0.5 billion, roughly speaking, annualized. So that would give you some help I think for the scale of the business. Actually, maybe a little more that but it\u2019s roughly right, Kash.","Kash Rangan","So the comparables will get easier next year. I would think that for PaaS and IaaS you should start to resume that growth.","Mark Hurd","No question about it.","Safra Catz","No question because the PaaS\/IaaS that we care about, the one we\u2019re focused on is growing 40 something percent.","Operator","Thank you.

Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or any publicly release of information revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Before taking questions, we will begin with a few prepared remarks and with that, I will turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Okay. Thanks, Ken. I am traveling today, so I hope you can hear me all right. I am going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I will then review guidance for Q3 and then turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments. This quarter currency was a 2% headwind to new license and 1% to hardware and total revenues, so my comments today generally reflect constant dollar growth rates.","Q2 was a solid quarter overall as we exceeded our forecast in all major revenue segments and we are pleased with the results. Total software revenues were $6.9 billion, up 5% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove about half of total company revenues at $4.5 billion, up 7% from last year.","Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenue was $2.4 billion, up 1%. As many of you know, we had an absolutely fantastic Q2 last year with new software license growth way above expectations of 18%. So we are actually very pleased because that was quite a tough compare and over the last two years we grew 19%.","Looking at GAAP results by region, the Americas grew 5% with Latin America showing excellent growth. EMEA grew 3% and Asia-Pacific declined 10% with Japan continuing to be challenged. Currency continues to be a significant headwind in Japan and Australia. Now while our China business is not large enough to make a significant difference to our business, we did actually see good growth there this quarter.","Within software, database continues to do well with Exadata software, GoldenGate and TimesTen In-Memory software products, all up more than 20%. Also strong was human capital management, both on-premise and SaaS as well as our retailing and Life Science verticals. The quarter, by the way, wasn't dependent on any one large deal.","Overall the hardware business, including hardware support grew 2%, with hardware system product revenue up $714 million and not only have our engineered systems continued to show excellent growth, but they have actually become a material part of our overall hardware business now accounting for nearly 30% of all hardware product sales. While it is still early in the customer adoption cycle, the new M-Series and T-Series servers saw good growth sequentially.","For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 1% higher over last year and the operating margin was 46%. We believe we can invest for growth and make money as we continue to see the leverage of our business model.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.69, growing 9% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 20% and GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.56, up 7% in constant currency. Free cash flow increased 14% to a record $14.6 billion over the last four quarters. Our consistent growth of free cash flow over the last [three] [ph] years has resulted in our surpassing IBM which, as you know, has seen declines in the last eight of the last 12 quarters and we now have nearly $37 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $13 billion.","As we said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through earnings growth, stock repurchases and a dividend. In this quarter, we repurchased 83.4 million shares for a total of $2.8 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased nearly 323 million shares for a total of $10.7 billion, paid out dividends of nearly $1.9 billion for a total that is nearly 90% of our free cash flow. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share for the quarter.","Now to the guidance. New software license and cloud subscription revenue is expected to range from 2% to 12% in constant currency and 1% to 11% in reported dollars. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from a negative 1% to a positive 9% in constant dollars and negative 2% to a positive 8% in reported dollars. As a result, total revenue growth on GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 7% in constant dollars and 2% to 6% in U.S. dollars.","Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.68 and $0.72 in constant and reported dollars. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.54 to $0.58 in constant dollars and in reported dollars.","Now, this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 23% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%, and of course that may end up being different.","With that, I will turn it over to Mark for his comments.","Mark Hurd","Yes. Thanks, Safra. I will just add a couple of comments and turn it to Larry. We had solid sales execution and beat forecast in all segments. We had good results in Europe; in the Americas, Latin America was strong for us.","Database continues to show good performance due in part to strengthened Exadata and database options and we have not yet begun to see the coming benefits of 12c, which will help drive license growth.","Exadata and all our Engineered Systems had booking growth of nearly 35% on top of similar growth last year. All six Engineered Systems saw double-digit revenue growth, including the Big Data Appliance and SPARC SuperCluster, which saw triple-digit growth. Our Engineered Systems business is now big, delivering strong consistent growth in our hardware business, including support grew 2% in constant currency.","In Cloud, we had bookings growth of 35%, and saw excellent growth across all major product pillars. Fusion SaaS was even better with HCM, sales force automation and ERP, all up triple digits. We are adding customers at high growth rates, contract sizes are growing and hundreds of customers are now live on Fusion SaaS.","In HCM, we had excellent growth in all pillars, core HR, payroll and talent cloud. Let me list out just a few wins. British Telecom, Siemens North America, Carlson Wagonlit, Health Net, InterContinental Hotels, PPG Industries, Cummins, Government of Rotterdam, Southwestern Energy, PDG Realty in Brazil, CEMEX, Marks & Spencer, Scripps Health, those are HCM.","BT and Siemens are especially noteworthy as they will both be servicing employee bases of more than 60,000 employees. In customer experience we saw growth across all four pillars, marketing, sales, service and social cloud. Key wins at Oshkosh Truck, All Nippon Airways, Live Nation, Tesco, The Washington Post, Procter & Gamble, Perry Homes, CRH Building Materials, [Econ] [ph] Europe, Queensland's state government, TomTom, LifeScan Canada.","In ERP, while still early we saw triple digit growth in ERP, with many of our wins net new ERP customers to Oracle. This quarter, we issued new releases in HCM, talent, sales, marketing and social cloud. We also introduced Hyperion Planning and Budgeting as a cloud service and we expanded our data center talent to 17 locations globally with Canada, Germany and Brazil coming online soon.","I will spend a little more time on cloud this quarter as I think it's important to understand what we are seeing and that we are gaining traction. Our Cloud and Engineered Systems business have hyper growth like characteristics, inside to Safra\u2019s point, the largest cash flow company in enterprise technology. The growth of just our software business is more than double the revenue of Workday.","Let me with that turn it over to Larry.","Larry Ellison","Thanks, Mark. Oracle enters 2014 with a refreshed version of the key products that are expected to drive growth over the next calendar year. Oracle's latest database version 12c was specifically designed for the cloud.","Oracle 12c makes all your Oracle applications multitenant applications without you having to make any changes to your applications whatsoever. Oracle 12c also dramatically speeds up all your Oracle applications by making them in-memory applications without you having to change a single line of your application code.","Oracle's Fusion Cloud applications for HCM, CRM and ERP, all have a new simplified user interface and an integrated social network that makes our enterprise applications as easy to use and familiar as Facebook, while enabling better collaboration and teamwork among your employees and your customers. All these new application interfaces were specifically designed for use on modern mobile devices like telephones and tablets.","Bookings for our cloud applications grew strongly this quarter, 35%, reflecting a continuously improving win rate versus the new generation of SaaS specialist. Our Engineered Systems bookings also grew rapidly, 34% in this quarter. We think these three product areas, database, cloud applications and engineered systems will drive Oracle's growth in calendar year 2014.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Larry. Operator, if we could now begin the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities","First for Larry. I know it\u2019s early for Oracle cloud infrastructure and Platform as a Service but can you update us on where you stand there? We are seeing really good growth out of Amazon. I know your approach is a bit different but if you could update us on your strategy and where we stand on that?","And Mark, if I could just get a little clarification from you on the growth rate on the cloud side. I think you said 35% bookings growth and a triple digit for HCM, CRM and ERP. Was that revenue growth or bookings growth?","Mark Hurd","Rick, why don't we let Larry start and then I will.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities","Yes. Thank you.","Larry Ellison","Okay. Well, Rick, as you know, our strategy is to be a player in all three parts of the cloud. All three levels of cloud: SaaS, cloud applications, platform and infrastructure. We think we are going to be especially strong in platform where our two platform brands, our database brand is the Oracle Database 12c and our programming language brand is this thing called Java.","So we think we have a much stronger platform than any of our SaaS competitors. Let's just start from there. If you look at SalesForce.com and Force.com, you look at their platform capabilities versus the Oracle Database and Java and we think we have a considerable advantage and of course all of our SaaS, all of our applications are built on the Oracle Database, built on our platform, our database and our Java server.","Finally, down at the infrastructure level, we intend to be price competitive with Amazon and Microsoft Azure and Rackspace. So we intend to compete aggressively in, what I will call, commodity not being a bad word, the commodity infrastructure as a service marketplace. But we are not going to that alone. It is not going to be just infrastructure as a service. Our intention is to sell our customers infrastructure as a service and the same customer a highly differentiated platform as a service will let us get better margins and highly differentiated suite of enterprise applications for the cloud.","So we are going to be cost competitive and price competitive at the infrastructure level while being highly differentiated at both the platform level and the application level. Already we have more enterprise SaaS applications than any other cloud services provider. We will continue to expand our footprint and use our size as an advantage.","Mark Hurd","Rick, Mark. I know I threw a lot of numbers out there quick to you on the SaaS growth but what the numbers are is that our aggregate bookings growth in SaaS was 35%. Okay, point one. That includes all of our products. What I was pointing out was that if you look at Fusion HCM, Fusion Sales Automation and Fusion ERP, those three grew in bookings triple digits. That's the delineation.","Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities","Great. Thank you.","Mark Hurd","Okay.","Ken Bond","Next question, please.","Operator","That will come from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse","Congrats on a great quarter. A lot of time on the call was spent on cloud applications and database, but I want to focus my question on hardware. Obviously, you guys showed some upside to consensus this quarter and you guided next quarter for hardware to grow year-over-year, I guess, this is for both, Mark and Larry. I wonder if you could just give us more comments on what you see on Exadata, Exalogic, Exalytics and then also compare that to just sort of where we are with the [inaudible] business?","Mark Hurd","Yes. I will start and let Larry add. Bookings growth in engineered systems, as I mentioned, was 35%. Important Phil to know, this is a big business now, so, we had 35% growth this quarter against a similar growth rate last year, so this is a compounding effect for us.","All six of our engineered systems in the quarter had double-digit revenue growth, and as I mentioned, it was really encouraging I think for us to see SPARC SuperCluster had an excellent quarter for us in addition to Exadata. I mean, we had big wins, no not actually big wins, I mean we had we had very important name wins P&G, Verizon, AmerisourceBergen, ICICI Bank [in] [ph] China, Televisa, Exalytics was strong in the quarter, Phil, we had Petrobras from an Exalytics perspective. Again, a very broad based set of customers, very consistent across our regions in terms of performance and again very strong bookings growth against a very strong compare.","I will let Larry add anything he would like.","Larry Ellison","Yes. I think our Engineered Systems business really has two parts. One is Exadata, Exalogic and Exalytics, all of which really built their reputation in the marketplace for high performance and of course you can take that high performance in performance or you can take it in lower cost.","The other thing we have introduced recently are lower cost engineered systems. They go after the mass and price-sensitive parts of the market, so we have announced an Oracle Virtual Compute Appliance, a bunch of low cost commodity servers running Linux, integrated in our case with InfiniBand, connected with InfiniBand versus the traditional Ethernet, but our system comes with its own VM. It's kind of an industry standard Xen-based VM, the industry standard Linux, standard commodity servers with a high speed networking interface.","We have, again, that's called the Oracle Virtual Compute Appliance. It's relatively new and it's very aggressively priced and we think it's a mass market product that competes against our friends at Cisco. We also have had for some time the Oracle Database Appliance, another low-cost mass market product, so we expect to sell a lot of engineered systems not just the well known high end Exadata machines, but a complete suite of machines that go from extreme high performance, the ability to build large scale clouds out of the commodity servers.","Mark Hurd","You know, Phil, I think just before we leave the point on hardware, a couple of other points to Larry's point about what we call the ODA, which is the Oracle Database Appliance, we are now at a point where we are roughly at 2,000 of those units. We don't talk about that product much, because to Larry's point it's a more entry-level system, but we\u2019ve had great success with it.","On the sort of core server side, it's going to be very interesting for us to see how much share we gained in the quarter. Our M and T Series, the SPARC line, if you will, actually grew sequentially, so if you looked at them quarter-to-quarter, we actually grew sequentially and our decline in that business was actually quite small year-on-year and when you look at that, obviously, compared to our Core Unix competitors, that's going to be a big gain. When you add that to the Engineered Systems' performance in the quarter, our aggregate hardware business just gained a lot of market share.","Ken Bond","Next question, please?","Operator","That will come from the Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I have a couple of questions, but first maybe Mark and Safra. If I look at your performance on a constant currency basis by geo, the U.S. was up 5% and I think you are now 9% growth in the first half of this year.","EMEA looked better, obviously, on a sequential basis in Q2, but APAC looked like the one region where there was more trouble and it was down, I think, 10% on a constant currency basis, so could you maybe talk a little bit about what you see happening at least from a macro perspective, maybe some of the changes to the leadership there and how do you think about Asia performing over the second half of the year?","Mark Hurd","Why don't I start, Jason, and I will let Safra chime in afterwards, if she would like to. I think you are right in your assessment. I think we had a good quarter in Europe again. I think when you get the read-throughs across our industry it is even broader than that. Our Europe team has performed well. We have said before that our Europe team realigned itself early. There is no question in our mind that our Europe team is taking market share. They have performed well not only this quarter but, frankly, over a consistent period of time. I think we feel very good about our position in Europe and the share that we are gaining.","In U.S., I think you are right as well. I think U.S. had a solid quarter, overall, all-in with what we expected. And as you know, that was going against a tougher compare from last year. Asia has been rocking for us. It's obviously rocking from a macro perspective. Safra mentioned the good news was our performance in China. And our performance in China was actually quite strong.","Most of the issue involved in the quarter was in Australia and New Zealand which continues to be a difficult market there. I do not believe that to be an Oracle issue. I believe that more to be a macro issue. We really feel in the long-run that we have got a very strong upside opportunity in Asia. We have put, to your point, some new energy into Asia, some new excitement into Asia and we expect it to pay off.","So those would be my comments about Asia, to your point. If Asia had done a little better, you can imagine how much would the performance we would have delivered in the quarter. It would have been even more exciting.","Safra Catz","Yes, the other part for us for Asia, what we call Asia-Pacific, is merged together includes Japan, which we actually expect to bounce back this quarter, just between comparisons and other things. There is nothing, you know, you made a mention to the leadership in Asia-Pac or something like that and I actually don't know what you are referring to there, because there is nothing in particular going on in our Asia-Pac. So that's it. So it's Japan and Australia basically, where [our expense was] [ph].","Ken Bond","Okay. Thank you. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","We will hear from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.","John DiFucci - JPMorgan","Thank you. I think it was Larry who said that growth is going to come from database, cloud apps and engineered systems. I want to focus on the first and third of those. I guess, can you give us any more color on the database machines including Exadata and SPARC SuperCluster, I think primarily and I guess ODA also? But it is early with 12c, but has there been any impacts that 12c could be having on driving growth with engineered systems? Maybe Mark, even any anecdotes on what customers might be doing with 12c coupled with Exadata that might be different than what they did with 11g?","Mark Hurd","Well, I will let Larry start and I will add some color after that.","Larry Ellison","Okay, let me add one more engineered system, which is our M6 In-Memory system. As you know, there is a lot of interest now in in-memory databases. We announced the Oracle 12c In-Memory option and you couple the Oracle 12c In-Memory option with an M6 with 32 terabytes of main memory. That's 99.99% of all the world's databases can be now kept in main memory with orders of magnitude improved the performance. So we think that's going to be a very interesting combination.","So 12c, we think, is interesting to a lot of cloud companies and companies that are not in the business of reselling applications but are building private clouds. So the combination of selling it to net suites of the world that allows them to offer a higher quality service at a lower cost or big banks and telecommunication companies that allow them to build an effective private cloud. We have seen more interest in 12c than any database version in recent memory. The multi-tenant option and the in-memory option, I think, are going to have very rapid uptake in 2014 and 2015.","Mark Hurd","I think, John, in addition, we are yet to see the 12c benefit in our results sort of point one.","Point two, to your point about Engineered Systems and database side. Clearly, the opportunity for us to now consolidate Oracle environments in big accounts is extreme. Most of our customers have found tens and tens and tens of ways to configure the Oracle database. They have Oracle 8, 9, 10, 11, they have multiple different types of operating systems, multiple different types of hardware platforms, so the opportunity for us to simplify and standardize those Oracle environments and our customers typically spend 10s and 10s and in many cases hundreds of millions of dollars a year, to operate the Oracle database environment because of that complexity.","Our ability to simplify this and standardize this on Exadata, on our engineered systems with 12c, the formation of what would be private clouds and database-as-a-service for our customers, gives us a chance to save our customers in some cases 30% to 40% out of their total costs on the Oracle environment. This is an extremely big opportunity for us and 12c is just one of the added opportunities we have now to consolidate those environments.","Larry Ellison","I think one part of your question was 12c and does it drives even more growth than the engineered systems, especially Exadata and SPARC SuperCluster, and the M6 in-memory machine and I would say, absolutely yes.","John DiFucci - JPMorgan","Larry, my question kind of goes back to something you said earlier, especially with the multi-tenancy option, because our due diligence in talking to customers anyway was this is something they are waiting for, so that they can put multiple applications on one Exadata and be able to manage those applications in isolation, in a way that they couldn't before and it just seems like that that brings that step function up and efficiency and I was just wondering if anybody has actually done that at least in their labs yet or. I mean, it makes a lot of sense, but are you seeing any of it yet?","Larry Ellison","Yes. We have seen a number of customers take it and do it in the laboratory. Of course, this is back to what Mark was saying. They have lots and lots of Oracle environments and they want to consolidate it onto a smaller number of machines and reduce the amount of labor required to manage all of those machines.","Exadata, with all of this extreme performance, a lot of people have questioned the size of the Exadata market, saying, \"Well, how many people need that kind of extreme performance?\" Well, it's not a matter of one Exadata machine providing extreme performance to one application. It's one Exadata machine that allows you to get rid of 50 machines or 100 machines and consolidate those 100 separate applications and those 100 separate databases on that single Exadata machine and manage it as a single environment and that's exactly what the multitenant option does.","It's what Mark was saying, our customers spend a fortune managing tens, hundreds, thousands of different Oracle environments, different Oracle versions. They have to patch them, upgrade them, back them up, do all of those things. We can simplify that, make that a more reliable process, make that a less expensive process, by using the multitenant option on top of Exadata, so it's a huge opportunity for us to sell into our installed base, lower our customers' overall cost of managing the Oracle environment and get them a better overall experience in terms of performance, reliability and maintainability.","John DiFucci - JPMorgan","Great. Thank you very much.","Ken Bond","Next question please?","Operator","We will hear from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you. Safra, you have built one of the most profitable companies in technology as measured by operating margins and I guess I just wanted to ask, how we should think about the puts and takes you see as related to Oracle's non-GAAP operating margin expansion as you look out over the next two to three years?","Safra Catz","Well, I think what you can see in our numbers right now is that year-over-year the difference is really we have invested in sales capacity right now as compared to last year and we expect that to pay off, so remember the big things that impact our margins are, first, our enormous installed base of customers who pay us either for license updates and product support or for running systems for that. Those numbers are going to continue to grow.","Simultaneously, as you know, as Mark talked about, and he's going to chime in, in a second, we decided that we were really going to lean in to the cloud to get market share and we were going to be able to do it unlike all those cloud companies. We were actually, still as a company, going to make a large amount of money and so we have ramped up the sales organization and we are at full strength and it takes time for that to pay off but at that point your expenses are at one level and now the revenues come in.","So we think we still have a lot of room as we expand our installed base, as you know, continue to grow every quarter and now we are going to start seeing expansion in the margins as the revenues follow through. Mark, do you want to add to that?","Mark Hurd","Sure. No, I think to add to Safra's point, a lot of that sales resource that we have hired up that's in our current period expense is driving that 35% bookings growth in cloud. The great news is it's 35% bookings growth in cloud and triple digits in some of our core Fusion modules. The bad news is, it's not licensed. It shows up as subscription and becomes a continuous revenue stream for us over time.","So we have hired into that, to Safra's point, put those resources to work and they are busy building that subscription base. As that goes through the process of becoming annual subscription and it becomes recurring revenue, it behaves a much more like our support business than it would our license business. So we have purposely hired up. By the way, we are really happy now that we have had our sales organization in this sales model now for almost a couple of years.","We have had them in the same sales model for a couple of years. We are happy with their progress and I think this quarter, particularly in the cloud, with a number of new logos, the growth in our core Fusion areas and just the absolute growth. This is promising and will over a period of time it will have the effect on operating margins that Safra described and remember even when our licenses are flat, and I am not trying to make that a good number, but even when they are flat, all that means is we have got just as many new subscribers this year as we did last year and with our retention rates and support you know what happens to our operating margins over time. They just continue to expand.","So again, I will tell you what I said in my script earlier. I think you have got a company here that has fantastic cash flow with elements of hyper growth inside it and the cloud is one of them and we put resources into it to drive that growth.","Larry Ellison","I would like to chime in here too briefly saying that the mix of our products is changing. I know we got a lot of criticism when we bought Sun and we have gone through this transition where we had a growing hardware business, Engineered Systems, and a shrinking hardware business, Commodity Systems as we shied away from Commodity Systems in trying to be competitive in that marketplace.","As we more or less completed that transition now, the Engineered Systems business is now a large business and it has much higher margins than the commodity business that we have gotten out of over the last couple of years. So the mix has changed in hardware from the low margin hardware to much higher margin hardware. I am also including our storage business in that, by the way.","The mix has changed somewhat in our software business where a larger percentage of our software business are annuities or are renewals versus new licenses. That renewal business is a more profitable business. We think, as our cloud application business gets larger, that's also when annuity business that promises to be even more profitable than our license business. Time will tell but we think we are going through a number of changes in mix to our overall products that we sell and that's very, very positive for our margin improvements in the future.","Ken Bond","Thank you. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","And that will come from Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS","Good afternoon. Larry, on the database side, you mentioned you hadn't seen this level of interest in a while and I was just curious if you could talk through, when do you think we will see the inflection point of 12c kicking in? Is it couple of quarters away? Is it a year away? And historically, the database market is considered to be a single-digit growth market. Anything changed with this release that you think can help accelerate growth beyond the historical rates that we have seen.","Larry Ellison","Well, yes. I think we will spike beyond the single-digit amount, but given with the warning the caveats that our database business is quite a large business, but I think there will be a spike in that driven by two things. The multitenant option and I don't want to deemphasize the in-memory option either.","I think you will see, I mentioned pretty rapid uptake probably starting a little bit in Q3 and then much more in our Q4 in the first half of the next calendar year. The in-memory option, I expect, people will start playing around with in the second half of the year, but as we get around this time next year, we will see good growth being driven by the in-memory option. Again, I had to go all the way back to 11i in the early days of the Internet when I have seen that much interest in new features in our database.","Brent Thill - UBS","A quick follow-up for Mark, there has been some ongoing speculation around the sales force and how they are being structured. I think you just mentioned to Heather's question. There really hasn't been any change, but I know that question many of us have gotten in the last couple of weeks and I am just curious if you could just comment.","Mark Hurd","I really can't. Only in the context of this there's just nothing to talk about. There at the territory level, Brent, we don't have any sales people changing territories, changing accounts. We are not [rewarding] anything. If anything, we are actually very happy with the model we are in and the continuity of it and the continuity of the management, the familiarization of the team with our products, we are driving a lot more training into the sales force, so one of our real tenets is just continuity.","We say continuity, continuity particularly of the relationship between the sales person and the customer. It's very important for us to have continuity with the customer and we have made it now, so that the territory changes around Oracle are a really big deal and so that level of discipline is in and nothing has just changed about it whatsoever.","Brent Thill - UBS","Great. Thanks.","Ken Bond","Next question please.","Operator","That will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Thank you. I wanted to talk a little bit about the Cloud business again. What do you see in terms of customer reception? Obviously, you have a very much increase in growth rates here, but how are you selling that? Is that kind of like account management control function in terms of you going in and a lot of deals we are seeing where you just kind of up-sell from what you have already or are these deals competitive than what you see in terms of your positioning against the competitors, the pure play ones? Thank you.","Mark Hurd","Well, will take it and let Larry chime in as he sees fit. We go to market by functional area and we call on the functional owner of that functional area particularly in areas like HCM. We will call on the Chief Human Resources Officer and talk to them about our solutions.","Now to your point, some of those are customers are current customers of Oracle HR applications and some of those customers are not. We have, we think, very strong differentiations in the area of mobility, we think is a core strength of Oracle HCM, we have social capabilities integrated into our solutions, we have got analytics, which is a very big deal integrated into our application and supposed not everything these are core differentiations in this case specifically versus workday, so, we go directly to the [CHRO] and clearly there is a role of IT in it, but we go at the CHRO acting. We call on the CHRO and then we integrate that sales process with IT.","Now, think of us doing that sort of functional area by functional area; whether that's with the CMO and marketing, the Chief Sales Officer and sales automation, et cetera. We feel very strong, Larry made some comments earlier, about our differentiation, the one I just added and that's how we go to market.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Perfect.","Larry Ellison","Let me just emphasize. We are organized against our secular competitors, so a while ago, Mark has emphasized, we haven't made any changes to sales force in a while and that is absolutely true.","A while ago though, we decided, we had to lineup an HCM sales force directly against workday. That's all they think about. Every day is competing against every workday prospect and going out there competing against workday. We have another team people that compete against Salesforce and Salesforce Automation. We have another team that competes against Salesforce in service automation and customer experience. We have another team that focuses on ERP and SAP and so far it's the cloud ERP which is a relatively new market where that team is focused entirely on Workday. So Workday is really not in cloud ERP yet. That's an area they would like to get into but we watch that very closely. We are organized. We are organized by functional area so we can compete effectively against these new generation of specialists.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Okay. Thank you.","Ken Bond","Next question, please.","Operator","And that will come from Brad Reback with Stifel Nicolaus.","Brad Reback - Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks a lot. Mark, maybe a quick question. I am back on the Salesforce and productivity. Obviously you have hired a lot. This has grown faster than revenue but maybe you can give us a sense of where we are in the productivity curve and will you reach full productivity this year or is it sometime in next year?","Mark Hurd","No, we would not reach full productivity as, again, remember what we said a little earlier, that a reasonable amount of our hiring has gone into the cloud. And as a result, many of those resources are selling annual recurring revenue. And that annual recurring revenue would be a percent of what you would normally have had in the old license business. So you have got a period of time for those people to get productive and get revenue, and again, it starts all with what we announced today. It starts with bookings and then you drive that booking over a period of time and you build a subscription base.","Normally speaking, you would think it would take you a couple to three years to get to that full productivity of the equivalent of a recurring stream of revenue to what you would have typically seen in license. Now that said, some of our resources have gone into what you would think of as the traditional license business. And by the way, you see some of those results in areas like what we have in Europe. So an example, we hired up in Europe very early in the process that Larry was just talking about and it's showing up with our market share gains and you see evidence of that across many of our regions.","So the best way to answer that is sort of a hybrid impact. We have more resources. We are seeing the productivity helping us gain share in many of our core markets. In cloud, we are in early days. And as we talked about today, it all starts with bookings. I would say that we have gotten more and more comfortable with now the size of the distribution pipe and really our focus now is on their productivity.","The engineering of the sales process, as Larry and I have gone through a couple of examples up today, mean that they are standard sales place for our sales force to go execute, training our sales force and maturing that sales force. So that's really where we are in the process.","Brad Reback - Stifel Nicolaus","Great. Thanks very much.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Mark. Operator, I think we can turn the call back to you for closing in a moment but I will make some closing remarks here. Thank you all for joining us today. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions on this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us again. Happy holidays and I will turn it back to the operator for closing.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you again for your participation.

Now, I\u2019d like to turn today\u2019s call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead sir.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Oracle\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.","As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today.","As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.","And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we will begin with a few prepared remarks.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q2, and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. As you can see, we had another good quarter. Customer adoption of our Cloud products and services continue to be very, very strong and our on premise business remains very resilient. The result was that total revenue where at the high end of my guidance and earnings per share beat my guidance by $0.01.","Today, I\u2019m going to do what I always do, which is use constant dollar growth rates on this call, so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters, as well as to reflect how we measure the business. The effects of currency movements in Q1 were a little better than expected with a 1% tailwind to total revenue. Total Cloud and software revenue were $7.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency and 9% in US dollars.","GAAP applications total revenue were $2.6 billion, up 17% and GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenue were $4.7 billion, up 3%. Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 61% from last year. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million, up 28% from last year. As our SaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin has expanded. The gross margin for SaaS in the quarter was 67%; up from 59% last Q1.","We expect to see further improvement in FY 2018 and remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins, possibly as soon as sometime in FY 2019. The gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 44%, down from 58% last quarter as our geographic build-out goes forward in response to demand, but ahead of the bulk of the revenue recognition.","When we are at scale, I expect to see major improvement in PaaS and IaaS gross margins. Total Cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 51% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $5.9 billion, up 1% from last year reflecting continued high attach of software support and renewal rates that reflect the stability of our installed base of on-premise customers.","Hardware revenues were $943 million, down 6% and services revenue were $860 million, up 5%. Total revenue for the company were $9.2 billion, up 6% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 10% from last year and it\u2019s been a while since we last reported double digit operating income growth as we undertook the Cloud transformation that affected our income statement trading upfront revenue recognition of on-premise license revenue for recurring subscription Cloud revenue.","With Cloud now in larger and more predictable share of the revenue mix, I expect that we will see additional strong operating income growth. The operating margin was 41%, which was up from 39% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25%, which was over a point higher than my guidance, negatively impacting EPS by $0.01 or so and EPS was still up 12% in USD and 11% in CD to $0.62. The GAAP tax rate was 14.5%, and GAAP EPS was up 19% to $0.52 in US dollars.","Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was 14.8 billion, up 8%; and free cash flow over the last four quarters was 12.6 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were 473 million. I expect that Cloud CapEx spending will be driven by our ARR growth and the PaaS, IaaS build-out that I mentioned earlier.","Obviously, should we see higher than expected ARR growth we would expect to see higher CapEx investments as well. We now have nearly $67 billion in cash and marketable securities, but net of our debt our cash position is about 13.6 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is 10.3 billion, up 9% in US dollars.","As we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter we repurchased 10.2 million shares for a total of nearly 500 million.","We are currently planning on bringing that rate up significantly for Q2. Over the last 12 months we\u2019ve repurchased 46.6 million shares for a total of 2 billion. And we also paid out dividends of 2.8 billion. The Oracle Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.","Now to the guidance, and I\u2019m going to give you guidance for Q2 and my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. However, there has been some currency movements and assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue and $0.02 positive on EPS.","So here we go, Q2, Cloud revenues, remember these are constant currency numbers so you are going to be adjusting them for US dollars. Cloud revenues, including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS are expected to grow 39% to 43%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 4%.","Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.64 and $0.68, up from $0.61 last Q2. That puts the USD number in the range between $0.66 and $0.70 at today's exchange rate. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate somewhere between 23.5 and 25.5 of course as usual tax rate could end up being different as it was this quarter.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark for his comments.","Mark Hurd","Thanks Safra. A strong quarter for Oracle across virtually every metric that we track. In USD total revenue was up 7, operating income was up 11, and EPS up 12. In Cloud bookings it was a strong quarter. Overall, growth was above 40%. That was an acceleration from our growth rate last year. By the way all the numbers are in CD unless I say otherwise.","Revenue up 51% now at $6 billion annual run rate. 80% of our TTM trailing 12-month software and Cloud revenue is now recurring. Now I\u2019m going to give you some SaaS revenue numbers by pillar. We were up 61% as Safra said accelerating for the 55% growth last year. ERP was up 90% organically.","Overall ERP is now over 1.3 billion annualized run rate. Fusion HCM up 109%, more than double the growth rate of Workday. [CX] [ph] all of our categories sales marketing and service were up double digits organically. Data as a service was up 53%. The business is now over 0.5 billion in annualized run rate.","Our verticals were up 20% and compared by the way of a 115% growth last year. And as good as all these SaaS numbers are, our application ecosystem and let me go through again what that is, that\u2019s our on-premise license, on-premise support and SaaS was together up 17%. When you look at any industry growth metric of the application to industry you will find numbers like 1, 2, 3 in the marketplace and market share gains we have are astounding.","The PaaS infrastructure revenue was up 28%, business analytics were up 130%, data integration up 221%. Our database ecosystem, including the same metrics I described earlier, database\u2019s service, on-premise support, on-premise license was up 3% USD in-line with industry market growth. The origin compute industry as a service were both up triple digits. ","Cloud deferred revenue was up 53%. So as I described it was a solid quarter for us in top line growth of 7% USD in revenue and 12% EPS growth in USD. A couple of predictions. I expect Q2 cloud booking growth to be strong or stronger than our Q1 growth rate. Our Cloud bookings were executing well on a very big and growing pipeline. We expect the Cloud FY 2018 full-year cloud booking growth to be quite strong.","Revenue growth now on annualized rate of $6 billion or growth rate of 51% and we are the fastest growing in Cloud Company at scale. I do want to read out to you a few logos and wins we had in the quarter just to give you some context for some of the companies that we are selling product to and I'm just mentioning a few, but in HCM this is HCM Cloud SaaS, 711, Aon, [Aries] Group, Baptist Health of South Florida, Cantor Fitzgerald, China State Construction Engineering Corporation, Cook County, eBolt [ph], Habitat for Humanity, Liberty Mutual Insurance, state of Nebraska, SUPERVALU, the Southern Company, an unnamed large financial services firm in New York that\u2019s also different from the large unnamed financial services firm we sold to in Q4.","Just a few ERP names: Advance Auto Parts, ADEO, Coach, Eurostar International, GlaxoSmithKline, Grupo Bimbo, Hilton, Honda Motor, Modine Manufacturing, Nestle, Tata Communications, United States Steel, World Fuel Services Corp. I could go on.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Larry Ellison","Thank you, Mark. On October 1 at Oracle OpenWorld, we'll announce the next generation of the Oracle database. When we deliver it by the end of this calendar year Oracle will become the world's first fully autonomous database. Based on machine learning this new version of Oracle is totally automated self driving system that does not require a human being either to manage the database or tune the database.","Using artificial intelligence to eliminate most sources of human error enables Oracle to deliver unprecedented reliability in the Cloud. We will be offering public Cloud SLAs, service level agreements for the Oracle database that guarantee 99.995% systems availability time. 99.995% availability means less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year.","To achieve that level of reliability, Oracle has to automatically tune, patch, and upgrade itself, while the system is running. AWS can't do any of this stuff, but perhaps the most interesting aspect of autonomous systems like self driving cars on our new self driving database are the economics that surround total automation. Self-driving cars eliminate the labor cost of driving, plus the high cost associated with human driving errors.","Self driving database eliminates the labor cost of tuning, managing, and upgrading the database plus avoiding all of the costly downtime associated with human error. Self driving taxis are much cheaper to operate then taxis with human drivers. Running Oracle's autonomous database is much, much cheaper than running traditional human driven databases like Amazon's Redshift.","Customers moving from Amazon's Redshift to Oracle's autonomous databases can expect to cut their cost in half or more and Oracle will be providing SLAs that guarantee those cost settings to customers that move.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Larry. Holly, we could now queue up the group for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Sarah Hindlian, Macquarie.","Sarah Hindlian","All right great thank you very much. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. The on premise business is definitely doing better, but we are obviously seeing and hearing more about very large marquee customer wins across your Cloud portfolio and now your app business is actually growing 17% constant currency, which implies you're taking market share, so I\u2019m wondering what you\u2019re seeing in terms of momentum in that Cloud portfolio and where are you see that heading and if there\u2019s really any benefit coming in from these large reference customers?","Mark Hurd","Sure. First of all, one thing you said about implying we're taking market share I just want to make sure it is clear we are. So it\u2019s - and that\u2019s why I have been trying to give this number over a longer period of time that the apps marketplace is growing low single digits, and obviously we have been up and doing this for a long period of time in terms of growing at this rate, but there is no question to your point that when you can come out with references like we have publicly with Bank of America, AT&T and others, it makes the next opportunity easy when you can reference customers at that level.","So, I think again and we have said this before, but probably better saying again that this sort of every aspect of selling in the Cloud, I think that the company holistically is getting better at. We\u2019re better, our products are better, our sales force is better, our ability to implement is better, our ability to do all of these things is just continued to improve quarter by quarter by quarter and manifest itself in the type of results we\u2019re talking about this afternoon.","Larry Ellison","Yeah, I will just add. If you look at the growth rate of our applications business in the Cloud, in excess of 60%, and you compare that to either Workday or Salesforce, the two other major players - application players in the Cloud, they are not even close. So we\u2019re much bigger than Workday in applications and we\u2019re growing faster, must be taking share. And then our primary competitor in both HCM and ERP Salesforce has been at it for 15, 16, 17, 18 years they\u2019ve been at it for a very, very long time, but we sell more new applications customer then they do every year and that may be clear. We sell double what Salesforce sells in absolute dollars. We did it last year and we will do more than that this year, and we are growing - and we're catching them very, very fast. So, to just reinforce what Mark said, we are taking share. We\u2019re taking share across the entire applications ecosystem and we\u2019re taking share from our Cloud, primary Cloud customers - of Cloud competitors as well.","Mark Hurd","Sorry, just to add, sorry to elongate the answer, but we're going to talk more about this at Financial Analyst Day after Oracle OpenWorld concludes. But again our support business and applications, when we do move a customer from our support business to our Cloud business we\u2019ve now done several of these and we get materially more revenue. We talked about this before, but it bears saying again because we sort of stopped talking about it, we get at least three times more revenue on a like-for-like basis when a customer moves from on premise support to our Cloud, and we really just, just begun to move that user base. Most of what\u2019s in our application Cloud growth that Larry just talked about is new logos.","Ken Bond","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan, Bank of America.","Kash Rangan","Hi, congratulations. One question for Mark and maybe one for Safra. Mark can you talk about the new disclosure that came out in 8-K, you talked about some really ambitious plans for your SaaS business at $10 billion in revenue, PaaS and IaaS at $10 billion as well, can you talk about - what kind of timeframe are you likely to achieve this and how much of this is from acquisitions versus organic? And question for you Safra, if you're able to achieve these ambitious targets laid out, how should we think about the margin structure of the company? That's it from me. Thank you.","Larry Ellison","Kash let me just jump in here and say that we also have an $80 share of stock price target that\u2019s part of the comp plan. We also have a target that says we will be double the market cap of IBM, double the market cap of SAP. I mean there are a lot of targets here. In terms of margin, we have a Cloud margin target that I think is 80%. ","So, actually we are well on our way to achieving in SaaS - SaaS Cloud margin target, so we expect the margins in our businesses to go up, the stock price to go up for us to distance ourselves from our, if you will, our legacy competitors and join the ranks of the new generation of the Tech companies like, as Microsoft has done and smaller companies like Salesforce and Workday. That's where we position ourselves.","So we think these are stretched targets and it will take several years to achieve them, but we think we are well on our way. We obviously believe they are achievable, but it will require sustaining the kind of performance we have delivered over the last several quarters.","Kash Rangan","And acquisitions Larry in this forecast, are they material or is it all [indiscernible]?","Larry Ellison","There is no one left to buy. And it's not like there are a lot of obvious, as we focus on the Cloud, there are a bunch of obvious targets, we can go out and buy. So we\u2019re seeing our best growth in technology that we have developed internally, our fusion ERP, fusion HCM which is the midmarket and the high end of the ERP and middle market and high-end of HCM. These are all internally developed systems. They are - HCM and ERP I think, our blended rate is growing triple digits.","The size of these markets are enormous and we think we will be able to ride that horse, pursue that organic growth and meet our targets. So, I think it\u2019s going to primarily come from internally developed technologies, the growth of those technologies and us gaining dramatic amounts of share and applications in the Cloud, and with our new autonomous database also in Platform-as-a-Service and infrastructure as a service. We have to get all cylinders firing, but the bulk of our technologies will determine our success. Things like our database and our fusion applications we all organically internally developed.","Operator","Our next question is going to come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.","Brad Zelnick","Great, thanks very much and really nice quarter guys, especially for Q1. I have got a question for Mark and a quick follow-up for Safra. Mark, the apps ecosystem is off to a really strong start with 17% growth in the quarter, but with comps getting tougher in the back half of the year as you lap NetSuite, do you still feel that the apps ecosystem can achieve your double-digit goal growth goal for the full year?","Mark Hurd","Yes. I think that I've said this I think at the beginning - towards the end of last fiscal year that I believe we grow roughly double digits in our applications ecosystem and this Q1 did nothing more than reinforce my belief. This is what we - as good as it was it is what we thought would happen, and I believe you will see that for the full-year. Our pipeline shows that everything else we have got shows that this will happen.","Brad Zelnick","Great thanks and just for Safra, Safra mapping Cloud ARR to revenue has been fairly straightforward for SaaS, but less so for PaaS and IaaS is there any color you can give us just to help understand the revenue trajectory for PaaS and IaaS? Thanks very much. ","Safra Catz","We\u2019re actually holding over 10 more points on the PaaS IaaS right now because we\u2019ve had a lot of orders and we are deploying them and we will only start recognizing them as they deploy. First of all, all of our Cloud customer is a very large amount of it, it hasn't been fully out deployed. So you are going to start seeing these match up a lot more as we go ahead and deploying get those up and running and alive. I don\u2019t know Mark, you want to add anything or\u2026","Mark Hurd","Yes it is exactly right what Safra said. We just - I have good news, good news is we have a large on provision backlog and so we will get that provision and you will start to see that fold into our Q2 and Q3 numbers as we get that provision. So the good news is we\u2019ve just got a lot of PaaS to go provision and I wish we got it all provisioned in Q1, but we didn't. So that\u2019s really the work that has been done.","Brad Zelnick","Great.","Mark Hurd","Thanks Brad.","Ken Bond","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Adam Holt with MoffettNathansonhand.","Adam Holt","Hi everyone. It\u2019s good to be back on an Oracle call and to see you all executing so well. My question is on the Cloud business and how that relates to the strengths on premise. We are obviously very strong in both applications and infrastructure on premise in the quarter, do you think that the hardening of your Cloud infrastructure and the strength in your Cloud applications business is actually starting to have a positive impact on, on premise revenue and how do you think that dynamic plays out going forward?","Mark Hurd","Well the applications business and the Cloud business, the applications business and the tech business transitions from on-prim to Cloud are very different. As we move our application customers from on-prem to Cloud we\u2019re asking them to migrate from the e-business suite to fusion. As they move from our HR, we are asking them to migrate from Oracle HR or PeopleSoft HR to Fusion HR in the Cloud. So they are really changing applications.","In the case of our technology business where you are running the Oracle database on-prem we're just asking you to lift or move your data into our Cloud. There really is no technology transition at all. So you really cannot to look at these transitions as being similar things. The interesting thing - on a very different, let's say Microsoft, Microsoft they took their existing Microsoft Office customers and moved them to the cloud, so you can save documents in the Cloud, where documents or filled documents, you move them to the Cloud. That\u2019s what\u2019s meant by Office 365.","That\u2019s very close to our database business, where we are just beginning to move them to the cloud by just taking existing applications, actually the new version of our database as I mentioned is greatly enhanced in the Cloud and there is real motive to move it from on-prem into the Cloud here. Lots and lots of benefits, but it\u2019s not a technology change. In our apps transition you actually move to a whole new technology stack. It looks like almost moving into to a new vendor if you will.","You move from Oracle E-Business Suite or PeopleSoft Financials and JD Edwards all of these on-prem customers that we have is on-prem business we have and you move to the fusion financials. That was a, that recorded a new implementation retraining your people and we did that, but that transition, as Mark just said, is just beginning. Most of our fusion ERP customers our fusion HCM customers, our new logos, and we don't expect when people move from their database from on-prem in the Cloud.","We don't expect support to go away. We expect them just bring their licenses into our Cloud and you\u2019re paying support, you have the license, you own the license, and now you run it in our Cloud and you pay us additionally for running our Cloud just like you move the Oracle data business in the Amazon, while you pay them additionally. So, it is simply lifting up your existing license, therefore you keep paying support.","You keep paying support, and you add on to that. Infrastructure is a service where platform is a service fees associated with running it in our Cloud. So we think that\u2019s a much easier transition for us. Then the transition we\u2019re making on the app side of the business. And look how well the transition on the outside of the business is going.","Q - Adam Holt","Terrific, thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore.","Kirk Materne","Thank you very much and I will add my congrats on the quarter. Mark, obviously a lot of momentum in the ERP right now, I was wondering when you look at where the market is today, if you think we\u2019re getting closer to more of a tipping point in terms of larger customers setting up to make decisions on moving their ERP systems to Cloud over the next 12 to 18 months and when you talk to customers what are some of the reasons or I guess feedback you are getting that gives you confidence in terms of taking market share in this cycle if we are about to go into one? Thanks.","Mark Hurd","Yeah, whilst you were getting a lot of - we had strong growth we had another acceleration in terms of logos. We had acceleration of ERP logos this Q1 versus last Q1, so we had more closures in terms of number of accounts and we had bigger companies looking. So it\u2019s significant to the point of your question. We also have more modules coming online. So, if you look at what we have got an ERP now, we have more localizations across more geographies, and we now have a full suite of the ERP supply chain, procurement, manufacturing, now budget and planning all available.","So it\u2019s the full suite now across almost all of our geographies. To Larry's point, I think it\u2019s worth stating, a lot of our ERP customers, now our new logos. Lots of new financials customers and lots of companies that to be very - we would have never sold to 5 or 6 years ago, companies that are really named, but when you come to Oracle OpenWorld you will see another string of customers who never had an Oracle application before until they bought Oracle financials in the Cloud.","So it\u2019s that. Then in addition to that, I think what really helps us is the fact that we are the only suite provider. So the fact that now a company instead having a bunch of point solutions can have a suite of applications and the opportunity for us to now bring HCM and ERP together to a customer gives us an incredible advantage across basically all of our customers. So you see now and the names I wrote - I read off to you, lots of what I recall high-end midmarket, low-end enterprise customers that are really the common persona of who we sell to, most of them new logos.","I think you will see that continue as we go forward. The best news I can give you is that as we start to bring our larger customers over, Oracle will get materially more revenue as we move that support because we do everything for them. We do the hardware, we do the operating system, we do, it\u2019s our data centre, we do really everything for them, and we get the extra revenue as a result of that.","Kirk Materne","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.","Phil Winslow","Hi, thanks guys and congrats on a great start to the year. I just wanted to focus on the platform and infrastructure side in particular and as you look over the overall numbers, you are still putting up very healthy growth rates here, both obviously in the Cloud with the PaaS offering, but also on premise. Mark or Safra why don't you just double click on just what you are seeing on premise side even as that PaaS is ramping that\u2019s keeping that business growing and question to Larry, obviously we\u2019re excited to hear about the new features of coming at OpenWorld, but when you think about the Oracle PaaS offering versus other infrastructure service plus DBMS out there, why is it that the Oracle Cloud can lower cost more than these competitors and therefore make it gain share there?","Mark Hurd","Okay, they are pointing to me, I guess they want me to go first. The reason we can lower cost is we just automate more. There is a big difference between, what Amazon basically does, what they pioneered was this notion of, we will rank you based on what you use, compute, and storage and you can kind of bring whatever - and they offer a couple of databases, they offer Aurora, which is MySQL, their version of MySQL and they offer Redshift, which is another - their version of an open source database. They have made some changes to it, it is no longer Open Source. It's from Amazon for queries and OLTP.","But these are technologies that are not automated. These are if you will old fashion technologies and a new fangled Cloud data centre, and available for record. So it\u2019s kind of an interesting new business model, but their database technologies are not very advanced at all. They have just picked them up at Open Source. And our database, our - especially the latest generation of database totally automates everything. So you don't - you push a button and load your data and you\u2019re done.","You don't have lots of tuning parameters and lots of things to set up like you do with Amazon. Amazon requires a lot of labor to set up an online transaction processing system based on Aurora. That\u2019s a lot of labor, it is MySQL, it is a code that we maintain. We know it very, very well, very different than Oracle. You press a button, load your data, run your analytics. It tunes itself, it backs itself up, it patches itself, it never goes down, and it\u2019s much, much faster.","Like you are saying it\u2019s much, much, much faster and then someone will say, we don't need that speed. Let me translate. If it\u2019s much, much, much faster and if it does in an hour what Redshift does in 10 hours it is one-tenth of the cost of running at Amazon because we charge the same amount for Aurora. So we take out the labor cost and because we consume less CPU and we compress the data and we consume less storage it is much - we are much more frugal about using compute and storage resources, and we eliminate the labor cost and the associate, the cost associated with human error. So we are not even trying to do the same thing as Amazon.","Larry Ellison","To your other question Phil, listen I think there is a strong interest across the board. I mean listen, we have got obviously new features that come with release 12, you know that all those with multitenant within memory, etcetera, obviously our security options are very important given the world that we live in today. We have a desire for many of our customers to get out of all this work, to get out of patching to look at to modernizing their infrastructure.","You may have heard what AT&T talked about, there will also be an Oracle OpenWorld and you will hear a lot more directly from them. But the need to not just consolidate not just get the new features to modernize those applications, but to get out of all this work to the point that Larry has described you know about now the fact that I can\u2019t deal with the amount of time it takes to patch all these hybrid environments that I have got. Now somebody - Oracle is going to do that for me, and then we are going to modernize the database, and now they are going to give me all these features, but you're not going to take all that work off my shoulders.","So there\u2019s a tremendous amount of this. Now to Larry's other point, remember most of our customers stick with some somebody like AT&T. They have over 10,000 Oracle databases in that company, 10,000. So you're going to have a handful of those big ones move to the Cloud. There is still going to be up quite a few of those that stay on premise for a period of time. So that work is just a lot of work for us to help and this is the beginning of a whole string of customers. They are going to go through this process to modernize those database environments.","Ken Bond","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of John DiFucci, Jefferies.","John DiFucci","Thank you. Thanks. I have - Safra, I have a quick, just a very quick question on the guidance and then if I could ask another question, just a clarification, you said total revenue could see, I think a 3% benefit on top of the 2% to 4% guidance you gave for total revenue right, I think I know the math is real easy here, but I just want to make sure that implies, I believe a 5% to 7% reported revenue growth if you get that 3% FX affect? Is that right by doing that math?","Safra Catz","For USD, I\u2019m going to go through the entire thing in USD for you guys because you\u2019re not the only note. In fact, you're not the only note. So, I\u2019m going to go through it. For total Cloud 41% to 45%","John DiFucci","Okay.","Safra Catz","It really comes out like 4.5 to 6.5, but I\u2019m going to say 4% to 6% and in total revenue and then EPS $0.66 to $0.70 and making EPS growth somewhere between 7% and 13%. Okay.","John DiFucci","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. But I'm the only note you need to read. But that\u2019s okay.","Safra Catz","Yes they are all like. And it\u2019s a fair question because there are a bunch of rounding, it is 5 to 7, 4 to 6 it\u2019s somewhere in the middle there, so I am always being conservative so I will say 4 to 6 on this call for you, but you know me. Okay. Was there another question?","John DiFucci","Yes, just a quick one, it is great to see the model work in the SaaS business with scale driving leverage here and I know you\u2019re going to say, we\u2019re also going to hit leverage in the PaaS and infrastructure as a service business or scale. Again I know there is a lot of variables here, but can you help us when we\u2019re looking at, when we might see this happen, when we might see this turn either the timing in next year or the year after or even the scale when the business hits approximately what scale?","Safra Catz","Okay. So it\u2019s a little bit complicated because there is a mix between IaaS and PaaS. PaaS in particular is extremely, extremely, extremely profitable and however there\u2019s really a question of when the revenues get recognized and how much investing I have to do and how we line those up. So, we are just like you signed SaaS I know that it\u2019s a time, it seemed absolutely impossible that we would have the kind of margins we now have an SaaS, it seemed impossible and yet they came and now we\u2019re closing in on hitting, so much so that I actually went ahead and gave you some time next year for that hitting. ","PaaS and IaaS are very much at least at this point in the expansion period. We expect this to be a very large business that we remain very conscious of the margins, and so we\u2019re trying not to invest too much ahead of revenue recognition, but as you see in this quarter alone we have a law that has yet to be deployed, fully deployed even though it\u2019s fully provisioned even though the equipment is all bought and being capitalized.","So this is really, I can\u2019t give you an exact time because we\u2019re going to be very much monitoring demand and reacting to that. And for us it is much more important that we expand quickly, of course mindful of margin dollars. Sometimes not as mindful necessarily of any intra-quarter margin percentages. So, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.","Mark Hurd","I think there is no mystery to this, right. This is just like the SaaS business, you have to build out some initial infrastructure to get started. You have to build it, and unfortunately you have to put it at online before you can sell it, and that\u2019s what this is. There is a start-up cost to getting in these businesses. We are PaaS that in SaaS. We are deployed in now virtually all of the critical geographies and we now have scale in most of the critical geographies. And so you see it just show up in the margin rate as it has.","We\u2019re going through that same process in infrastructure. The great news for us now, we know how this works. We know how to get it done, we know to measure it, we know how to get from here to there, and so you will see the same results. So it\u2019s just a factor of time and scale in bookings in Safra's last point, the ability then for us to get a provision so we can then recognize the revenue. So this is going to happen John.","John DiFucci","Okay, thank you. That all makes sense, but should we expect that we might need more scale? I mean would it develop similarly how PaaS SaaS did or would we expect to hit certain margins we would have to get even greater scale in this business?","Mark Hurd","No. I don't think there\u2019s any material difference in the context of scale. There is the same fundamental that\u2019s what I was trying to go through. You\u2019ve got to start up cost, you got to get a data centre, you got unused capacity to get started, and then the increments of capacity to bookings comes at a very attractive margin rate. So think of it, you have a baseline of acts. And then I get, and then I have a little bit of capacity per booking so to speak.","It\u2019s not exactly how it works, but for the sake of your analytics how it works, and we know what that increment of capacity is for that booking, and then it is just a question of scale from there. So you take the unused space and then for each booking you get so - a couple of few cents on the dollar that you have to add internal capacity, and it just becomes the time it takes to get to scale. That's it.","John DiFucci","Great, very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","And our final question for today will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow, Barclays. Raimo, your line is open.","Raimo Lenschow","Thank you. Maybe in anticipation of the Analyst Day, so I would like give a more broader question, Larry you started to use kind of, AI to kind of come up with the autonomous database, can you talk a little bit about like what more or how are you kind of see this whole thing evolving? Because there's obviously a lot of noise, a lot of hype around it. Some of the other competitors of you has come up with fancy names here, how do you guys see this play out for you guys? Thank you.","Larry Ellison","We are using machine learning all over the place. I mean everything from the very highest level to - in our HR systems, our recruiting systems to look at a bunch of candidates. And it is kind of inspect the data of people that this company has hired that had been very successful and people have been less successful. So we can actually start to bucket the candidates. You know this group, you have got 200 people you are looking at hiring, 50 over here look very much like the 50 people that you hired over the last five years that have been enormously successful for the company.","And that\u2019s the matter machine learning, using machine learning to just look at the profiles of individuals, companies hired over a period of time and make recommendations of how to prioritize candidates that they\u2019re looking at making offers to. All the way from that level to our new security systems, which are going in now, where we are doing a log inspection, where we\u2019re looking at people and the logs we look at unlike anybody else, we are in the applications business, we are in the database business, and we\u2019re in the Cloud infrastructure business looking at network logs and operating system logs, and storage hardware logs, we\u2019re also looking at database logs, we're looking at people trying to log on to application systems and the passwords they are reducing.","We have all of these logs. And we are processing all of these logs in our Cloud to for example trying to find people who are going to attack a database and steal passwords, and steal data. And we think we do this better than anybody because we look at more data. We look at application data, in other words we certainly know that you're CFO is in the Ukraine trying to log on 50,000 times in the middle of the night. Maybe you're CFO is not vacationing in Ukraine and that\u2019s not her, and there could be a problem someone is trying to break in.","We look at that level of data all the way down to IP addresses. There are strange IP addresses trying to figure out, we look at strange SQL terms, anyway we do - we look at 10 times more log information then someone like Splunk, who has been inspecting IP addresses, but not log in information. So, we get a much better picture of all the activity of what\u2019s going on inside your data centre and use machine learning to inspect this vast amount of data and see if someone is in their reconnaissance base of prior to an attack where we can shut them off while they are just looking around before they actually attack anything and then start stealing passwords and start stealing data.","Again, that\u2019s also all machine learning. We\u2019re offering that technology - again in OpenWorld we\u2019re offering, the customers can ship their logs from their data centre and into our Cloud and we will do all of that security reconnaissance and security work for them. And the more of this information we have the better equipped we are to find a malware. You find malware showing up let\u2019s say Germany, and we know what it looks like and suddenly we have worldwide alerts because - worldwide alerts to recognize that the malware that should show up in California or at a - and as we know there is a lot of securities getting more and more important these days.","The events at Equifax, very unfortunate. Events at Equifax is not going to be an isolated incident. You are going to see more and more things like this. You saw at the government's office of personal management, which was disastrous for our intelligence community. We\u2019ve got to do a better job, we got to do a better job of securing not only our Cloud, but our customer's data centers getting all of that log data using machine learning to - and basically what is a cyber war that\u2019s going to be on going for a long, long time.","So everything from helping companies using AI to help companies hire the right people to helping data centers both private data centers and public data centers protect against intrusions. It\u2019s an important new technology and it\u2019s the centre of what we are doing with database automation, security and our applications.","Raimo Lenschow","Alright. Thank you, Larry.","Ken Bond","A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today.

Please go ahead, sir.","Ken Bond","Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.","As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today.","As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal year 2016. I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q1 and provide some color on FY 2017, and then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. Clearly, we\u2019re thrilled with our results with the most obvious thing being that we dramatically over achieved again in the cloud. For most companies as their business grows, the growth rates go down. In our case, as the business grows, the growth rates are continuing to increase. In our SaaS\/PaaS business, we reported 20% growth in fiscal year 2014, 34% in fiscal year 2015, and now 52% in fiscal year 2016, and not to get ahead of myself, but we expect to see even higher SaaS\/PaaS growth this year.","We\u2019ll continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly call, so we can have some measure of consistency across quarters, as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This past quarter, the effects of currency movements were slightly less than expected with a 1% to 2% headwind in most revenue categories, including 1% to total revenue and a $0.01 headwind to earnings per share. Cloud, SaaS, and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $691 million, up 67% from last year and well above the 61% high-end of my guidance, and up 17% sequentially.","Now, as regard to our cloud revenue accounting, we have reviewed it carefully and are completely confident that it is a 100% accurate and if anything slightly conservative. You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.4 billion, up 64% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 38% in U.S. dollars this quarter.","We\u2019ve put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail. And though there will be seasonality to some of these numbers, we\u2019re now growing faster than both Salesforce and Workday in every way; revenue growth, deferred revenue growth, and billings growth.","As our Saas PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q4 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 57%, up from 40% last Q4 and we expect to see further improvements in fiscal year 2017, and from there, we\u2019ll be targeting 80% over time.","Combined with cloud infrastructures as a service revenue of $169 million, which was up 8%. Our total cloud revenue in the quarter was $860 million, up 50% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $7.6 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 4% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow.","New software license revenues were $2.8 billion, down 10%, reflecting the accelerated migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support was down 7%, with hardware systems product revenue of $725 million and hardware support revenue of $558 million. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $10.6 billion, up slightly in constant currency from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion and the operating margin was 45%.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 24.4% and EPS was $0.81 in U.S. dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 24.6% and GAAP EPS was $0.66 in USD. Had currencies not moved by the way, non-GAAP EPS numbers would have been $0.01 higher and GAAP EPS numbers would have been $0.02 higher.","Now covering the full fiscal year, total software and cloud revenues totaled $29 billion, growing 3% in constant currency. Cloud, SaaS and PaaS were $2.2 billion, growing 62%. Cloud infrastructure as a service was $646 million, growing 11%. On-Premise Software grew slightly in constant currency to $26.1 billion, as continued growth in software support offset could-related declines in new software license.","So our SaaS and PaaS business has now grown to the point that we expect the dollar growth in SaaS\/PaaS revenue will exceed the dollar declines in new software license in fiscal year 2017 and beyond. But more importantly, when you look at our software business, we have an On-Premise business basically growing a bit or flattish and the cloud business layering on top of that growing very fast and growing as a percentage of the software business, and then you can understand why we start growing significantly this year.","For the year, total revenues grew 2% to $37.1 billion, and operating income was 15.8 billion and assuming no more wild currency swings this fiscal year, I expect that we will see operating income growth this next year. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full-year was 43% and non-GAAP EPS was $2.61. Had currencies not moved, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.17 higher.","Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.6 billion, with capital expenditures for the quarter at $180 million. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.4 billion. We now have approximately $66 billion in cash and marketable securities, net of debt our cash position is approximately $12.3 billion, a short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.7 billion, up 7% in constant currency.","As we said before, we\u2019re committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right s that make both strategic and financial sense.","This quarter, we repurchased 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 272 million shares for a total of $10.4 billion. We paid out dividends of $2.5 billion for a total that is 105% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.","Now, before I turn to guidance, I would like to provide a brief update on the operational transformation that I highlighted last quarter as we are working to position Oracle as our customers\u2019 strategic partner for the cloud. The first phase called the accelerated buying experience was rolled out in March. It was designed to make purchasing cloud services from us fast and simple and was built using our own configured price quote products, sales and service cloud.","We believe that we are the first enterprise technology vendor to use click to accept functionality for enterprise customers and that enables our customers to complete their orders with a click of the button. The results for Q4 were fantastic as nearly two-thirds of our cloud deals were processed using the accelerated buying experience, and we saw the quote to book times reduced dramatically. These results are truly amazing, given the introduced the program in Q4 and salespeople had very little time to get use to it.","Our customers could then start using our services faster. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition and clearly customers are embracing the move with us. We now have the most complete set of cloud services in the industry with thousands of our customers around the world are using these cloud services to help run their businesses.","We\u2019re far enough along that our financial statements will begin to show our success with accelerating revenue growth, operating margin expansion over time leading to very solid EPS growth. Our guidance will reflect this making it easier to see that we are a force to be reckoned within the cloud.","Now, to my guidance. I\u2019m going to give you my guidance for Q1 and then some preliminary comments for fiscal year 2017. All of my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now currency \u2013 the current exchange rates remain the same as they are now. We expect to see a currency headwind of about 1% on some parts of cloud revenues, but very little effect on total revenue and EPS. And while we feel fantastic about our own performance and transformations, I\u2019m definitely keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad and going to be a big conservative in my outlook.","Even with that said for Q1, I\u2019m raising my earlier guidance for SaaS and PaaS revenue, which we now expect to grow 75% to 80%. And this guidance reflects a bit of additional revenue from acquisitions and higher guidance for the organic business.","Software and cloud revenues, including SaaS\/PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software and support is expected to grow 5% to 7%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 5%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.60, up from $0.53 last quarter \u2013 last Q1, depending on the mix of revenues and of course the tax rate.","Over the full-year for FY 2017, I expect SaaS and PaaS revenue growth will be higher than the 65%, up from 62% in FY 2016. SaaS and PaaS gross margins should exit Q4 FY 2017 much higher than the 57% reported today, as we show steady and continued improvement through the year. And I mentioned earlier \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, but operating income is also expected to grow in constant currency.","And with that, I will turn it over to Larry.","Lawrence Ellison","Thank you very much, Safra. In the fiscal year just started FY 2017, Oracle has two specifics points of focus. First, we would like to accelerate our SaaS and PaaS growth and make sure we\u2019re at least double, growing at least double the rate of our closest competitors. And we think we have a fighting chance to be the first SaaS company to make it to $10 billion in revenue. We\u2019re the second largest SaaS company in the world now and we think we can be the largest SaaS company, including our \u2013 by the time we hit $10 billion, we\u2019re going to be the first one there. Why do I think that\u2019s possible?","One is, we\u2019re already growing at a very high rate much faster than our competitors, we\u2019ve proven, we can do this. Can we keep it up as our business continues to scale. Safra pointed out something that\u2019s shocking, that as we scale our business, our growth rates are going up. Why is that? The explanation is our SaaS portfolio. We compete in virtually every important SaaS area there is.","We\u2019re a major player in ERP and HCM. We\u2019re almost the only player in supply chain and manufacturing. We\u2019re the number one player in marketing. We\u2019re very competitive. We\u2019re number one \u2013 tied for number one in service. And we compete against Salesforce.com and sales automation. But in all of these areas, we compete on Salesforce.com, which is the largest SaaS company is really focused on sales automation and some of the other customer experience aspects. They just bought Demandware. They are making acquisitions. They are growing their business, but they are in the customer experience sales area.","They don\u2019t compete in the largest category, which is ERP, also not HCM, again supply chain and manufacturing again and we think that gives us a huge advantage that our footprint is wider. And some of these mid-market companies can simply get in all Oracle footprint run their entire enterprise in the cloud on Oracle. That is something that Salesforce can\u2019t offer and we think that\u2019s going to service very well and allow us to keep these very high growth rate, while we go for that to be first at $10 billion, okay that\u2019s one thing. So we want to be one in number one. We think we need to be number one, we think we will be number one in SaaS and PaaS.","Second major point of focus is that, our generation two of our infrastructure as a service data center have been built and stocked with computers, and now we\u2019re beginning to bring our customers into these new data centers.","Infrastructure as a service is the third leg of Oracle\u2019s cloud strategy. Obviously SaaS, we talk about a lot, and PaaS, we talk a lot about, because those few businesses are growing very rapidly for Oracle. So what\u2019s going on in infrastructure as a service? Well, we\u2019ve had to move to \u2013 we\u2019ve learned a lot about this business. There\u2019s a huge amount of demand by the way for our infrastructure as a service from our existing SaaS customers and our new SaaS customers and even bigger amount of demand, for infrastructure as a service from our database customers.","Our database customers want to move their application into our cloud putting their database on to our platform as a service and then their applications, so a lot of custom applications on to our infrastructure as a service, these two things go together. And we built, again, the second generation data center, which we think is highly competitive with anything out there lower cost, better performance, better security, better reliability than any of our competitors, and there\u2019s huge demand for it, and we\u2019re now starting to bring customers into that. We think that\u2019s another very important driver to Oracle for overall growth.","We\u2019re growing fast in SaaS. We\u2019re growing fast in PaaS. Now we need to grow fast in infrastructure as a service we\u2019ve made the investments. We have the right technology with our second generation data centers, and we\u2019re very excited about the potential for Oracle with the combination of PaaS and infrastructure as a service for our huge installed base of database customers and helping them move to the cloud.","I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark.","Mark Hurd","Okay. Thanks, Larry. Just a few more numbers and we\u2019ll take your questions. Cloud bookings over $600 million in USD, 52% growth for us in CD. As a reminder, last year we grew more than 200%, so for this comparison is or this number is against that comparison.","In SaaS, roughly $350 million in USD bookings, in PaaS, over $250 million. Just one point of clarification, our ARR bookings are only for new and expansion. So I\u2019ve had some questions about do we include renewals in our bookings? We do not. Renewals are a separate bucket of bookings kept separate in our reporting. As it relates to renewals in the quarter, our renewals for the quarter were up 200 basis points year-over-year.","SaaS\/PaaS revenue we grew 67%. We grew 17% quarter-on-quarter. ERP\/EPM was 58% growth quarter-over-quarter. In HCM, we had our strongest growth rate in three years. That says our business has gotten bigger. In CX, all sales, marketing and service revenue growth rates were up double-digits. In data as a service, we nearly doubled year-over-year. Platform as a service had another break-out quarter. We nearly doubled quarter-on-quarter. Within doubling quarter-on-quarter, our database as a service business more than doubled quarter-on-quarter.","Our SaaS\/PaaS billings grew 48% in FY 2016. Our SaaS\/PaaS deferred revenue grew 64%. To Safra\u2019s point and I want to say it again grew much faster than Salesforce.com and Workday. Now, I want to come to another set of numbers that are actually probably more exciting, our customer metrics. In the quarter, we closed 1,640 new SaaS customers. Nearly, two-thirds were Fusion wins. We had 917 customer expansions that is an all-time high for us. 273 customers, who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. I want to make sure you understand that connect point. We think that connection will actually grow higher as time goes on.","Our SaaS installed base is now roughly 12,000 customers. In the quarter, we had \u2013 almost 700 CX customers in 600 expansions. In HCM, 318 new customers, 900 for the year, nearly 2.5 times that\u2019s what Workday reported. In ERP, we had 808 new customers in the quarter. I just want to make sure, I didn\u2019t misspeak, it\u2019s 808 new customers in the quarter. We doubled the FY 2016 count in Q4. Almost 50% of those customers never had an Oracle path. Our installed base is now over 2,500 customers, nearly 2.5 times the installed base from last year.","We have 1,577 customers now live on Fusion. We added nearly a 1,000 go-live this year. In PaaS, we added 2,005 new PaaS customers. Our installed base is now nearly 9,000 customers. In closing, this was a big year for us, not only in revenue, but bookings as well, where we sold more than $1.4 billion in ARR.","I\u2019m going to make just a couple predictions for the New Year. We had a big year in bookings in FY 2016. We will have a bigger year in FY 2017. Our pipeline is actually today up more than our bookings in our revenue reported growth rates. Revenue growth of 52% this year, our growth rate will be higher than 65% in FY 2017. And as Larry and Safra both mentioned, as our business gets bigger, we continue to grow faster.","So with that, we\u2019ll take whatever questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on your cloud progress. I\u2019d like to drill in specifically into Platform as a Service, two parts to my question. The first is, can you give us some more color on your success in PaaS?","And second specifically, can you help us with understanding on how you\u2019re expanding the TAM for your database middleware et cetera, and what are the drivers? Is it newer segments, high revenue attach from existing customers? Any help would be appreciated.","Mark Hurd","So, Mark, I\u2019ll start and then I think Larry is going to chip in. No question about that total available market expense because obviously when we win \u2013 just like in SaaS, if we win in SaaS, we actually get all of the middleware, all of the database, all of the hardware, we get really all of the services, so we get this multiple support that when we get an application, the whole stack comes with us.","The same thing in effect occurs when we get database as a service as well, with it comes all of the other services that come with it as well. In addition, we get to expand our TAM to a whole new set of customers that otherwise we would never have gotten too. We get now to a whole set of mid-market customers that frankly we just didn\u2019t have an opportunity to sell-through before, because you had to have a datacenter, you had to have a computer, and you had to have a staff, and so now all of that TAM is expanded as well. So with a broader market set we get to and a whole set of market share that comes with it.","The other thing is the network effect between SaaS, PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service. So if you have, let\u2019s say, your ERP application and it\u2019s an Oracle ERP application then you want to build a bunch of data warehousing applications on top of the data from your ERP system, in a sense it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to have the ERP system at Oracle and I\u2019ll put the data warehousing situation that Microsoft assure.","But if you actually look at the pricing of cloud pricing that one part of cloud that\u2019s expensive is moving data out of data center, that\u2019s one thing they charge you a lot of money for it, and that\u2019s the kind of industry pricing the way it works. So moving data between data centers back and forth, back and forth between our data centers can be quite expensive. So there\u2019s an advantage for our built in products. If we have the ERP data and we have the ERP system, we have a built in advantage by offering our PaaS and our infrastructure as a service as a set of tools to allow you to build your data warehouses in your data marks using that ERP data.","So I think that gives us a very significant advantage to us, the interaction between SaaS and PaaS and the interaction between PaaS and infrastructure as a service. I\u2019ll go back to infrastructure as a service. Well, why should they \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t it just move to Amazon. I mean, Amazon has been doing this for a while and they\u2019ve got infrastructure as a service.","Well, because we handled the Oracle database much better than Amazon does, we can run very large Oracle databases. We run [at full power that way] [ph]. We just do a better job. I mean, this is not the place for me to give you a technical proof, but we do a better job than they do on the Oracle, they run Oracle databases, but we do a much better job. We run it faster, more reliable and more securely.","Well, if I\u2019ve got the database in an Oracle \u2013 an Oracle data center in the Oracle cloud, it makes sense for me to put the application at a computer right next to that, that\u2019s higher performance, much lower cost, because I\u2019m not moving all those data in and out of an Amazon data center and in and out of an Oracle data center. Those things are going to be tend to be co-located.","So we think we have some built in advantages being a strong player in SaaS and a strong player in PaaS and making it very \u2013 all of the customers who want to get their infrastructure as a service or their related infrastructure as a service from the same cloud supplier in the same data center.","Mark Moerdler","Okay, I really appreciate.","Lawrence Ellison","Okay.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Thank you very much. Safra, you mentioned growth in operating income in your prepared remarks. I was wondering if you can help us think about how that translates into growth in operating margins?","Safra Catz","We expect operating margins to go up also as this continues. Obviously, cloud margins are going to the roof that\u2019s become obvious, and we expect operating margins to increase. So you\u2019ve got revenue increasing and operating margins also increasing over time and operating income increasing also over time.","So we\u2019re very \u2013 this is actually a very, very important time for Oracle financially, because what you see is that, we\u2019ve stopped having reductions in really in any of the numbers and we\u2019ve turned up in every way, including EPS. And I know for a while I was telling you, this is a transition and all that. But we feel like we\u2019re officially at the complete end of the beginning. Meaning, we\u2019re now in the mode of increasing improving EPS up, operating income up, revenue up everything we\u2019ve made the transition and we are moving up from here.","Mark Hurd","I\u2019d like to comment something in terms of margins. Our generation two of our data center, okay, what was wrong with generation 1, no one asked. Generation one was more expensive than we liked it. One of the great things about our Gen 2 data center is, we think we now have the best bang for the buck, the best class performance data centers in the world with our Gen 2 data centers.","We think we, again, we deliver more performance and cost of any cloud provider, we think that\u2019s another huge advantage for us. And we\u2019ll be scaling our business on this new very, very cost effective most modern of all the cloud networks that\u2019s going to help our margins enormously.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan","Hey, Oracle team congratulations on the results as well. Mark, I guess, two sub-part questions for you try to keep it brief. One is, how would you explain the magnitude of outperformance on the SaaS and PaaS revenue growth relative to the midpoint of the guidance, wondering if the milestone criteria are turning out to be faster than you expected, or maybe that\u2019s not the case?","And secondly, as you look at your SaaS and PaaS revenues, there are a large number, and I\u2019m curious and also get questions from Investors as to what exactly is the relative size or magnitude of growth rates of the categories vis-\u00e0-vis HCM, ERP and CRM, digital marketing, any color you can give us there that would be fantastic? Thank you.","Mark Hurd","Sure. First, there\u2019s no one reason why we beat the revenue. It\u2019s a magnet, it\u2019s all of the reasons. I mean, first starts with, we booked more than we planned sort of point one and we not only booked more, we booked more faster than we thought. So it would improve our linearity as we \u2013 our team has done a great job in cloud from a provisioning perspective. Provisioning meaning, we then sell more \u2013 we sell more faster and then we actually get the customer up and running and live and that has another effect done on revenue linearity.","In addition, as I mentioned, our renewals were 200 basis points over prior year and not to say, it was better than we expected, but it was good, it was solid and that helped as well. Then we also had more usage on our platform. And so we\u2019ve had this continued sort of not linear, but geometric increase in the usage of our PaaS platform. So those that are not on subscription, but on here just use more. And so when you sort of add up all of those things and no one thing was 80% of its cash, it was really all of those things together added up to the beat that you referenced.","Your second question was the relative growth rates to various businesses. I\u2019ll start with there\u2019s sort of all good. It would be the way I would describe it, and the question becomes degree of good. I gave you a number specifically on ERP in terms of growth rate, and that number, I think, I gave it to your quarter-on-quarter in terms of growth rate.","Do you know, what I\u2019ll do? As we get towards financial analyst day, I\u2019ll do more of a break-out pillar by pillar, but they\u2019re just all \u2013 I mean, our performance in marketing, our performance in HCM. In the HCM, I can\u2019t help myself here. On HCM, the performance of our team on HCM was just superb, and I mean that\u2019s a global statement Kash.","I mean, if we went back to the days of four or five year ago, it\u2019s just amazing, totally what our product team has done, our ability to release new product, our ability to get it to market, the references we\u2019ve gotten, I mean, we get almost 1,000 new HCM customers this year. 2.5 times the guide we were talking about three or four year ago. I mean it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s still \u2013 it\u2019s just \u2013 it was just a superb quarter for us by pillar. And I think to be honest with you, Kash, I think based on what I told you in my prepared remarks on the pipeline, I think it\u2019s going to get better.","Kash Rangan","Great to hear that. Congrats again.","Mark Hurd","Thanks, Kash.","Ken Bond","Next question operator?","Operator","Your next question again will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies & Company.","John DiFucci","Thank you. I have a question about the database. You announced R2 of 12c back in Oracle open world, and I believe there was a webcast schedule that was postponed or you were supposed to do earlier this month on the database? I realize you can\u2019t talk about the timing of general availability of R2, but can you talk about, I don\u2019t know generally anecdotes about earlier adopters for R2? And then also your expectations of how this will be consumed by customers between license and cloud consumption, because that help with us regardless of how we think of it, how we\u2019re going to model it? Thanks.","Mark Hurd","As you know, R2, a lot of people don\u2019t migrate to the DOT1 releases of our DOT1 \u2013 DOT1 releases of our database. They wait for the DOT2 release. So that it is completely stable. We have two key features in version 12 of our database. One is in memory, the other is multi-tenancy, both of those are in high demand. I think it\u2019s made in version 12 of our database, one of the most rapidly adopted versions in many, many years.","The question is what will that adoption look like? I think, you\u2019ll see early adoption in the cloud. I think, cloud is going to lead the adoption. So we now have hybrid customer. Typical customer might have said, okay, I\u2019d like to experimenting with release 12 and I\u2019m going to put it on these product development computers over here.","Well, we\u2019re encouraging our customers to look an alternative. Why don\u2019t you just use the latest version in the cloud, and why don\u2019t you do your experimentation and your testing and your application migration to \u2013 and your upgrades in the cloud. It\u2019s going to save you some money, and allow you to get access even faster. And we think that what\u2019s going to happen.","We\u2019re also offering a version of our cloud hardware, our hardware configurations that it\u2019s while \u2013 because it\u2019s for statutory reasons on a bank and for statutory reasons, I really have a hard time moving this application into cloud, no problem. We\u2019ll take our existing cloud or cloud hardware, the exact same configuration, we will move it behind your firewall, and we\u2019ll let you \u2013 and we\u2019ll completely manage it for you behind your firewall.","You\u2019ll buy it just like it\u2019s cloud, in other words, you won\u2019t buy the hardware. There will no upfront cost for the hardware. There\u2019s no upfront cost for the software. It will look exactly like the Oracle Cloud. It\u2019s just the boxes will happen to be sitting on your data center floor behind your firewall.","So we\u2019re getting people more options to go to the cloud, making it easier for them to go to the cloud, because when our customers go to cloud, which is what we want them to do, and we want them to go earlier and we \u2013 and other opportunity to get them to move to the cloud as \u2013 with accelerated adoption of 12 DOT2 of our database. That\u2019s how we would like them to consume it.","If they go to the cloud, they save money and it\u2019s easier for them and we make more money and it\u2019s better for us. So that\u2019s will be pushing our people. So, again, we\u2019re incented and the customer is incented to get to the cloud as quickly as we can. How fast can we make that happen? We made it happen pretty fast in Q4, and we\u2019re going to keep pushing this fiscal year.","John DiFucci","Thanks, Larry. That\u2019s helpful, but just one clarification. When you talk about cloud hardware configurations On-Premise, are you alluding to Exadata, is that what you\u2019re talking about, especially for the database?","Lawrence Ellison","Actually, it\u2019s very great. I\u2019m glad you asked the question, not just Exadata. So no, it would be our infrastructure as a service configuration and our Exadata configuration together, which is PaaS. So Exadata is really PaaS, it\u2019s just database as a service is what Exadata is, one we install it as part of the cloud that we manage it for you.","So we have a separate box, where you\u2019re running compute and block storage and all of our other cloud services. We basically, it\u2019s like we to open another \u2013 cloud datacenter. Imagine, we open another cloud data center at JPMorgan Chase. I\u2019m not picking on my poor friend Jamie Dimon, but that\u2019s my knowledge. We don\u2019t have a deal to do that at JPMorgan Chase.","But anyway, but let\u2019s say they \u2013 I\u2019m comfortable, they got certain statutes and regulators wanted to do this behind their firewall. They\u2019re uncomfortable putting in the public cloud. We would actually create a little mini-version of our cloud datacenter on the JPMorgan Chase floor. We would manage it for. They would not buy the hardware. They would not buy the software. They would just buy a cloud subscription, just like it\u2019s in our cloud.","It\u2019s just so happens, we would locate that hardware, which we would manage. We would locate that hardware on their floor behind their firewall for more security. But it was just, again, it would be hard \u2013 it will manage as part of the Oracle public cloud. The hardware identical. The software is identical to the Oracle public cloud. We\u2019re just allowing our customers back option. We\u2019re trying to make it easier for them and give them more options to get to the Oracle public cloud, even if you\u2019re a highly regulated bank.","John DiFucci","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Philip Winslow, Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow","Hey, thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter, particularly on the cloud and the customer count number on the database with service side, it was quite impressive particularly. Question for Mark, there has been a lot of discussion out there, the rumors just in the market about your changes to the comp plan or the Salesforce focusing on cloud, not licensing and then others saying that you\u2019re dropping the cloud your compensation structure. So, wondering if you could just comment on if there are any changes to comp program to structure the Salesforce or kind of what they\u2019re focused on this fiscal year? That would be great.","Mark Hurd","Sure. There \u2013 really is no change to the \u201cstructure\u201d when you throw that in. So we are actually quite happy with our structure in that context. Now we\u2019ve actually cleaned up a few things. So I\u2019ve made some changes three or four years ago to, which group called on what and there were some things that we\u2019ve done that are \u2013 I would describe them as de minimis in terms of changes, but who calls on what size of account et cetera. So there\u2019s a little bit of that, but frankly not much else.","We have made an investment, so as I know you know in what we call Oracle Direct. This is selling really a lot of inside sales with a little bit of outside sales that supplement it and we continue to raise the bar for those things. It is a lower cost of sales. It\u2019s a much modern \u2013 more modern way of selling and these are primary vehicle into what you would think of as SMB.","And we continued to expand their use, expand the amount of headcount, invest in tools, we talked last \u2013 I think last quarter about investment we made in Austin, the CapEx we spent to build out that very modern center. So think of more of that Phil, more people, more support for that team and they\u2019re actually calling higher in terms of the size of accounts so they call, it very effective for us, more people. But when you look at our spending, our spending actually doesn\u2019t go up nearly as much as the amount of resource that we get as part of those investments.","In terms of the comp plan itself, there is no decrease in cloud comp. That\u2019s just pure nonsense of anything. We believe we pay to all salespeople that would like to make money. You sell cloud at Oracle, you will make more money than anywhere else in the industry and that\u2019s our model and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.","In terms of On-Prem comp in just application, these are applications that are not our GBU applications. So think of them as our horizontal applications. We now do not retire quota for a license sale. We retire quota just on cloud. They do receive some \u201ccomp\u201d in the context as it relates to a license sale.","But Phil, to understand today in horizontal as licenses, the vast majority of all of our licenses are in ERP. And the vast majority of those are add-on seats within ERP, into our existing base more users. And then within that, we put a special team in place that actually focuses on handling that within our user base. So I understand there\u2019s some noise about it, but I would describe this as a non-event.","Philip Winslow","Great, thanks for your clarification.","Mark Hurd","By the way, I want to add \u2013 because I just can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t help myself. But as of today, we have all of our sales people who have a territory, they have a comp plan, they have a boss and virtually all of our salespeople, since the end of the year, I want to make sure I say this, since the end of our fiscal year have today been trained on all of our newest offerings.","So I have had this goal, Larry and I talked about this for years that we would get to the point that by the time we would start a year, instead of it taking forever. By the way, most companies take a quarter, four months, five months to get all this done.","Our objective has been that sales people leave the fiscal year on May 31 that as soon as possible, they get out of the year, they have a quota, they have a comp plan, they have a boss, they have a territory and they\u2019ve been trained on everything we\u2019ve got. And I can tell you as we sit here today, that is almost entirely complete for the entire Oracle Corporation.","Philip Winslow","Thanks guys.","Mark Hurd","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow","Hey, thanks for taking my question. And I want to move up a little bit and talk about geographies on two aspects. First of all, Mark, can you talk a little bit about the success you have in cloud in the different regions. And then secondly more bigger picture is \u2013 obviously worries about end demand et cetera in the different regions and maybe you can comment on what you\u2019re seeing out there in the field in general for the whole business? Thank you.","Mark Hurd","I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve missed one word. Did you say, end demand?","Raimo Lenschow","Yes.","Mark Hurd","Okay. By region, I think our performance in Asia Pacific was superb. Now that comes from where we\u2019ve been over the past couple of years, but I don\u2019t know that I would describe that as a market phenomena, I\u2019m just going to make my comments in the context of Oracle. I think our team in Asia, which we\u2019ve recruited over the past 18 months did a superb job all through the year. I think it culminated in a very strong quarter. We saw very strong growth really across every line.","I mean, license performance was quite strong. Both SaaS and PaaS growth rates were superb, so very positive on Asia. I feel the same way in Europe. I mean, there\u2019s mixed economy over in Europe. We don\u2019t actually talk about it much around here, because I think our performance in Europe has been consistent over the years. I think our performance was emblematic of that through the fiscal year and was good and solid in Q4.","So I feel very good about it. I think that\u2019s the way I would describe things outside the U.S. LAD. We continue to deal with all the issues in Brazil. I would say within the context of overall LAD relative to the market, because our team performed fantastic. Our movement of the cloud in LAD is perhaps as fast as anything we have across our company. So \u2013 and then you get to the U.S. and I think in applications our move to the U.S. was the quickest, the fastest, and shows up in the majority of these wins that I talked about are in the U.S. I mean, there\u2019s some very exciting movements. Our business in applications in the U.S. is a cloud business, it is not a license business, it is a cloud business.","North America Tech has been strong in terms of its PaaS bookings \u2013 platform bookings. And I would say I\u2019d also like to throw in our GBUs. I have to mention the strength of their performance in cloud. The growth rate in our GBUs was superb, led by both our retail business, our hospitality business, and our health sciences GBU. They had a great win at Pfizer in the quarter and they have really kicked their competitor metadata pretty strong over the course of the year, and I\u2019d like to probably give them the credit for that, they\u2019ve done a great, great job. So maybe more data than you wanted, but that\u2019s my view going across the globe.","Raimo Lenschow","Perfect. Very helpful. Thank you.","Mark Hurd","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Bradley Reback with Stifel.","Bradley Reback","Hey, thanks very much. Safra, could you maybe give us some sense of what the CapEx requirements for the business should be here in 2017? Thanks.","Safra Catz","So, overall CapEx should be a little bit more than it is this year very little bit more. And all of that would be actually from the real estate on our real estate side as we build out our campus in Texas. And also we have a little bit more real estate around the country on the cloud CapEx, which is the one I think you* guys have really been focusing on.","As you know, in FY 2015, it was quite high. It dropped really dramatically like 30% this past year, and it will go up a little bit, but not anywhere near where it was in FY 2016. So I think, generally, it\u2019s going to be around where it is right now. And any increases are entirely as a result of just some real estate thing that will benefit us for decade really as we purchase pieces of property stuff like that.","Mark Hurd","To Safra\u2019s point, our cost per seat or a sales rep is declining. So our cost of housing them are countless that we have to make these CapEx investments, but salary, bonus everything as we move with such into this modern selling effort. We have more people, but our cost per seat is actually declining.","Safra Catz","Okay.","Bradley Reback","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our final question for today will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much. Mark, just given the new customer count in cloud and seen you\u2019re picking up some momentum in the mid-market, especially around ERP. Can you just discuss what\u2019s driving that? Is it just more focus in \u2013 from a sales standpoint? Is it having sort of our suite offering versus just our best-of-breed products? Just any color on that would be helpful. Thanks.","Mark Hurd","Yes, Kirk, I just think it\u2019s all of the stuff. I mean, I think listen, I mean, you can\u2019t start with the fact that we have good products, and we have good products that\u2019s a really big advantage. So that\u2019s sort of point one. Point two, we\u2019ve done a lot of training in our salespeople are frankly better and they come in* with good products. They now know a lot more about them and we have references, and when you have those sort of combinations, things go well for you. I think we\u2019ve done a good job, putting our people set this point about the investments we\u2019re making. We put our people in these new modern capabilities that are given them great tools now* go to market.","Now let me say all this against the backdrop of \u2013 I think we\u2019re actually going to get better of this. So I think when you look at our \u2013 you can\u2019t look at them, I can. But when I look at our pipelines, I remember two years ago, I made the statements that I thought our ARR would be good a couple of year ago and lot of people said why?* And it is because our pipeline was up and I can see it mature to the pipeline. This pipeline we have now is the strongest best pipeline we\u2019ve had. And I believe our conversion rate meaning the movement of that pipeline into actually booked orders will actually get better for the very reasons we\u2019re* describing, so I\u2019m \u2013 quite optimistic about it.","Kirk Materne","Thanks.","Ken Bond","Thank you, mark.

These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today.","As a result, we caution you from placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q, and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.","And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.","Before taking questions, we will begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we've made some significant changes in our financial reporting and in our guidance to match our company's fundamental transition. We're now firmly into the transition to the cloud and we had previously disclosed our SaaS revenues in the 10-Ks and Qs. As the cloud revenue has become larger and more significant, we've gone ahead and disclosed some on the phase of our income statement.","You may want to actually take out your income statement as we go through this, just so that you can follow me. What we previously reported as new software license and cloud subscription is now reported on two separate lines; new software license and another line for cloud Software-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service, SaaS and PaaS.","At this time, the bulk of the revenue is Software-as-a-Service. Well, we expect Platform-as-a-Service to become very important as we do the full launch of Platform-as-a-Service this fall. Also, we previously reporting in service what we previously reported in services is now reported on two separate lines, cloud Infrastructure-as a-Service, IaaS and services.","We have some new software license SaaS and PaaS, IaaS and software license update and product support as a total called software and cloud revenue. Our services line now includes consulting, advanced customer support services and education. The expense lines were also broken out in more details, where appropriate.","So to start, I'm going to go over the Q4 results with our new detail, and then sum it up using our old disclosure for comparability to my previous guidance. Then I'll move on to the guidance for Q1. Generally, I'll be using non-GAAP measures in constant currency unless otherwise stated, but we'll point out GAAP numbers or U.S. dollar growth rate when the difference is important for comparability to last year.","So using our new reporting, software and cloud revenue totaled a record 8.9 billion in Q4, growing 4%. New software license was 3.8 billion flat in U.S. dollars, declining 1% in constant currency, while new software license application revenues were up 6%.","Cloud SaaS and PaaS were 327 million, growing 23%. Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service was 128 million, growing 13%. Software license updates and product support was 4.7 billion, growing 6% in constant currency and 7% in U.S. dollar. Software supported cash and renewal rate were strong as usual.","To most closely compare these numbers to my guidance last earnings call, new software license and cloud SaaS and PaaS added together were 4.1 billion, up 1% in constant currency and 2% in U.S. dollars. With our new presentation, you can see that our on-premise based software business, which is new software license and software license update and product support has steadily grown over time to 8.5 billion this quarter.","On top of that, we're building our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS cloud business, which grew nearly 20% and is already approaching a $2 billion run rate with 455 million in revenues this quarter. Hardware system revenue was nearly 1.5 billion growing 3% on a GAAP basis and 2% on a non-GAAP basis. Hardware products were 870 million, growing 3%, and hardware support was nearly 600 million, growing 2%. ","Engineered systems had another good quarter with double-digit growth and represent 1\/3rd of hardware product sales. In addition, we saw very strong growth in NAS storage in the quarter.","Hardware product gross margins were 49%, down about two points from last year as we continue to put more value in our products without raising prices that's grabbing significant market share as all our major competitors shrink. Keep in mind that as we've increased hardware supported tax rates, hardware support margin has steadily improved and total hardware systems margin are unchanged from last year at 66%.","For the company, total revenue for the quarter was 11.3 billion, up 3% from last year. Operating income was 5.8 billion, up 2% in constant currency, 3% in U.S. dollars, operating margin was 51%, same as last year. Unlike new software license transactions where we've recognized the revenue upfront, we've recognized the revenue from cloud software over time. In the short-term -- in the short run it delays revenue, but over the medium and long-term, we can expect more revenues as we do more of the work for our customers, while our customers can expect to pay substantially less than total with savings in the form of large reductions in the cost of implementing and running their own system.","Over time, this contributes to our business model, particularly given our differentiated product in each of SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. ","As we get to the operating income line, I want to remind you that our GAAP operating income last year benefited from a $269 million reduction in the purchase price of an acquisition. This was entirely excluded from a non-GAAP purpose, but did show up in our GAAP -- in the GAAP numbers, which flow all the way through.","In addition, both on GAAP and non-GAAP results include another foreign currency loss this quarter, this time for $102 million from the devaluation of our Venezuela net assets, compared to the dollar. This of course was not included in my guidance last quarter.","Our net asset values in Venezuela have now devalued so much that it will not have any meaningful impact on our numbers going forward. Were it not for the Venezuela currency loss, EPS would have been $0.02 higher.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23%, the GAAP tax rate was 20.5. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.92, up from $0.87 last year. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.80, unchanged because last year our GAAP EPS was helped by the $0.04 reduction in the purchase price for the acquisition I just mentioned.","I want to make sure I said that correctly, so you understand what happened. We got a $0.04 benefit last year in our GAAP EPS. This year we obviously don't have that benefit, and without that benefit it would have been $0.76, not $0.80.","Operating cash flow increased 14.9 billion, and free cash flow grew to 14.3 billion over the last four quarters, both a record Q4 results. For the fiscal year 2014, total software and cloud revenues totaled a record 29.2 billion, growing 5% in constant currency. New software license was 9.4 billion, up 1%.","Cloud SaaS and PaaS were 1.1 billion, growing 20% non-GAAP and 24% GAAP. Cloud infrastructure to service was 456 million, growing 1%. Software support was 18.2 billion, growing 7%. Hardware system revenue was nearly 5.4 billion, growing 2%. Of that, hardware products were 3 billion, down 1% for the year, and hardware support was 2.4 billion, growing 5% for the year. Services revenue was 3.7 billion, declining 4% as a result of the continuing move of our consulting business to shorter, faster, cheaper engagements for our customers as they move to the cloud.","Total revenue grew 4% to a record $38.3 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margins for the full year was 47%. Earnings per share were $2.87, growing 8%. We've successfully grown the company's revenues and earnings through every transition whether it was many computer database to a complete suite of products, client server to Internet, commodity hardware to engineer systems and now on-premise to cloud. We're well on our way into our most recent transition.","We have nearly 39 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is more than 14 billion. Deferred revenue now stands at 7.3 billion, up 2% from last year. In Q4, we repurchased more than 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion, and for the full year we repurchased nearly 281 million shares for a total of more than 9.8 billion, and the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend $0.12 per share between dividend and buyback. This year we returned nearly $12 billion or more than 80% of our free cash flow to our shareholders.","Now, let's move to the guidance. Software and cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis which includes new software license, software support, SaaS and PaaS and IaaS is expected to grow 6% to 8% in U.S. dollars, 5% to 7% in constant currency.","SaaS and PaaS, one of the line items on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 25% to 35% in U.S. dollars, 24% to 34% in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS on a GAAP basis is expected to grow 27% to 37% in U.S. dollars, 26% to 36% in constant currency.","Next, another one at the line, cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 10% to 20% in U.S. dollars and 9% to 19% in constant currency. Hardware system revenues on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes hardware systems products and hardware system support is expected to be between negative one and positive three or negative two to positive two in constant currency.","Total revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 4% to 6% in U.S. dollars and 3% to 5% in constant currency.","Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.62 and $0.66 in U.S. dollars, $0.61 and $0.65 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.49 and $0.53 in U.S. dollars and $0.48 to $0.52 in constant currency. Now, this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 22% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. Of course it may end up being different and with that I'll turn it over to Larry.","Larry Ellison","Thank you, Safra. Okay. Oracle is focused, focused like a laser on one goal over the next few years, becoming the number one company in cloud computing\u2019s two most profitable segments, Software-as-a-Service, SaaS; and Platform-as-a-Service, PaaS. We expect to become number one for three reasons. First, we have the most complete and modern portfolio of SaaS products in the cloud. CRM sales, CRM service, marketing; in human capital management, we have core human resources, recruiting, talent management and payroll. In ERP we have accounting, procurement, supply chain, project management and more, the most comprehensive suite of products in the cloud by far.","Second, all of those SaaS applications run on the world's most powerful platform in the cloud, the Oracle in-memory, multi-tenant database and the world's most popular programming language, Java.","Third, we have dramatically expanded, specialized and lined up our sales forces to sell SaaS and PaaS subscriptions against the new generation of cloud software competitors and it\u2019s working. As we enter our new fiscal year, we are already number two in overall SaaS subscription sale. In FY '15 our plan is to grow our SaaS bookings over 50%. That will allow us to close in on the number one spot.","We already have a huge lead over Workday in cloud ERP. We acquired 120 new cloud ERP customers in Q4 alone. In HCM, we are dominating Workday in Europe, and beating them in dozens of core HCM deals here in North America.","Walking you through some of the details of highlights regarding our cloud wins and our great Q4 quarter in the cloud - let me just actually start with hardware a little bit. We\u2019re now roughly in the middle of transition in our hardware business, engineered systems strategy are now a significant part of our hardware, we\u2019ve grown hardware for the second quarter in a row. The change in mix away from commodity hardware to high-value engineered systems that transform the business to an integrated engineered systems business that brings with it extremely attractive annuity. Let me give you some facts about hardware.","Engineered systems grew to record levels in Q4 while our competitors as Safra described are declining. We will ship our 10,000 engineered system in Q1; we\u2019re at the scale. Our hardware support margins are now approaching to 70% and this business is sticky. SPARC super cluster bookings grew triple digits, Exalytics, Big Data Appliance and Oracle Database Appliance all grew double-digits.","Oracle has become the hardware company taking share, growing and doing it profitably. And as I said we are in the middle of the transition. ","Now, I will talk about cloud. We are actually just starting this transition. We are the only company that has a whole suite of cloud applications. We are salesforce.com's primary competitor, Workday's primary competitor. And in the cloud we\u2019re many times the size of Workday, we\u2019re bigger than SAP, and we are going to pass Salesforce in cloud.","Let me run a few facts about our cloud. As industry analysts build their waves and quadrants they name cloud leaders in specific cloud areas and Oracle today is the leader across more cloud solutions than Salesforce, Workday and SAP combined. Cloud bookings grew 37% last year. Q4 was the best ever for bookings. Fusion cloud bookings growth was three times the overall growth rate. Fusion HCM, ERP and sales force automation revenue all grew triple-digits.","We added 870 cloud customers in Q4 including in HCM nearly 320 customers, with Fusion 110 HCM customers. If I take Workday's reported number of 75 new customers, we are adding customers at four to five times the pace of Workday. In customer experience we added 430 customers with 120 plus Fusion sales force automation wins. With BlueKai now on board along with Eloqua and Responsys, we are the clear number one in marketing automation with bookings growth of 200% this quarter.","In sales force automation, bookings grew more than 80% and revenue was up triple-digits. As Larry referenced we added 120 ERP cloud customers in the quarter, all Fusion. In just Q4 we added more ERP cloud customers than Workday's total customer base for financials. More than 70 customers go lives just this quarter with hundreds already live. We are about to deliver release 9 of Fusion this summer. With Fusion we have built the most attractive cloud solution in the industry. We have acquired the most attractive SaaS companies in the industry.","We are already number one or number two in every SaaS category and we won't stop until we are number one in every category. Just like hardware where we focused in engineered systems in software we are focused on the cloud. We are executing, we are winning and we are going to be number one. And with that I'll turn it over for questions.","Ken Bond","Before we go to questions, Chelsea, I want to call out that we understand that some of you may have difficulty hearing parts of Mark's comments. So we will continue to move forward with the call and we will try to address some of Mark's comments into the Q&A. Chelsea, if you could start the Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We will go first to Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill \u2013 UBS","Thanks, good afternoon. Safra, just on the revenue recognition changes, I'm just curious if you could walk through why now, and I think you stated in the press release that you're seeing a shift to ratable revenue recognition versus upfront, and if you could maybe just talk through how long you think that will take to accelerate the sales process to align to this new model?","Safra Catz","Okay. So, thanks for the question. Let me clarify my quote. Really we have -- we always, always recognize SaaS and PaaS cloud subscriptions over time. That's always been the way we do it. New licenses, we recognize upfront. We haven't changed any of our actual accounting. What happened is that more of our software revenues are coming in as SaaS subscription, which we recognize over time versus new license deals, which we recognize upfront.","So we haven't actually changed any of our accounting, it's just that with our focus on cloud and the fact that we are selling more cloud, we recognize that ratably over time as appropriate on that contract, and so a bigger piece of software and what we use to call software and cloud subscription -- new software license and cloud subscription, a larger piece of it is recognized over time. Did you understand me or should I try that again?","Brent Thill \u2013 UBS","No, that's great. I guess just from a go-to-market maybe, Mark, just that process of putting that in place. How long does that take to get the sales aligned to that process?","Mark Hurd","Well, -- can you hear me okay now? I just want to make sure; I'm at a different microphone. But when you hire a sales person who is selling cloud, they are really selling ARR, which is Annual Recurring Revenue. Roughly speaking, ARR is a third of a license. It's not precisely right. It differs a little bit by solution, but it roughly right.","So therefore we take roughly three years for somebody to get to the same productivity of what you'd think of in the license model. So that's probably the timeframe you should be thinking of, and it's Larry.","Larry Ellison","Okay. There are two things. There is the rate in which -- This is Larry. The rate at which we recognize revenue, which of course statutorily whenever we sell a cloud subscription whether it's Platform-as-a-Service, Software-as-a-Service, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, you always recognize the revenue ratably by month versus selling a license, you recognize it upfront. That's the accounting. The sales force is motivated by their commissions. And we\u2019ve made it commission neutral. In other words the sales force doesn't really care if they sell a license or they sell a subscription. They get paid the same amount in either case. So the sales force has -- there is no time at all required for the sales force to transition to this new model. They get paid equally for a cloud subscription or a license.","So there is no transition time, it's zero. What is different and what Safra was explaining is that we as our cloud business gets bigger and I think everybody wants our cloud business to get bigger, I certainly do. We actually make more money when we sell a cloud subscription. We breakeven \u2013- a subscription is probably after three years as Mark pointed out. We get about the same amount of money from a subscription after three years as we get from a license. But these subscriptions last three, four or five, 10, 15, 20 years, so we make a lot more money on a subscription, but we recognize the money over time. So as we make the transition to selling more cloud software services as opposed to upfront licenses, we will recognize the cloud revenue over time. And that eventually, that cloud revenue eventually will grow to be even bigger than our license revenue, at least that\u2019s our plan and we will make more money doing that over time.","But during the transition selling those cloud subscriptions what would have been a license is now recognized over time. So we are going to recognize the revenue more slowly. And that will somewhat affect the top line during the transition. That's okay, because in the long-term we make much, much more money. And we can effectively compete against this whole new array of competitors like Salesforce and Workday versus the previous generation of competitors like SAP and IBM.","Brent Thill \u2013 UBS","Very clear, thank you.","Operator","We will move on to Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.","Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank","Hi, thanks. This question is for Safra. Safra, you were able to keep the operating margins flat at about 47% despite among other things, a big 10% growth in sales and marketing in fiscal '14. I just wanted to ask you if you look forward to fiscal '15, do you think that pace of sales investments is likely to moderate and how comfortable are you with Oracle returning to year-over-year margin improvement in this fiscal '15? Thank you.","Safra Catz","Well. I actually expect us to continue to improve over time to be honest with you. The one thing that could maybe impact our margins negatively is if we are like voraciously successful with cloud in the next year or so such that a lot of revenue comes in this cloud even though I don't recognize it upfront. And so we have expenses, some expenses related to that, that are not matched by our other improvements in productivity in the rest of the business. Generally, I think we've got it very, very well balanced and I actually expect our operating margins to improve because we made the big investments in the field already. In most regions the big, big investments have gone in over the past three years and I don't expect them to continue to increase at that rate.","Mark, Larry, do you want to comment on?","Mark Hurd","No. I think well, Safra says it right. We have gone through a sizable build up based on the strategy that we described to you previously. We are still adding. We are not adding at the pace that we were adding. So I think you should expect that Larry talked about pretty exciting opportunity for us in PaaS, the last sales people in the area of PaaS and there will be some complementary areas to the sales force that we've got. But you won't see the size of increases that you have seen over the past two or three years.","Safra Catz","And this could be outweighed by revenue growth and this could be outweighed by revenue growth as well as profitability improvements in the rest of business.","Mark Hurd","It is a reasonable to point to bring up because it sort of relates to that first question that came up that as our sales force now becomes more productive particularly when you see cloud booking. Larry gave you a very important statement about some thoughts about cloud bookings in 2015. As those numbers turned from bookings into revenue, that turns into a very attractive model as it relates to your first question about our operating margins.","Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank","Got it, very helpful.","Operator","Walter Pritchard with Citi has the next question.","Walter Pritchard \u2013 Citi","Hi, Safra. I am wondering if you could talk about -- you gave guidance for license three months ago and you were towards to the low end of that. I wonder if you could help people understand what the source of the deviation was there. You did talk about you are seeing more demand show up in SaaS. Was the total sort of volume or demand you saw from the software perspective SaaS and traditional on-prem license in line of what you expect at the midpoint or is at the low end? Just trying to calibrate versus what you got given all of the moving pieces.","Safra Catz","I think we are doing better in cloud than we expected that has become extremely, extremely popular and as a result we have rest of the growth in new license, we have a lot more in cloud but obviously I am not recognizing all that cloud upfront. In fact some of it especially stepped this actually booked in Q4 is not recognized at all and so it shows up later as you will see we are on projecting cloud growth in the high 20s to 30s in my guidance which is obviously a reflection of what's been going on. Cloud is doing extremely, extremely well and sometimes to the extent, you know the customer's alternative of course would have been to buy a license. And so that's what we are doing. I am actually thrilled that we are where we are in new license considering how much cloud growth we've got.","Walter Pritchard \u2013 Citi","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Kash Rangan with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi; one observation and a question. Observation is, you folks have done a remarkable job growing your earnings through this cloud transition and investing in the sales force which is something that many large cap tech and many large cap software companies are not able to -- that speaks to the power of the model. But my observation was that, Safra, I think you mentioned applications up about 6% or so which is commendable especially given the cloud transition. But any commentary on the technology side of the equation. Did that come in? How did that stay relative to your expectations and how should we think about the 12C cycle is the best of the 12C cycle yet to come especially with the multi-tenant option and the in memory option. Just trying to get a gauge whether there was any transition issue involved in the quarter on the tech side. Thank you very much.","Safra Catz","Actually, it's a good question. I am going to get Mark and Larry talk about the new products in the database. But actually what went down in this quarter was a incredibly difficult compare in technology over Q4 last year actually. So I am actually very satisfied with where we came out on the tech side, happy with the app side and overall, extremely happy about what's going on in cloud for us.","Mark Hurd","In the comparison we did a huge deal. Salesforce.com is entirely based on the Oracle database and Oracle technology and in Q4 last year of course they decided to standardize for the next 10 years, actually more precise in the next nine years on the Oracle database and we had a very large deal with Salesforce.com which created a bit of a difficult compare for us this year in the tech portion of our business.","Safra Catz","With that our new products, Larry, just did launch last week.","Larry Ellison","Yes. In term of 12C clearly the 12C is brand new. We think the multi-tenant option and the in memory option are very, very attractive especially to cloud companies. Most of the cloud companies are based on the Oracle database. We are, for example, this last Q4 we did a huge -- a big deal with SAP was success factors is based entirely on Oracle. So people are using the Oracle database in the cloud. So we had a nice deal with them. We had a nice deal a year ago, nice deal with Salesforce.com, obviously net suite at abate. But virtually everybody with the exception of Workdays based on the Oracle database. And we think these two features the in-memory feature and the multi-tenant feature really will allow us to deliver by far the best database experience in the cloud. And that should drive our database sales for the next few years.","Mark Hurd","Okay. Just a little bit of color for you on the database number. First, database to Larry's point was a tough compare in the U.S., but in Europe we grew double-digits. So we had very strong database growth in Europe and so really was that one compare that Larry has described. Middleware had growth in the quarter as well which was good to see. And of course as Safra mentioned our apps business, I mean sort of enjoyed the benefit the other way, about 6% growth in apps and just to get context Kash, I want to emphasize that we had 6% growth in apps license. Sometimes we have on premise at the same time as we had the bookings growth that I referenced which was [37%] (ph) for the year in cloud bookings and it becomes so popular here. So we actually got both benefits in the quarter, so a strong quarter for us.","Operator","Moving on to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo","Hey, good afternoon, guys. I actually have a couple of questions on just cloud and applications overall, maybe first Larry. Which product areas are you seeing best traction, fastest growth? And then the second part maybe Mark, can you maybe breakdown adoption by region because the U.S. look like it was a little slower compared to EMEA and I am trying to figure out if that's a reflection of perhaps greater cloud growth or adoption in the U.S. relative to Europe and on premise licensing. Thanks.","Larry Ellison","I think we are recognized clearly as the leader in marketing and of course our marketing suite Gartner recognizes that as the leader in marketing in the cloud, we are the upper right hand company. And we had great growth in marketing and we are getting traction both in B to C, and B to B end marketing doing very, very well. HCM, kind of across board we are doing extremely well from core HCM to recruiting in talent. We've just been very, very successful in HCM. Its early days in ERP, however, Q4 was a great ERP, Fusion ERP. And this is all the stuff that we built. This is all Fusion, it took us eight, nine, ten years, whatever you want, although I didn't logged on to build on next generation cloud products, Fusion ERP, Fusion HCM, Fusion CRM. It was the top road. But we are beginning to get really serious traction especially in North America for ERP.","Our HCM products are doing extremely well in North America. We were head-to-head against Workday. And we are running the table in EMEA and HCM. We really are the dominant supplier in the cloud in EMEA. In terms of the adoption rates, I mean obviously cloud is much slower to be adopted in Asia-Pac. I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark Hurd","I think, Jason, a couple of points. One, HCM, I think we are doing really well. I mean I know nobody loves it when I read all names, but to be very blunt, our wins in the quarter were significant, just a couple, Cox Enterprises, ITEN, Fair Isaac, National Instruments, Vivendi, Xerox, Fairmont Hotel, these are just a few of the quality brands we took down in HCM alone.","So we had a strong HCM quarter. We were actually going up against a strongest HCM compare last year that we've seen, but it was very, very impressive. So I think we have a position in HCM, where we're battling out with Workday. We think we're winning a lot more than we're losing, and we're doing really well internationally, particularly in Europe as Larry described.","Marketing, we won Kaiser, ITEN, Lexmark, Panasonic, Thomson Reuters, Time Warner Cable, Ricoh, I mean these are quality names that have adopted the Oracle marketing. And I could go on across all these areas. So as I described in my prepared comments that maybe you couldn't hear, when you look at these Gartner waves or Gartner Quadrant (indiscernible) and Forrester waves, we lead in more of these waves and quadrants than our three cloud competitors combined. So I really feel very good about where we are now. And your question about regions, I think you're taking the long conclusion out of Europe versus United States. Our U.S. cloud business has done very well. You don't see it reflected in the numbers quite as well, because of the conversation we had a couple of questions ago about the recognition of subscription revenue, but the bookings in the United States are quite strong.","Our relative position in Europe maybe stronger, but the adoption is slower relative to what we've seen in the U.S. Europe has done fantastic. Let me take nothing away from Europe. But where you're really seeing them done a great job up is winning what's available in the European market, and they've done a great job in our traditional business at the same time.","Operator","We'll now hear from Richard Sherlund with Nomura Securities.","Richard Sherlund - Nomura","Thank you. I just want to follow-up on 12c. Larry, would you envision what the capabilities of 12c that your SaaS partners that use Oracle will re-architect their products to support multi-tenancy at the database level and take advantage in memory capabilities as well to advance the apps offered on top of 12c?","Larry Ellison","Well, if you've already put multi-tenancy, let me answer your re-architecture question, what the 12c database does, the multi-tenant feature takes an existing application that doesn't have multi-tenancy build into it at the application layer and make those existing applications all multi-tenant.","So there are a lot of companies that want to get to the cloud. I mean I'm going just take out of thin air Cerner, who really don't have multi-tenant products, but would like to get to the cloud. They'd be a perfect example of the company who runs on top or Oracle that would like to get to the cloud where the Oracle multi-tenant database gives them fast track to the cloud, and fast track of -- very fast big data analytics with our in-memory options. So those two things I think will be instrumental get us moving our huge ISD community for the cloud on top of our platform. We think that's a gigantic opportunity, and let me emphasize, Salesforce is really two businesses, Salesforce.com; they're leader in the cloud. They have two businesses. They have got there Salesforce automation business, which is most of their application business. And then they have got what they now call Salesforce 1, which is their platform business.","Our platform business is made up of the Oracle database with multi-tenants, in-memory and the world's most popular programming language, Java. We have virtually every ISD runs on top of the Oracle database. Virtually all of these companies would like to be able to move their offerings to the cloud. We now enabled that. Our platform is just coming out this fall. This is a net new business for us going forward, moving all these ISDs into the cloud. We think this might be the biggest single -- in an opportunity-rich world as we're seeing our SaaS applications, the growth is accelerating. We're growing much faster.","So this year, 50% bookings I mentioned before, we're seeing the demand for our SaaS applications accelerate absolutely. And having a broad portfolio gives us a lot of room to grow. PaaS is this new opportunity, where a bunch of companies are just chomping at the bit to get their businesses to the cloud. We can move that ISD community to cloud with 12c. We think that's a gigantic opportunity. And it's going to help us grow our Saas Paas business and make us number one in both categories.","Richard Sherlund - Nomura","Is the in-memory piece as important as the multi-tenancy?","Larry Ellison","Well, it's different pieces, right? I mean the multi-tenancy piece basically let you get to the cloud period with multi-tenancy. And the in-memory piece allows you to offer big data analytics. And what you're asking me, which is more important, big data analytics or multi-tenancy in the cloud, I think they're both crucial to modern computing. These are two of the biggest, biggest parts of modern computing. People spend a lot of time talking about the cloud and getting to the cloud, getting your business to the cloud and modernizing it. And big data analytics, I mean they're number one and number two in the conversation about technology these days in all of the meeting I've been.","Operator","Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs has the next question.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you so much. As Oracle continues with its success in the cloud, over time -- I know you mentioned the revenue benefits over time, but I'm wondering how we think about the long-term operating margin profile of the company as you guys continue down the path of your success? And then also just a follow-up for Mark; knowing you had a tough comp in the U.S. with the Salesforce.com deal in the Americas, was there anything else impacting growth in the region, in the quarter and on the flipside, you had one of the best growth rates we've seen out of you guys in EMEA in quite some time, is there anything there that you can highlight?","Safra Catz","Why don't you take the question first? And then I'll move in.","Mark Hurd","In the U.S., no, everything roughly behaved as we expected. That's the issue on the comp. Europe, I've said this I know multiple times on these calls, they just executed marvelously. They've taken enormous amounts of market share. They have just done a great job, and it's across, Heather, really all aspects of our business. It's across our engineered systems business, our database business, our middleware business, our SaaS business. They were the first to add sales capacity.","They had a sales capacity really three and a half years ago, and they've trained and assimilated that capacity, and that capacity has now got us in materially more deals. Simultaneously, we've been able to take some very strategic transactions as we did this quarter that are just part of that overall series of success as we've seen out of Europe. And I think as you know, Europe hasn't been the most robust economy over the course of that timeframe. So I think our team there has just executed marvelously.","Safra Catz","Heather, on your margin question, as you can see in the numbers and they basically speak for themselves. We've been doing this buildup and investment all within our profitability envelope. You can look at our cash flow statements. You can see our capital investments. We're incredibly advantaged because we make virtually absolutely everything in the cloud that we need, whether it's the hardware, engineered system, the software, the operating system, the database, we have it all. And we have a business that is at such scale that we have enormous economies of scale.","We can add customers at an extremely high profitability level, because we have so many customers generally. And additionally because we control literally so much of our own supply chain, so we can deliver these services and we already have the sales force, we have everything in place. And we are not even at scale in cloud. So imagine at scale what's going to happen here, and as these new bookings which in this heavy growth period actually start to rain back as revenue, we're extremely optimistic about our ability to grow cloud. And over time, as I said in my prepared remarks, in the short-term less revenue come in. In the long-term and medium-term, more revenue come in. And simultaneously, our customers spend and save an enormous amount of money themselves. So it's really a win\/win as well for both of us.","Mark Hurd","Let me just add \u2026 ","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Larry Ellison","Let me just add one little piece, which is the two parts of the cloud business that we're focused on are SaaS, the applications and PaaS, the platform database and Java programming language. We think inherently those businesses are 40%-50% margin businesses. We think that's not the case in Infrastructure-as-a-Service business. We think that's a lower margin business, but we think we can run it profitably in association with our SaaS and PaaS businesses.","Where we're really trying to grow the business, where we're determined to be number one is in SaaS and PaaS. We're in infrastructure of service as a convenience to our customers, who want to have one stop shopping and buy their applications platform and infrastructure at the same place. But we think collectively, those three businesses, as Safra said we're our supply chain. So we buy electricity in buildings; everything else we make. And we think we can deliver the cloud services without compromising our margins whatsoever.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Operator","And our last question will come from Joel Fishbein with BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Fishbein - BMO Capital Markets","Hi. Mark, I might have missed this, but I just wanted to get some more color on the integrated systems. It looks like the business was a little weaker than we have expected -- I'd love to get some color around that. I might have missed it on your opening comments.","Mark Hurd","You mean engineered systems, correct, Joel?","Joel Fishbein - BMO Capital Markets","Engineered systems, sorry, Mark.","Mark Hurd","Yeah, strong quarter, best quarter we ever had. So, just to be clear, I think I said this in Q3 that Q3 was the best you we ever had except for this Q4 that we're going to have, that we've had, and we beat it in Q4. Now, in Q4 was that same deal that Larry described earlier as a comparison and as Safra mentioned, I think she said in her remarks, but also if she didn't, we have double-digit growth in engineered systems in the quarter. So it was a record for us and very strong. We couldn't grow hardware the way we did without engineered systems having a strong quarter. So we are also excited about that.","Joel Fishbein - BMO Capital Markets","All right. Thanks a lot.","Mark Hurd","Thanks, Joel.","Operator","And Mr. Bond, I'll turn things back to you for closing or additional remarks.","Ken Bond","Thank you, operator.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Holly, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s second quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.","As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today.","As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports on our 10-Q and 10-K and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we will begin with a few prepared remarks.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2, I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q3 and Q4 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.","As you can imagine, we\u2019re very pleased with the quarter. Total revenue exceeded my guidance, driven by the combined strength of our cloud business, as well as better than expected results from the on-premise software business. Earnings per share were also above my guidance coming in $0.04 better than the midpoint of the constant currency range I provided last quarter.","Q2 currency headwinds were mostly as expected around 6% in most categories, including total revenues. However, the currency effect to earnings per share was $0.06, $0.01 more than my guidance. We will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls, so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarter, as well as to reflect how we measure the business.","Considering the progress we\u2019ve made in our transition to the cloud in the subscription business, from now on, I\u2019m going to start with our SaaS and PaaS business. We continue to see excellent momentum there with bookings growth of 75% for this quarter on top of the 147% we reported last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was $487 million, up 38% from last year, 39% in GAAP.","Sequentially, SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 8%, and we expect the sequential growth next quarter will be even higher. The bookings growth that we have been experiencing will now translate into a significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue growth in Q3, where we could hit 50% revenue growth and in Q4 where it should be even higher. You can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue.","SaaS and PaaS billings grew 68% in U.S. dollars this quarter. On top of the 70% growth last quarter, also the gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.1 billion and was up a 135% in U.S. dollar. We\u2019ve put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail. The balance of our cloud revenues come from cloud infrastructure as a service, which was up a 11% to a $165 million. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rates, we expect infrastructure as a service revenue growth, which is currently dominated by our hosting business will be more moderate for now.","Total cloud revenues, which is Saas, PaaS, and IaaS were $652 million, up 30%. As our cloud revenue continues \u2013 as our cloud revenue business continues to scale from the growth we are experiencing, it is beginning to benefit our margin, as I previously predicted. The Q2 gross margins for SaaS and PaaS was 43%, up from 40% last quarter, and we\u2019ll see further improvement in Q3.","I also expect the Q4 exit rate gross margin for Saas and PaaS will be around 55% to 60%, and from there we\u2019ll be targeting 80% in fiscal year 2018. The gross margin in the IaaS business was up slightly to 45%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $195 million, or $251 million lower than Q1. And I expect the cloud-based cloud-related CapEx for the full-year will be lower than last year, as we utilized the investments we have made.","On-premise software revenues, including new software license and software license update and product support was unchanged at $6.4 billion. Software license update and product support revenue was $4.7 billion, up 5% from last year and up 1% sequentially. Attach and renewal rates are running at their usual high level. New software license revenue was $1.7 billion, down from last year, but a bit better than I expected for the quarter.","Over the full-year, I expect we will see modest growth in our on-premise software revenue comprised of continued growth in software support that more than offset declines in new software license.","Finally, total hardware revenue was down 10%, which included a hardware products revenue of $573 million and hardware support revenue of $550 million. Total revenue for the quarter was unchanged at $9 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.7 billion and operating margin was 41%.","I believe this for the fiscal year, we are currently in, we are more than halfway through what will turn out to been the trough year for operating income. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% and the GAAP tax rate was 17.6%, as we saw some one-time non-cash benefit. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.63 in USD and GAAP EPS was $0.51 in USD. As I said earlier, non-GAAP EPS was $0.06 lower, due to currency.","Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $11.3 billion. We now have more than $52 billion in cash and marketable securities, net of debt, our cash position is over $10.4 billion. Short-term deferred revenue balance is $7 billion, up 9% in constant currency. This quarter we repurchased more than 86 million shares for a total of $3.25 billion and over the last four years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 16%.","The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased more than $250 million share for a total of $10.3 billion, and paid out dividends of $2.5 billion for a total that is more than a 110% of our free cash flow. I\u2019d also like to formally welcome Raymond James to Oracle\u2019s Board, she is a great addition.","Now to the guidance. I\u2019m going to give you guidance for Q3 and then some preliminary guidance for Q4. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition and clearly customers are rapidly adopting Oracle. As you know, we\u2019re expecting to see a material second-half acceleration in our SaaS\/PaaS revenue, based on our bookings growth and the expiration of customer promotion. My guidance will reflect this making it easier to see that we are taking share in the industry.","Since we have a clear trend and visibility through the end of our fiscal year, I\u2019m going to give not only Q3 guidance, but also some guidance for Q4. My intention is to share with you what we are seeing in our business now that we have a line of sight to it. All my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. We expect to see continued volatility in exchange rate. I\u2019m going to give you constant currency guidance. But if current exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see currency headwind of 4% on revenue and $0.03 to EPS, which is significantly less than Q2.","So onto guidance. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 49 and 53%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow between 3 to 7%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow 3 to 4%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from zero to positive 3. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example it may be \u2013 it may end up being different, probably better.","Looking further out to Q4, we expect to see continued acceleration in SaaS and PaaS, as well as a return to EPS growth year-over-year. My guidance for Q4 is also in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 69 \u2013 65 and 69%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 1 to 5%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 2 and 4%.","Total revenue growth is expected to range from 1 to 3%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.83 and $0.86, which is a significant increase compared to last year\u2019s $0.78.","As I said before, I believe fiscal year 2016 is a trough year for profitability, as we move to the cloud. As such, I expect to see strong EPS growth in Q1 and beyond. My Q4 EPS guidance assumes the same non-GAAP tax rate as Q3 at 25.5%, but that\u2019s probably too early to get a real beat on.","Finally, SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to improve in both Q3 and Q4 exiting the year between 55% and 60%. I will, of course, revisit Q4 guidance with you as part of the Q3 earnings call.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark for his comments.","Mark Hurd","Thanks much, Safra. So in the spirit of giving you just a blizzard of numbers, I\u2019m going to extend that. Because our strong cloud bookings deferred revenue growth will lead to revenue acceleration in the second-half and next year, we talked about a 38% year-on-year double-digit growth. Our billings grew 68%, and again, this give you a number, Salesforce grew 21% and Workday 41%, we grew 68%.","Bookings $284 in USD. In cloud 75% growth. Let me give you some customer numbers. We added 857 new SaaS customers in the quarter, 720 customer expansions. Our installed base is now over 10,000 customers. Over 3,000 of these are Fusion and almost 50% of our bookings in dollars are now Fusion.","In HCM, we added 211 customers, growing faster than Workday, CX 409 customers. In ERP, we added 311 customers. We are now over 1,500 customers are installed base. 450 are now live, 5X Workdays, 90. ERP and EPM more than half of our Q2 wins did not have Oracle on-premise apps, mean that in one quarter, we sold more net new customers than Workday did in its lifetime.","In PaaS, we added 1,343 new PaaS customers, 4,100 now over the last 12 months. Bookings are 100 million in USD and 75% of what we sold is now subscription, non-metered, 25% metered, our PaaS business is scaling nicely.","Now, I\u2019m going to review a bunch of names. I just want you to get a context for sort of the brands we closed in the quarter. In ERP, Blue Shield of California, DHL, FDIC, McKesson, Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric, [indiscernible], a very large phone company in France, a very large industrial manufacturing company, perhaps the largest in the world with over a $130 billion of revenue.","In HCM, AAA, Allergan, City of Aspen, Crocs, think of many of these now that I\u2019m naming again beats against Workday, Exelon, Kaiser, McGraw Hill, Genesis actually a replacement of Workday, Brocade, More HCM, the United Nations, Stanford University. In CX, AmBev \u2013 CXP and being customer experience, AmBev, Expedia, Halliburton, Lufthansa, Maersk, Motorola Solutions, Sears, Toshiba Mitsubishi and United Airlines. In PaaS, Anthem, IKEA, Kaiser, Kia Motors, Maersk, Qantas, Symantec and Windstream, I could have named a lot more. I just wanted to give you a flavor for what we did in the quarter.","Just to wrap up and connect a few dots for you on the Oracle Saas\/PaaS cloud, we are currently at a $2.6 billion run rate in total cloud revenue. It\u2019s likely our quarterly run rate will exit the year around $3.2 billion, and we\u2019ll grow further after Q1 bookings. We will book roughly a 1.5 \u2013 more than 1.5 million in ARO this fiscal year, 1.5 billion, sorry, thank you, billion. If we continue to book the way we expect, we should see our first $1 billion quarter for SaaS\/PaaS revenue next year.","Gross deferred revenue is now nearly $1.1 billion. That is up 135% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter. Gross margin improved sequentially, as Safra described 40% to 43%. We\u2019re headed to 60%, and then as Safra described on to 80%.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry.","Lawrence Ellison","Thanks, Mark. I don\u2019t have nearly as many numbers. I\u2019m moving right up to 25,000 feet and talk a little bit about strategy. Oracle\u2019s strategy is to differentiate our cloud products from our competitors. In SaaS, we differentiate by delivering the industry\u2019s most complete suite cloud application.","In customer experience, we offer a CX suite made up of sales, service, marketing, e-commerce, and a lot more. In human capital management, we have an HCM suite made up of human resources, recruiting, training and so on. In Enterprise Resource Planning, we are delivering an ERP suite net of a financials, supply chain, manufacturing and all the rest.","Oracle is the first company to mark it a complete cloud ERP suite from mid-size and large enterprises. By pioneering this market, we have become the ERP market leader with over 1,500 cloud ERP customers. Cloud ERP is now our fastest growing SaaS application suite.","In past, we have differentiated by making it effortless for our hundreds of thousands of customers to move their millions of existing Oracle databases and job of programs to our cloud with a push of a button, thereby obtaining the low-cost and ease of use to the cloud without having to sacrifice any performance loss or any securities degradation.","We now have a highly differentiated rapidly growing SaaS and PaaS businesses. This coming year, we will deliver a number of innovations in infrastructure to service as well. We expect that our rapidly growing cloud business will drive Oracle\u2019s overall revenue and overall profit growth for years and years to come.","Mark Hurd","Thank you, Larry. Holly, could we please move to the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Thank you so much. Safra, I had a question for you, just based on yours and Mark\u2019s comments about the $1.5 billion plus in SaaS\/PaaS PaaS bookings this fiscal year. Is it reasonable then to assume that in fiscal 2017 that we should see SaaS\/PaaS revenue growth accelerate versus what you\u2019re guiding too for fiscal 2016? Thank you.","Safra Catz","Yes, Heather, in fact it will accelerate very strongly, it can\u2019t help itself. Our bookings are so strong. We\u2019ve had so many contracts already, and we\u2019ll be recognizing those basically regardless of how bookings go and, of course, as you can see our bookings are also accelerating. So but, yes, we\u2019re going to have a phenomenal as far as 2017 in the cloud business. Thank you.","Mark Hurd","Yes, you know, it has the right from the start it\u2019s going to be strong, because you\u2019re going to wind up with our Q4 at the revenue rate that that we just gave you some guidance on, you have the bookings on top of it. And when you start Q1 and into Q2, you can already do the math on what the comparison is going to look like. So it\u2019s going to be a strong year and particularly strong start.","Heather Bellini","Thank you.","Mark Hurd","Next question please?","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies.","John DiFucci","Hi. Thank you. Safra, it\u2019s nice to see some modest progress in your gross margin goals for the cloud business 43% versus 40% last quarter. But non-GAAP operating margin was at 41% was a little bit low what we were looking for anyway. I guess, can you expand a little bit on the gross margin progress since the end of the year. I mean, this is going to be a steep ramp, and I\u2019m just trying to \u2013 try to figure out how much of this is just based simply on this sort of top line growth you\u2019re going to see as the sales promotions sort of and when you start to see top line grow, that\u2019s going to happen or how much of it, if there\u2019s any just to increase deficiencies as you move along?","And then on the operating margin side, I realize, you don\u2019t hedge the income statement, but was this due like could \u2013 like what would have been the impact on excluding foreign exchange effects?","Safra Catz","So, okay, so let\u2019s backup. It is all. The bulk of the SaaS and PaaS margin improvement is because we\u2019re now recognizing revenues for which a much, much large revenues for which we have already paid for many of the cost. And so we built up an infrastructure that can handle massive amount of usage, significantly more usage, and we have not been able to recognize revenue, because we\u2019re recognizing it ratably. As we scale, this is absolutely an area where it is inevitable that we \u2013 that \u2013 this improves.","In addition, we also have efficiency gains at all times, but that is again because of our larger scale and those are simply current use of scale. But the bulk of it is, we\u2019re starting to be able to recognize revenues for which we have already invested. As how many points, actually the impact on operating income for us was quite significant from a currency point of view. But hold on, I\u2019m doing the math, Q3, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve got to actually do it on our margins. I have to do it while you\u2019re talking, while other people are talking, and then I\u2019ll give you the exact answer at that point how much of it was\u2026","Mark Hurd","Yes, we\u2019ll circle back to later in the call here. Why don\u2019t we go to the next question please?","John DiFucci","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets.","Ross MacMillan","Thanks for taking my question. Mark, I think by my math of cloud bookings are about $475 billion year-to-date. And so the hit to $1.5 billion for the year, $1.5 billion, you need to deliver billionish or so in the second-half. Just how confident are you in that goal? And then related to that, I\u2019m curious on the platform or database as a service, you commented that non-metered was a higher percentage. I was just curious to get a sense of how you see customer usage trending on the database as a service product? Thanks.","Mark Hurd","Okay. Well, let me tell you confident that will be my answer to your question. Our pipeline, I think, I mentioned this at Financial Analyst Day, but I\u2019m going to mention it again. Our pipeline, I can\u2019t come up with a better analytical statement then just huge. And so our pipeline now is multiple billions of dollars, let me give you more color. If I look at the next six months our pipeline of things that are in the next six months funnel, you have a multi-billion dollar funnel and our conversion rate is increased.","So that would tell you. And our business has become skilled enough or just to be clear that, it now is behaving like a large business begins to in terms of the scale of funnel, the pipeline, the discipline we have, the conversion rates we have et cetera. So that would be sort of my view on that on.","On PaaS, we have had a change to your point of going away from metered to subscription of bookings. So the bookings are now the bulk, as I mentioned is a 75% now subscription as opposed to metered. And I would say the usage of our PaaS has increased not significantly, but sort of geometrically, meaning that it\u2019s gone from when we originally started the usage to jumped up over the last four or six months, I\u2019d say to where the usage is extremely hot, extremely high in terms of the increase of our usage. So it\u2019s very exciting both in the bookings, the type of bookings, and the usage that we\u2019re seeing of what\u2019s booked.","Ross MacMillan","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Phil Winslow","Hi, thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter, particularly in the cloud. Mark, you gave some pretty impressive metrics both on the customer account side, obviously in addition to the numbers that we talked about in terms of just cloud billings. But if I focus on the SaaS side in particular here, really just a competitive question here, obviously, you put up some numbers that are sort of multiple times the size of your competitors. When you kind of look application by application, because none of us see every segments are same. Where do you think you\u2019re kind of pulling away from the competition? Where do you \u2013 have you seen sort of the biggest change you think in that position over the past quarter, one, two years, that would be great? Thanks.","Mark Hurd","Well, it\u2019s hard to get, I\u2019m going to make this. This is going to be like the fifth time I\u2019ve said this. But I\u2019m going to try it again that in SaaS overall, we\u2019re just better overall. We have more people. We\u2019re well trained. Our products are matured, and we have a lot of references.","Our position in ERP is just unique. We don\u2019t have a competitor per se. I use these metrics to against Workday just to describe to you how expedientially far ahead of our sort of only person I can think of that\u2019s built the product. Just to be clear in ERP SaaS, I don\u2019t ever \u2013 I\u2019m not trying to say it or might have somebody she knows or Larry might know. So I mean, don\u2019t see SAP. I now in the market a lot. I don\u2019t see him. So I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re working on, but it\u2019s not ERP SaaS.","In HCM, I think, we are continue to just get better and better and better. I mentioned, because I had a blizzard of names that I may have done myself with this service by mentioning so many names. But in the companies we actually replaced Workday. So imagine in a period of time Workday so \u2013 sorry, in HCM, we replaced Workday. So we continue to get better and better and better at HCM, and now we\u2019re beginning to see a lot of deals better where you\u2019re selling ERP and HCM is attached to the ERP sale.","So because of ERP being a \u2013 in many ways a very strategic, very sticky sale, we now see our attach rates moving up and up and up where somebody buys ERP and they buy HCM at the same time. The scale of our Fusion products and the reason I gave you that metric for the first time is it is now a very high, it\u2019s not beginning to become a reasonable percent of our total portfolio versus everything that we\u2019ve got, including marketing, which is having a great run as you know.","But I add to it the fact that now the Fusion products, which are extremely sticky, almost 50% of our total bookings. So, I mean, I could feel like you keep going down these metrics for you. But I think we\u2019re unique in ERP and getting further ahead, I mean, we\u2019re at a point now we have over 1,500 customers, and we\u2019ll give you a prognostication where we end the year. But I \u2013 it\u2019s going to be well over 2,000, I guess, it did. It\u2019s going to be well over 2,000. We\u2019re getting better and better at HCM. We\u2019re in a leadership position in marketing. I feel good about where we sit.","Phil Winslow","Got it. Perfect. Thanks. Congrats, guys.","Mark Hurd","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital.","Raimo Lenschow","Hey, thanks for taking my question. We talked a lot about cloud. But can I talk \u2013 ask about the database business? So 12C is in beta since OpenWorld. Can you talk a little bit about what are you seeing becoming closer to release two now hopefully. What are you seeing out in the market? Thank you.","Mark Hurd","Well, we see our customers with a much higher uptake of 12.2 simply because they have two key features that are very important to our customers. One is the In-Memory aspect of the database, where now have the PaaS\u2019 In-Memory database. And the way you take advantage of that, you take any existing Oracle application and you run it without change on 12.2, and it runs much, much fast \u2013 it runs in memory without changing.","So other people say, we\u2019ll use market in-memory database. We have to rewrite the application. In this case, you don\u2019t have to rewrite the application, you press the button. We run much faster and by the way we went faster in the competition. So we have a lot of our customers wanted to take advantage of in-memory acceleration, that\u2019s one of the reasons they buy the new version of the database.","The other thing is multi-tenancy. They\u2019d like to do a lot of consolidation there, but a lot of small databases. They\u2019d like to run on one machine and you can do that much more efficiently by running the Oracle database with multiple tenants. You consume less hardware resources that\u2019s easier to manage. You can backup a whole suite of databases as a group of databases is one, it\u2019s thoroughly automated. So that\u2019s the other major reason we see a very rapid uptake.","And finally, we\u2019re seeing our customers, as our PaaS business begins to increase in adoption. The customer wants to run the latest version of the database in the cloud and they want to match that up with the latest version of the database in their data center. They want to run this basically the same technology, both in our cloud in our \u2013 and their data center. And that\u2019s one of the unique value propositions that we offer our cloud customers the same exact technology on-premise and in the cloud. And those things will then co-exist for years and years to come. Then the customers are seeking up their version. We have a latest version in the cloud. They want the latest version on-premise. That\u2019s also accelerating the adoption of the database on-premise.","Raimo Lenschow","Thank you.","Ken Bond","Next question please.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel Nicolaus.","Brad Reback","Great. Thanks very much. If I look at the results geographically Asia and Europe look to be pretty solid especially given what\u2019s going on in Asia. North America seem to lag a bit. Were there any specific items that led to that underperformance?","Mark Hurd","No.","Safra Catz","No, you are also looking at the Americas, no. So, for example, hardware revenues particularly problematic for us in Latin America seems like that. So while you look at the Americas, you are actually seeing Latin America, which has issues, of course\u2026","Mark Hurd","With Brazil.","Safra Catz","Brazil and North America, Canada, altogether.","Mark Hurd","Yes, U.S. was fine. I think to your point, Asia was strong. We\u2019ve been doing our team as we talked about this before. We\u2019ve been doing a lot of rebuilding in Asia and then has really shown promise for us and the results reflect that in the quarter. Europe had a solid quarter overall excellent results from the cloud and U.S. was fine, we would be able to describe it. In the Americas, as Safra\u2019s point, you have the inclusion of Latin America, which is a great organization. It\u2019s done a great job. They\u2019re gaining share. In fact, if I look at every sort of metric we have in Latin America, we gain share in virtually every category we compete in the Latin America. But within the context of the quarter, the situation in Brazil is tough, which is reflected in these overall Americas results that you\u2019re describing.","Brad Reback","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much. Mark, I just want to double click on the strength in Fusion ERP, I guess, if we could. Just given how far in front you seem to be in that area. Are there any specific verticals or geographies that are sort of outsized in terms of how you guys are doing? And I was also curious about how much of the strength is sort of you guys going into the mid-market in a bigger way or the mid, upper, mid market in a bigger way? Are you actually starting to see some broader G 2,000 deals as well in terms of the ERP product? Thanks very much.","Mark Hurd","Well, my inclination to answer to your question, yes. But let me try to describe sort of what\u2019s happening. We talked a bit this a little bit at financial Analyst Day. The good news about ERP or ERP suite is it\u2019s still not available, it\u2019s just going into other geographies. So with the last release we had, we now brought on manufacturing and supply chain. We\u2019re now releasing the product for sale in some like, for example, in Brazil and some European countries. So we actually get some geographic expansion with the last release we had.","So this is actually good news. The strong in this case actually get stronger. We actually now have material number of references. I think I mentioned, but I\u2019m going to try again. We have over now 450 customers wide. This is a big, big metric. Our market also expands in a couple of ways with ERP, which makes it so important. We get two increases on our total available market, one is what you mentioned, the fact that we actually get to go down market now.","And, yes, we do have broad market expansion. We get to compete for companies that otherwise would never have had 90 staff couldn\u2019t have assembled in ERP system, we now get to compete. We also now remember when were in an ERP system, we were in the hardware we win everything, we win the whole stack. So our TAM really goes up on total available market on two dimensions, the total stack in addition to our ability to compete down market.","Now that\u2019s broad based, I \u2013 that\u2019s why I specifically used the names I did. Our success is not unique to mid-market or up-market, it\u2019s really both I mentioned the name of the biggest tele \u2013 I didn\u2019t mention the name very, very big telephone company in France very big industrial company, these are huge companies at the same time as we have $50 million company that are moving to our cloud ERP. So it is broad-based success across geographies. But the good news, I believe, I think we\u2019re just really getting started.","Kirk Materne","Great. Thanks. Happy holidays.","Mark Hurd","Thank you. Same to you.","Operator","We do have time for one follow-up question. And final question will come from the line of Joel Fishbein with BTIG.","Joel Fishbein","Hi, Larry. At Analyst Day you talked about building second-generation data center architecture that should improve Oracle\u2019s overall competitive positioning. Can you give us a little more color on what changes you\u2019re making and when this will be rolled out?","Mark Hurd","Well, again, I said we\u2019d \u2013 in my short remark before we start the Q&A I said that we will be delivering innovations and infrastructure as a service. And we have a next-generation data center that we\u2019ve been architecting and building, in fact, with actually put out the data centers actually kind of up and running. There are actually three data centers what we call on availability zone, they\u2019re all connected by a fiber-optic ring. And the thing we\u2019ve really that we focused on a number of things, obviously availability, performance, but security are all things you would expect us to focus on.","The big surprise \u2013 the big surprise, as we think, we would be by far the lowest cost provider of infrastructure as a service. We think we\u2019ve been in this business a very long time. We\u2019re very focused. This is our data \u2013 this is data center version two. We\u2019ve been doing this for a while now. And we think that our cost of delivering infrastructure as a service in the cloud much, much, much lower than anyone else\u2019s cost with this new architecture. And with these new data centers, we\u2019ll be passing that on to our customers.","Joel Fishbein","Great. Thank you.","Safra Catz","Okay. I just needed to answer, I think the question is quite similar. I think it\u2019s about from here about 3.5 to 4 point, something like that, okay?","Joel Fishbein","Thank you, Safra.","Ken Bond","A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking with you.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for closing.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect, and we thank you for your participation."],"16303":["Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) Q1 2020 Earnings Conference Call September 11, 2019  5:30 PM ET","Company Participants","Ken Bond - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Safra Catz - Chief Executive Officer","Larry Ellison - Chairman & Chief Technology Officer","Conference Call Participants","John DiFucci - Jefferies","Brad Zelnick - Credit Suisse","Phil Winslow - Wells Fargo","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Mark Moerdler - Bernstein","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Operator","Welcome to Oracle's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I'd now like to turn today's call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President. Ken?","Ken Bond","Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on short notice. Welcome to Oracle's first quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations' website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz.","As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements.","These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.","And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks.","And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.","Safra Catz","Thanks, Ken, and thank you, all, for joining us on such very short notice. Of course September 11th is an important day for our country and for us at Oracle. Many of you know that we lost 11 of our employees and many friends that day and we honor all the victims today and every day. May their memories be a blessing to all of us.","We originally planned to hold this call tomorrow. However, as Mark will be taking a leave of absence for health-related reasons, we felt it made sense to share all of our news at once.","Mark was extremely engaged with the business through the end of the quarter, but now he needs to focus on his health and taking care of himself. As the three of us have always worked as a team on managing Oracle, Larry and I will cover Mark's responsibilities during his absence with support from the rest of our strong management team.","Now, switching to the first quarter, I will review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. And though the effects of the currency movements in Q1 were modestly more than expected with a 1.3% headwind to total revenues and $0.01 headwind to earnings per share, both results were in line with my guidance range.","Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 4% and accounting for nearly three quarters of total company revenues and most of all of this revenue is recurring.","Cloud and On-Premise License revenues were $812 million, down 6% coming off 15% license growth last quarter. And as a reminder, because Q1 is normally our smallest quarter, we tend to see more volatility in new software license growth rates in Q1.","In terms of ecosystems, GAAP applications ecosystem revenues were $2.8 billion, up 3% with Fusion apps up nearly 40% including Fusion ERP, up mid-40s and Fusion HCM up low 30s. NetSuite ERP was up in the mid-20s. Vertical SaaS was up high single-digits while Data Cloud was down in the low teens.","On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is now recurring. GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $4.8 billion, up 3% with total database revenue up similarly highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up triple digits, but also small base for now.","On a trailing 12-month basis, more than three quarters of our infrastructure ecosystem is now recurring. In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in cloud revenue in all regions, with especially strong results in Latin America and Asia Pacific. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%. And as we continue to scale and grow, I expect our cloud gross margins will go higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth.","Total revenues for the quarter were $9.2 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 4% from last year; and the operating margin was 42%, up from 41% last year.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 9.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% and EPS was US$0.81 and up 16% in constant dollar and 14% in US$. The GAAP tax rate was 13.9% and GAAP EPS was US$0.63 and up 13% in constant currency and 11% in US$.","Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last four quarters, capital expenditures were $1.7 billion and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $36 billion in cash and marketable securities and the short-term deferred revenue balance is $10.9 billion.","As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 89 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 611 million shares for a total of $31 billion. And over the last five years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by an additional $15 billion and again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share.","My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currencies. Assuming, current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative on EPS. Of course, that could change. So, for Q2, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow from 0% to 2% in U.S. dollars.","Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.88 and $0.90 in constant currency. And assuming the $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in U.S. dollars is expected to grow between 9% and 11% and be between US$0.87 and US$0.89.","For fiscal 2020 and the third consecutive fiscal quarter, I expect that we will report double-digit EPS growth in constant currency. Total CapEx for fiscal year 2020 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move a little depending on our bookings, and how much we need to invest to accommodate them.","My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal 2020 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020.","I'm turning the call over to Larry for his comments, who will spend a little time highlighting some of the key wins we had during the quarter with emphasis on back-office applications, and then talk about autonomous database.","Larry Ellison","Thank you, Safra. As you're already aware, our back-office applications business has been reporting excellent growth for a number of quarters now. And we have a massive opportunity ahead of us in both ERP and HCM. Not only do we have an enormous installed base of existing ERP and HCM customers, who can operate to the cloud, but more than half of the current ERP and HCM market is served by companies, who have no SaaS upgrade path. These companies products are vulnerable to being replaced, and we're in the process of replacing them.","Our investments in Fusion has not only enabled our strong back-office results over the last few years, but they've positioned us to become not just the biggest back-office player in the cloud, which we already are but the biggest back-office player period. Cloud on-premises all of it.","So with that, here are some key Fusion ERP wins from Q1. DP World, Shaw Communications, Bangkok Bank of Thailand, who's upgrading their e-business suite with our Fusion Financials Cloud Service and our Fusion Financial Enterprise Performance Management, Envision Healthcare where we beat Workday and we're replacing Envision Healthcare's legacy system, which is an Infor Lawson system.","Express Scripts who's in the process of migrating from Hyperion on-premise to the Fusion EPM in the cloud this is their first cloud application. Lyft who's operating a portion of their ERP system that was \u2013 started out as NetSuite but is now Fusion as they plan for growth going forward. Media newsroom another competitive win against Workday. National Oilwell Varco in a nice expansion both their EPM and supply chain management that we closed last year. So they're just \u2013 they're adding more products, they're adding \u2013 adding more of our overall Fusion suite.","NGL Energy Partners has also bought our Fusion ERP suite and supply chain management. Penn National Gaming is an online gaming company and that was a competitive win against the unnamed German company located at a town called Waldorf.","Standard Group Limited a large garment manufacturer where we beat that same Waldorf German Company. Southern Company is a utility that was running E-Business Suite and PeopleSoft E-Business Suite Financials and PeopleSoft HCM and they're moving to the Fusion Cloud suite overall Financials HCM everything.","Continuing, we've got some great \u2013 some great additional just HCM wins. BAE Systems chose Fusion HCM to upgrade their HR technology and standardize on the cloud. Dubai Holdings where we're expanding our relationship by adding both Fusion HCM and Taleo for recruiting. Envision Healthcare is adding infusion HCM to the already-purchased Fusion ERP suite. A very large transportation entity in the U.K. an airport who is a long-term E-Business Suite customer is moving from on-premise to the Fusion suite in the cloud.","Here's a company everyone's always heard of and probably has visited many times McDonald's. McDonald's chose our HCM. They chose our payroll. And they -- this was a battle between us and Workday. We won. And we're displacing their on-premise legacy system. Nestle; Southwest Gas where we're displacing SAP and we beat Workday, as Southwest Gas decided to move from SAP on-premise to the cloud and they picked us.","The University of Texas and we're actually engaged with them on not only providing cloud technology, but also consulting support to migrate them from PeopleSoft on-premise to the Fusion HCM in the cloud. And it's just not a bunch of customer wins that marks our success. Industry analysts including IDC are taking notice as they survey their customers.","In the 2019 SaaS\/PaaS survey that IDC released in May of 2019, it surveyed over 1,500 of their SaaS customers on their experience with all SaaS vendors including Oracle, SAP, Salesforce, Workday, Microsoft all of them. Oracle SaaS had the highest rating among all SaaS vendor survey period.","So you can see we're at the beginning of a back-office upgrade cycle that will benefit our applications ecosystem for years to come. We're already overwhelmingly the largest ERP system in the cloud. And again, it won't be long before we're just the largest ERP supplier period.","The second area I'd like to talk about is the Autonomous Database, because we think this is a game changer. All right game changer interesting term. It sounds like a clich\u00e9 a little bit of marketing hype. Let me explain how important this is. Autonomous technology is the key element that differentiates a second-generation cloud from a first-generation cloud.","Now in the first-generation cloud, your real benefit was you were going to rent computers and you only pay for what you use. And the benefit of a second generation -- and not so great benefit, obviously the first-generation cloud pay for what you use when you use it.","Second-generation cloud, not only do we deliver the benefits of pay per use, we also take the human labor out of running the cloud. That's an even bigger economic savings. Sharing computers and renting computers is not as costly as paying for the labor to run those computers.","So from an economic advantage, a second-generation autonomous cloud is much less expensive to run than a first-generation cloud. But that's not what's really important. What's really important is the second-generation autonomous cloud prevents data theft, which you can never do in a first-generation manual cloud.","Let me point out how reasonable Amazon was when they refused to accept responsibility for the configuration errors made by the people at Capital One. They have a policy so you have control of your data. You have control of your system. You are responsible for running your system. And if you make mistakes, it's on you, it's not on us. That is not an unreasonable position. When you have a totally manual system and your users are responsible for configuring the system, when your users are responsible for backing the system up, when your users are responsible for encrypting the data, when your users are responsible for patching the systems, user errors can lead to catastrophic results. In a manual system, there's no way to prevent that.","In an autonomous system, the Capital One data breach could never have happened, because the Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't let a human being configure the system, it configures itself automatically. The Oracle Autonomous Database system doesn't ask human beings to patch it to close security holes. The system automatically patches itself while running.","The Oracle Database doesn't ask if you want to back it up or if you want to encrypt your data, it does all of this automatically while it's running. The only way you can prevent data theft is to eliminate human error. The only way you can do that was with an Autonomous Database and we have one and our competitors don't. This is a very big deal.","What's the greatest thing about autonomous driving? I was looking forward to autonomous driving. Then they've seen the threat to Uber and all this other stuff. But okay, that's all interesting. The greatest thing about autonomous driving, it's going to reduce human pilot error and cut down on accidents by 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%. It's going to save lives. It's going to stop, come close to eliminating pilot error.","The Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle self-driving database prevents users from making catastrophic mistakes resulting in data loss. And there is no way to do it in a manual cloud, end of story. That's what I mean by game changer.","You want to prevent data theft, you better be prepared to pay less, because we take the labor out, huge cost savings and there are no human beings involved and they can't make those common mistakes. All right.","So we're still early on in the Autonomous Database in terms of -- it's only been around -- we announced it in Open World 2017 two years ago and really showed up in 2018 and now we're beginning to get some traction with this exciting new technology. It's proving to be the most exciting and successful new product offering in the history of our company.","So here -- I got it. I'm sorry, am I missing? I'm curious \u2013 sorry, I got it. All right. So here's some recent data. In Q1, we added more than 3,700 new Autonomous Database trials. We now have over 2,000 customers, paying customers for the autonomous database. We're seeing incredible pull-through with the autonomous database. And you come to Oracle -- the Oracle Cloud to use the Autonomous Database and then you use a variety of other services.","About 45% of the people who are using Autonomous Database are also using our Oracle Analytics Cloud. By the way they're also using Microsoft analytics, they're using Cognos, they're using a variety of other tools. But primarily, they're using Oracle Analytics.","We've added many customers to Autonomous Database that weren't Oracle customers at all. 13% of the people using Autonomous Database had never bought a database from Oracle Corporation.","43% of the workloads that are going on to Autonomous Database are net new. They're not moving them from on-premise to the Autonomous Database, but half of them move from on-premise to Autonomous Database. Almost the other half 43% are just net new applications.","We've had some fabulous wins in the quarter. Obviously, I'm not going to mention all it. We have over 500 wins, Autonomous Database wins in the quarter. I'm not going to mention all 500. But 7-Eleven is moving all their point-of-sale data to the Autonomous Data warehouse Cargojet Canada, Johnson Controls, LATAM Airlines is moving their on-premise data centers to OCI to get the advantage and security of the Autonomous Database. Siemens Energy, Stanley Black & Decker getting much faster data reporting on their analytics. Oh yeah, and one more company moving to the Autonomous Database is Uber.","And with that, let's turn it back to the operator.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Larry. Holly before we go to the Q&A, just a couple of clarifications, because I had a couple of e-mails on this. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.8%. And then for fiscal year 2020, we expect for the full year, this will be our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth.","With that, Holly, why don't we turn up to Q&A?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John DiFucci Jefferies.","John DiFucci","Thank you. I'm sure I speak for everyone just to briefly say that our thoughts and prayers are with Mark and his family at this time. But also knowing Mark for years, I'm sure he'd like us to sort of get back to business, so I'll move right to question here.","So, there was -- Cloud Services and License Support was strong this quarter, but License was not as strong as we modeled it anyway. And I realize it's a seasonally slow first quarter and you said it follows the strongest and yes really strong fourth quarter as strong as we've seen in quite some time. But is there anything else you can share on that line, any further color? For instance, BYOL has got a lot of traction right?","And could that cause your financials just to start to trend more seasonally sort of like it used to? I mean it started to get a little more even it's still seasonal, but a little more even. Should we be starting to think of seasonality how Oracle used to be even more seasonal, or we're also hearing you guys you hear it too you hear from some other companies that talk about macro pressure. Are you seeing any of that at all? I'm just curious any color would be helpful.","Safra Catz","Sure. That's easy John. It was actually something very, very simple. First of all, outside of North America, our license was up, up quite a bit in fact internationally. What we had done in North America is we did do a split in the salesforce. We've been telegraphing that we were doing that before we split the North America tech salesforce between selling cloud -- a group selling cloud; and a group selling new licenses.","So, the group selling new license was a new group and so I expect that they will more than recover during the year. But that is the only -- that's the only weakness we had and it was simply just a slow start as we reorged the North America tech sales force since we split it. So, there's no macro issue. There's no actual regular issue. And of course the thing is that in Q1, small numbers make a big difference and so they just kind of outsized. But no we don't see anything and that's really all it was.","John DiFucci","Okay. That's really -- that's helpful Safra and that makes sense and sort of we're hearing things about that and just a quick follow-up maybe for Larry. Larry last quarter you had really strong results in the database options and most especially the ones related to the Autonomous Database.","I'm just curious in this quarter, again, a seasonally softer first quarter, but can you talk about the options themselves? And I'm thinking more about things like -- my favorite is multi-tenancy, but there's others that are important too.","Larry Ellison","I think multi-tenancy in memory all of the database options that are used with the Autonomous Database I think are selling very, very well. Again the reorg in North America had a great impact on that because those are license sales and then they bring those licenses to the cloud. So, people buy multi-tenant. They buy rack. They buy in memory. They then pick up those options and their existing licenses up and they move them to the cloud.","So, some of those sales were delayed because of the reorg, but we think the demand is enormous. And we think the leading indicator is just the number of trials we've signed up in Q1. So, our cloud salesforce in terms of the cloud activity, we had incredible cloud activity. And we expect -- again we signed more than 500 deals Autonomous Database deals in Q1. 3700 new trials the 500 signed paying customers more of them and we expect to double that in Q2.","So, we expect to go from well over 1,000 paying customers and that pipeline to just start building. That is the best early indicator. And that will drive not only cloud revenue, but also license revenue because of the options.","Ken Bond","Next question, please.","John DiFucci","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse.","Brad Zelnick","Great. Thanks so much. I'll start just by echoing John's sentiment and wish Mark a very speedy recovery. But getting on with business, I wanted to dig in a little bit to the great momentum that you're seeing in cloud ERP? And you gave a lot of color Larry in your comments, but perhaps if you can help us understand what the demand patterns look like amongst existing customers migrating versus new logo business that you're able to attract. And as well, that market has always been a fragmented market. And is there any evidence that you might be benefiting from consolidation finally in ERP which has so many players that's in the long tail? Thank you.","Larry Ellison","Well, I think -- let me talk about some of the easiest consolidations. We're picking on Lawson. We actually have sales territories which are Lawson Healthcare sales territories. So, we go out there -- the Lawson Healthcare customers and we've rolled up a bunch of those. I'd say about one-third of their customers of Lawson Healthcare customers are in our pipeline, either already converted or in our pipeline. So, we expect to win all of those. We've just added some new sales territories which are Lawson retail territories, which is a combination of our Fusion Financials and our retail merchandising products. And we think that's also a very vulnerable company that Infor really -- well they tried. A lot of people have tried to build cloud systems. It's not easy. I can attest to that. I have lots of scars. But I mean Fusion took 10 years to get going. I mean, it's a big deal.","And NetSuite that overnight success took 20 -- been in business over 20 years. Salesforce has been in business over 20 years. It takes a while to build these very complicated systems. And Lawson doesn't really have anything. So we're taking a bunch of their customers. But the one that's extraordinary is that SAP really does not have a true cloud system. SAP is doing some hosting. They don't have a true cloud system. And now we're seeing kind of some of their larger -- not the very largest companies, but some of their medium large companies, go ahead and pick us and we're converting them.","But we are in conversations with their very largest -- SAP's very, very largest customers. We're in the middle of converting one of their very, very largest customers. And we think that of course is the huge opportunity. We think we -- right now Oracle and SAP has about half the European market. I'm sorry; it's a very long answer. We have about half -- the two of us have about half of the European market. And the other half of the European market as you say highly fragmented. We started out by targeting the highly fragmented guys who are really weak and vulnerable, but we think the opportunity exists to roll it all up. If you look at our market -- I mean I'm almost afraid to mention what our market share in ERP and the cloud is. What is it, 95%?","Safra Catz","A lot.","Larry Ellison","I mean, I don't know. I mean just, I'm guessing, but I don't know because I don't know of any other cloud ERP system other than NetSuite and Fusion, so maybe 95% is low. I mean, it sound a little crazy. But SAP really did not rewrite their code. They really don't have a cloud system. And we have an opportunity to go after them and just put that aside and then that whole other half of the ERP marketplace which is companies that a lot of people have never heard of. And yes, I think we can consolidate virtually all of that. I mean, I don't know how to describe it. It's a crazy opportunity. You don't see this happen very often.","Ken Bond","Next question, please.","Brad Zelnick","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow, Wells Fargo.","Phil Winslow","Hey, thanks for taking my question and I just wanted to echo Mark just wishing you the speediest recovery and all the best. And to the team, congrats on a solid start to the year. I just wanted to follow up on John's question on the database. One of the questions I get from investors is sort of the trajectory of database because obviously we're getting some metrics from you guys, that's showing an inflection in terms of customers, also just trials out there. How do you think about just I guess the shape of the curve of database growth going forward with all these different levers?","Larry Ellison","Okay. Well, because the growth rate is so extraordinary, we don't -- we're not forecasting it. I mean, when Safra gives you a forecast, she's not forecasting some -- this incredibly steep growth curve in Autonomous Database. So, we're giving you, I would say a conservative point of view especially in terms of Autonomous Database. And \u2013 but again, this is the case where we have a technology that nobody else has, A, we are the dominant database supplier on the planet right now.","We're bigger than IBM and Microsoft combined. In the previous battles, in the previous war on-premise, we were bigger than Microsoft and IBM combined our two biggest competitors. The cloud based \u2013 there are a bunch of open source cloud databases and there is a lot of more specialized, I mean there are probably a dozen of them, or more for that matter. But none of them are autonomous. None of them are secure. None of them task themselves, while running. None of them give you 99.995% availability. I mean, they're \u2013 we're 100 times more reliable. I mean seriously a 100x more reliable than these guys.","We have the only system that we can pretty much ensure that your data can't be stolen, because you're \u2013 because you can't make pilot errors. You can't commit \u2013 you can't make mistakes, because all that's \u2013 all of those decisions are automated. So, it's another \u2013 I mean, so we're sitting in two markets that we have an opportunity of completely dominating and owning.","One is ERP, where we've been in it for a while and you actually can see the data \u2013 you can actually see the curve and the curve \u2013 and the curves \u2013 the curve we have enough years of data that you can see the slope of the curve and you can do these market share studies. There are always analyst reports and all that. And we've made great progress in that and you can see it.","In the Autonomous Database, all you can do is listen to me talk about this extraordinary technology. And we're so early on in the curve we've got such little data in the curve. I understand \u2013 and even we're playing let's wait and see what this turns out to be. But we have this gigantic installed base that's I think going to go with Autonomous Database. But it's not just that it's not safe to go to any other database. That's a pretty good differentiator. And it's our second extraordinary opportunity. ERP back-office in the cloud, Autonomous Database in the cloud, we're successful in those two markets, should be enough to make a living.","Phil Winslow","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you so much. And again, I'm going to echo everyone's thoughts for Mark and thoughts with him and his family. Just wanted to ask two quick questions. One, if I could, Safra I know John DiFucci asked some questions about the environment. You talked about the North American sales reorg. I was wondering, just you've seen a lot of results since August, early August come in where maybe results haven't been as good as people wide. I'm just wondering if you're seeing \u2013 if you saw any elongation in the sales cycles, if there's anything you can share with us there just globally from what you've been seeing.","And then secondly, just a question related to OCI and \u2013 I know obviously Open World's next week. There'll be a lot of partners to talk to. But a lot of the partners we've been speaking to of late have talked about a real pickup in momentum there. And just wondering, if you can share with us what you're seeing? Thank you.","Safra Catz","Sure. Actually, we feel like we've got a lot of momentum here at Oracle. The issue regarding markets either abroad, or in the United States we're not seeing it. The \u2013 we're on very, very positive momentum from a product cycle point of view. Our Fusion products are basically killing it. That's doing amazingly. Autonomous Database and the whole OCI is so compelling. And we are on the field, and we are expanding globally that we have just so much good news happening around the world that we're not seeing the weaknesses. And so to the extent that there are, we just have a lot of company, product, momentum, ourselves, I know that I will not be able to hold Larry back from answering your second question. So I'm just unleashing him in advance of Open World. Go ahead Larry.","Larry Ellison","Okay. So next week at Open World, we're going to be talking about \u2013 we started with Autonomous Database in 2018. We continued to make improvements there and speeding it up. And \u2013 but we're not at Autonomous Database.","At Open World, we'll be announcing a whole bunch of new autonomous services. No one is doing this. But we're not talking about Autonomous Database. So you're going to see a bunch of arguments where we take that same machine learning technology to develop other autonomous services. And we're on our way. I mean, it's our goal to deliver the world's first and only completely autonomous cloud, the most important thing in keeping your data sites. But we'd like -- I mean, you really should have an autonomous operating system.","You should have a bunch of autonomous services in that to operate that cloud, so human beings aren't given the opportunity to make mistakes and people can concentrate on building applications rather than managing the plumbing of the cloud, which is complicated and error prone and expensive. So we want to take -- get rid of the expense, get rid of the errors.","Starting with Autonomous Database, you'll see a bunch more announcements of new autonomous services in OCI. And OCI is definitely on a roll. If people come to look at Autonomous Database, they look around in the Oracle Cloud and they see our analytics, our compute I can talk about all these other things, but we have -- we really have a second-generation cloud that's highly differentiated from our friends in Amazon or Google.","Heather Bellini","Thank you.","Ken Bond","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler, Bernstein.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you very much for taking question. Again, I echo everyone else. Please tell Mark that our thoughts are with him and his family. Larry, Safra given autonomous adoption commentary how good it's going, can you give us some more color based off this quarter on how the revenue lift is occurring as customers moving to the Autonomous Database based on what you're seeing in sales that is going now, how that's trending? And any sense to how to think about how large Autonomous Database revenue is, any color would be appreciated?","Larry Ellison","Well, our approach, I mean, sometimes they're critical of Amazon. Sometimes I'm just -- I try to learn from what they do. I mean they were the innovator in cloud and I give them credit for that. And I think the strategy of land and expand, which is what Amazon has used in marketing their products, so you get in for one project and you're successful on that project, then you go to the next project, it's been very different than the way Oracle has been selling in the past.","We have adopted with Autonomous Database. We've adopted that land start small, get in there on a project just demonstrates how great this technology is and then get another project and another project after that.","So we've adopted this land-and-expand approach. And we have many examples where people have been successful in their first projects and have moved on to two more moved on to -- then moved on to 10 more after that, so we see -- again, the opportunity is gigantic. The fact that we have four -- that we added 4,000 -- almost 4,000 trials, short of 4,000 trials in Q1 is an example of how we're really getting traction now and the word is getting out about how good the Autonomous Database is, how big is it as an overall market.","Safra Catz","It's brilliant. The reality is that most of our customers have been waiting for us. They've not brought those critical large and security-conscious workloads. They've not brought them to the cloud so far. They didn't bring them to the other vendors. The other vendors are all actually having trouble in the enterprise with these important workloads. They have been waiting for us. And so as they've started to bring smaller workloads in, they can start quite small. And then their next buy is 10 times the size and the opportunities often 1,000 times the size. And that's what we're starting to see. How long will it take? I don't know.","We're not -- we're trying to just go with it. You have to understand that many of these can also go just pay as you go, they're never forecasted. A customer just tries it and before you know it it's expanding. The opportunity is literally enormous, because many of these workloads, they can't go to the cloud any other way. Those that have tried have been either unsuccessful or it's been both expensive and risk their security situation.","So this is a very, very powerful moment for us. We're not going to overplay it here. We're just going to ride along with it. You're going to hear at Open World from some of these customers. And it's very much like originally, when we start to talk to you about our Engineered Systems, where a customer would try a little bit, they'll try one a quarter. And before you know it, they had dozens and they grew. Now this is the next level for those critical workloads that only can work in our cloud.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Ken Bond","Next question, please.","Operator","And our last question for today is going to come from the line of Raimo Lenschow, Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow","Hey, let me echo as well all our prayers are with Mark and his family. Just going back, I have two quick questions, one number question, which was on deferred Safra, in theory that should grow, can you just maybe talk a little bit about why that declined this quarter?","But then the bigger question was more for me around ERP. Larry you talked about like you saw some medium-sized SAP customers starting to look. And is it -- kind of in terms of going bigger, is it kind of a question of functionality and capability or more around referenceability? Because if I look at your -- you just deleveraged full quarter's numbers. You closed the quarter in 11, 12 days and were able to deliver that, which is kind of a record I've seen. And you guys are using Oracle Fusion. So it's really power -- it seems like a very powerful solution. So I'm just wondering what's holding it back at this point. Thank you.","Safra Catz","Well, first, I'd like to thank you for noticing the amazing close we did on Fusion Financials and we actually -- I got to tell you the team, I think is pretty happy with this result and realize that all of our customers should be easily doing the same thing. So, first, yes, this was a very quick close, but we've got the technology and the people to do it.","Let me just answer your deferred revenue comment. So I just want you to understand gross deferred revenue is actually up 3%, okay? But we net it to a bunch of things that ultimately are simply timing changes related to collections. And so that's really the only thing. There's nothing unusual next quarter you may see something different. It's literally a matter of when we pay some things and that kind of shows up in the operating cash flow.","But in deferred revenue, it's simply timing of collections. There's a little bit impacted by currency, but the gross deferred revenue number is actually up 3%. It's just netted down and it's just a matter of the timing of our collections, so nothing to see here.","Larry Ellison","Okay. The question about SAP, what are our big SAP customers waiting for before they make a decision to move to Oracle. It's been very interesting. We've -- I've spent a lot of time in Germany and talking to some customers and they want to move. I mean, I talked to several very large customers saying, we'd like to move to the cloud. We'd like to move to Fusion. Because I mean some of the -- I mean, moving to another SAP system -- and I mean some of these guys are facing bills of $1 billion to migrate -- for this SAP upgrade all of the consultants. So I mean, it's a big pill to swallow to do the upgrade HANA, what they call S\/4HANA in the cloud except, it's not really a cloud.","Safra Catz","And for no benefit.","Larry Ellison","And for virtually, it's the same code you had before. It really is pretty much the same code you had before. So the customers really want to do it. What they're waiting for is one really large customer who's already done it. They are worried. They don't want to be first. No one wants -- none of these big -- these customers are conservative. They don't want to be first.","We are in the middle of one of their largest customers converting them to Fusion. And as soon as we can talk about that publicly and use that as a reference, which will be probably will take another six months before we can do that, maybe less. But that's close, it's pretty close before they're live and several of their divisions are on Fusion.","Almost every business leader I talk to in Germany wants to make the migration they just have to be assured that it will work. Now we're going to get -- we've won some deals in the high and at mid-market against SAP incumbents, and they're in the process of converting. And if we can get them converted much faster and get them live much faster then we can this one jumped in this one of the largest enterprises on earth that we're converting.","But as we get a few of these references, we think people -- customers want to use modern technology, they want to move to the cloud. And we can -- they can do that with Fusion and they cannot do it with SAP. So we think it's a huge opportunity for us, but we have to have a core of references before these big guys are going to move.","Raimo Lenschow","Okay. Thank you. That's very clear.","Ken Bond","Thank you, Larry. A telephonic replay of this conference call would be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today on short notice. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Holly for closing.","Operator","Thank you for joining us for today's Oracle first quarter 2020 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
