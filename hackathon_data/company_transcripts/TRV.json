Welcome to the first quarter results teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question and answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 22, 2014.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our first quarter 2014 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also available for the question and answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for your questions.","Before I turn it over to Jay, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risk and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.","Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.","Now, Jay Fishman.","Jay Fishman","Thank you, Gabi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased to report an outstanding start to 2014 with net and operating income of over a billion dollars and record net and operating income per diluted share of $2.95. Our operating return on equity of nearly 18% in the quarter is the highest since the fourth quarter of 2009 when we posted just over 18%. These results keep us very much on track to meet our financial objective of achieving a mid-teens return on equity over time, and this is the case even if one were to exclude our favorable prior year reserve development in the quarter given that our accident year operating return on equity was 14.7%.","In the fourth quarter of last year, I shared with you that we believe we were firing on all cylinders, and that continues today. We had terrific first quarter results in business insurance where profitability improved once again. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with our efforts to improve returns through the continued execution of our granular pricing strategy. Given our segmentation approach of seeking appropriate returns on an account-by-account and class-by-class basis, we have shared with you that the headline aggregate rate gain which is the result of our active pricing strategy will come down as we continue to execute this strategy. Some industry observers perceive this as an indication of increasing price competitiveness. We reject that notion because we are managing our pricing actions very thoughtfully and in that regard for our individually underwritten accounts we have the ability to consider each individual account\u2019s contribution before engaging in renewal negotiations. This is where analytical competitive advantage based on data really matters. ","Our strategy is very much proactive and much less reactive than it seems many industry observers believe. That said, our assessment of the competitive environment as it relates to rate is that it is for the most part unchanged. This is supported by the fact that we continued to achieve historically high levels of account retention. Another point of support is the data we are providing on Slide 4 of the webcast which for our middle market business compares the renewal rate gain and number of accounts in the poorest performing segment of this business in the first quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2013. You can see that the renewal rate gain was virtually the same in these quarters but that the number of accounts qualifying as poorest performing and renewed in the quarter declined from 289 to 216. As our overall portfolio improves and the number of accounts in our poorest performance band has declined, the change in the aggregate headline rate gain to the extent that this band contributes to that headline number reflects the decline in accounts in this band rather than a change in the competitive environment within the band. In summary, given that our goal is to achieve improved returns consistent with our financial objectives, there\u2019s nothing that we see happening in the competitive environment today that causes us to be less optimistic about our ability to achieve our goal. ","In financial, professional and international insurance, we achieved 20% growth in operating income and a 47% increase in net written premiums, both from the impact of the Dominion acquisition and strong performance in our management liability and surety businesses. Our integration efforts in Canada are very much on track and we are really pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made.","Turning to personal insurance, in homeowners we produced a combined ratio of 72.4% or 86.5% excluding favorable prior year development, even considering the meaningful winter weather we experienced in the quarter. This performance, taken in the context of our results over the last decade, continues to demonstrate industry-leading performance. In personal auto, we experienced 1.1 points of improvement in the underlying combined ratio. More importantly, we are very excited about the deployment of our new personal auto product, Quantum Auto 2.0. We\u2019ve now rolled the product out in 28 states and the District of Columbia. It was our expectation that this product would dramatically improve our comparative rate or quoting position, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re experiencing so far.","While we\u2019ve achieved this improvement largely through reductions in price, it is critical to note that this lower price structure is based upon the expense actions we have committed to and meaningfully achieved, as well as a lower commission for Quantum Auto 2.0. Consequently, once fully rolled out, we believe the product is priced to produce returns that are consistent with our long-term goal. While we are reasonably confident in our estimates of loss content, particularly because the product was built largely on the foundation of Quantum Auto 1.0, it will take a few more quarters for us to know more. We will continue to roll this product out across the country and we are pleased that we now have a product that can successfully compete in this rapidly changing marketplace. Brian will speak more about Quantum 2.0, and we look forward to talking to you more about our strategy in personal insurance during our investor day on June 6.","Finally, this morning we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend per share of 10% to $0.55 per share, which is the tenth consecutive year we\u2019ve increased our quarterly dividend. We note that the compound annual growth rate for our dividend over that time is 9.6%.","With that, let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay Benet","Thanks Jay. By any measure, our first quarter results \u2013 record net and operating income per diluted share of $2.95, operating ROE of 17.8%, and a GAAP combined ratio of 85.7% - were exceptional. As was the case in recent quarters, these strong results were built upon very solid investment results primarily driven by private equity and real estate returns along with very strong underwriting performance. Within underwriting, earned rate increases continued to exceed loss cost trends in each of our business segments, although this benefit to our loss ratio was mostly offset by the severe CAT and non-CAT winter weather that gripped the country this quarter. Our loss ratio also benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development of $294 million pre-tax, which was up $63 million from the prior year quarter, and was adversely impacted by catastrophe losses of $149 million pre-tax which were up $50 million. ","In addition, our expense ratio benefited from a $76 million pre-tax reduction in an estimated liability for state assessment that we were required to pay in relation to our workers\u2019 compensation premiums. This reduction in our estimated liability resulted from a change in state law that took effect in the first quarter of 2014 that clarified our payment obligations.","Each of our business segments once again produced net favorable prior year reserve development. In BI, net favorable development of $93 million was driven by better than expected loss experience for general liability excess coverages that resulted from a more favorable legal and judicial environment than we had expected, as well as favorable CAT and non-CAT property loss development partially offset by higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages within CMP. Net favorable development of $69 million in FP&II primarily resulted from better than expected results in contact surety and bond and financial products, while in PI net favorable reserve development of $132 million was primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in homeowners and other for CAT and non-CAT weather-related losses. On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 accident year 2004 and prior developed unfavorably by a de minimis amount, approximately $11 million, while each accident year in the period 2005 through 2013 developed favorably in this quarter. ","Operating cash flows were very strong, a little over $700 million, and up from $530 million in the prior year quarter. We ended the quarter with over $1.6 billion of holding company liquidity and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.6 billion pre-tax or $1.7 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion respectively at the beginning of the year mostly due to reductions in spreads. Book value per share was $73.06 or 7% higher than a year ago and 4% higher than at the beginning of this year.","Turning to capital management, we continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $882 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $177 million and repurchased $705 million of our common shares, including $650 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, and $55 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. Finally, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 per share to $0.55, a 10% increase on top of last year\u2019s 9% increase.","So with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.","Brian McLean","Thanks Jay. In business insurance, we had a very strong quarter with operating income of $653 million and a combined ratio of 87.7. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of CATs in prior year development, was 88.1 for the quarter, an improvement of four points year-over-year. As always, there were some moving pieces in the combined ratio this quarter, including a favorable non-recurring expense item and unfavorable non-CAT weather losses. Excluding these items, margin expansion driven by the impact of earned rate in excess of loss trends was about two points.","Turning to production trends, beginning on Page 10, retention was up in the quarter to 81% while renewal premium change was down somewhat from recent periods at about 7%. The 7% included pure rate increases of about 5%, down about a point from last quarter. The rate increases continued to be broad-based and were led by commercial auto. New business volume in the quarter of $443 million was similar to recent periods.","Loss trend continued to run at about 4% for the segment, so on a written basis rate gains continued to be above our current view of loss trend. The production results for the quarter within the segment tell somewhat different stories this quarter, so I\u2019d like to spend a moment discussing each of them individually.","Beginning on Page 11 with select accounts, our small commercial business, the production metrics reflect the impact of our active strategy to improve the profitability on portions of this business. For some time, we have been taking the necessary actions to improve our returns, and those actions have been successful; consequently, we are shifting focus and rate expectations to retaining more of our business and are pleased with the four point improvement in retention this quarter. We also feel very good about the 9.2% renewal premium change we achieved for the quarter.","Turning to commercial accounts on Slide 12, both the aggregate rate and retention were unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2013, but as we\u2019ve commented before, it\u2019s not the aggregate number that we focus on. As we have successfully executed our strategy of improving the returns of this business over time, the headline aggregate rate increase number has moderated while retention has improved. We continue to execute a very granular strategy to retain our best performing accounts and to get significant rate increases on our poor performing business. As we enter the fourth year of implementing this strategy, our ability to execute is largely unchanged. So in summary, we continue to see a pretty stable commercial accounts market with rate and retention dynamics consistent with improving product margins.","Looking at other business insurance on Slide 13, the environment is largely the same as for commercial accounts with the exception of the larger end of our national property business, specifically large layered property risks where we have seen rate pressure intensify. For perspective, our entire national property book represents about 5% of our total business insurance net written premiums, and the large layered programs are a subset of this. ","In the financial, professional and international segment, operating income of $195 million was very strong and up 20% over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by the inclusion of the Dominion, higher levels of underlying underwriting margins, and our decision to exit a management liability excess of loss reinsurance treaty in 2014. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 90%, a slight improvement from the prior year. The improvement was due to earned rate in excess of loss trend across the segment along with the exit from the management liability reinsurance treaty I just mentioned, largely offset by the impact of the Dominion. ","The Dominion had a negative impact of 2.2 points on the segment underlying combined ratio. This is the first quarter that reflects the full impact of the Dominion acquisition and I\u2019m pleased to say that the integration is proceeding in line with our expectations. Of course, we expect that the Dominion results will improve over time; however, given its relative size, we don\u2019t intend to spike it out going forward.","Turning to production results, surety gross written premium of $216 million was up from $195 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting gains in contract surety. In management liability, retention and renewal premium change remain strong at 85% and 8% respectively while new business was down a little bit from recent periods. In international, retention continued to improve and came in at 83% for the quarter, renewal premium change rose to nearly 3%, and new business was up significantly year-over-year due to the impact of Dominion. So overall, a great quarter for the segment.","In our personal insurance business, operating income of $268 million for the quarter was up 36% versus the first quarter of 2013, driven by higher net favorable reserve development in homeowners along with improved underlying underwriting results in both auto and home. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 87.4, and improvement of about two points versus the first quarter of 2013 due to lower expenses, along with rate increases in excess of loss trend, partially offset by higher non-CAT weather-related losses. ","Looking specifically at auto production, retention remains strong at 81%, renewal premium change was about 6%, while new business volume was up significantly versus recent periods due to the rollout of our new product, Quantum Auto 2.0. Jay spoke about how pleased we are with the early production results for Quantum 2.0, and I\u2019d like to take a moment to give you some additional color on our progress on the expense initiatives that are fundamental to our ability to make our auto product more price competitive.","As you recall, in addition to a two-point commission reduction for the new product, we\u2019re taking actions on our operating expenses which will result in savings of about $140 million pre-tax. To date, we\u2019ve executed on initiatives responsible for about two-thirds of the $140 million run rate savings and we remain on target to achieve the full run rate saves by the end of this year, in line with our original expectations.","As we mentioned last year, the operating expense reductions are primarily intended to benefit auto but will also benefit the homeowners results. In terms of impact on the combined ratio, the benefit from the operating expense reductions will be split roughly equally between the loss ratio due to claim expense reductions and the expense ratio due to other insurance expense reductions. We believe that the initial success of Quantum 2.0 is due not only to the delivery of a product with competitive price and a structure that better responds to consumer buying preferences, but also to the strength of our long-term relationships to the independent agent channel and the fact that we are a recognized brand in the marketplace.","Turning to auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio was 92.3 for the quarter, an improvement of over a point versus the first quarter of 2013, and was driven by earned rate increases in excess of loss trend. Our current view of auto loss trend remains at about 4% with no significant change in the underlying texture from previous quarters.","Looking at homeowners, production was strong in the quarter with renewal premium change of about 8.5% while retention remained at 84% and new business volume was up from the prior year quarter due in part to a lift from the improved auto new business. From a profitability perspective, the underlying combined ratio was approximately 80%, an improvement of close to 1.5 points versus the first quarter of 2013 and was driven by lower expenses, earned rate increases in excess of loss trend, partially offset by non-CAT weather-related losses.","With that, let me turn it over to Gabi.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Before we open it up for questions and answers, may I ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, please. Thank you.","We can now open it up for the question and answer period.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you. I had a question, actually \u2013 Jay, has anything changed in terms of your philosophy around CAT or non-CAT weather reserving philosophy, just because it looks like this year and we\u2019ve seen a little bit recently non-CAT weather creates difficult comps on the underlying but provides for favorable reserve development for prior year. So is that coincidence that those\u2014I\u2019m just curious, has that changed in the last year or two? Thanks.","Jay Benet","This is Jay Benet. There\u2019s no change in the way we go about reserving. Reserving is based on the actual storms that take place and then the assumptions that surround that, and one of the things that we\u2019ve had some difficulty with has been the weather patterns of the last several years. If you recall, not so much last year but the couple of years before that, when there was a lot of tornado experience that was creating both non-CAT as well as CAT weather, there was oftentimes a lot of hail with that and when the hail manifested itself, usually it was several months later and some cases even longer periods of time than that, and particularly last year what we saw when we had storm activity was first of all, an expectation on our part that the hail development would continue as we had been seeing it, and in fact what turned out to be the case was there was very little hail emersion, if you will, that came about. ","So there\u2019s nothing really different about the way we\u2019re reserving, but it\u2019s just using the facts and circumstances that emerge over time to come up with the best estimates and then revise those when new information comes up.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got you. Great, thanks. I guess the other question I\u2019m talking about, really focusing on the lowest performing cohort and taking as much rate as you can there. Brian, it seems that that\u2019s also been a philosophy that\u2019s been in place for a little while. How much more do you think opportunity there is in that cohort to continue to push for right-sized rate? How long will it take to push that cohort into the good bucket? Thanks.","Brian McLean","Yeah, so a couple points in there. When you look at that cohort, we will continue to move stuff up\u2014we don\u2019t have the crystal ball to know exactly when and what we\u2019ll be able to do going forward. When we look at the results that we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters, we are encouraged that we don\u2019t see any change, so we continue to work it account-by-account. ","You know, one of the things\u2014you started with we kind of get as much as we can. The philosophy is a little different than that. We\u2019re looking at these\u2014in every cohort, there\u2019s always a distribution of accounts. We\u2019re looking account by account within that cohort. We\u2019re trying to work with the customer and with the agent to come up with what\u2019s the appropriate number for that account. In aggregate, we\u2019ve been able to maintain at about that 20% rate increase level, but there\u2019s a distribution of accounts within there, so we\u2019ll continue to work at it.","There will always be new business that we\u2019ll write that will\u2014you know, we don\u2019t write new business planning for it to be in cohort five, but there will be some that will end up there. There will be other accounts that will have loss experience that will have them deterioriate and they\u2019ll go down into cohort five; but as you can see from the data we showed, it is continuing to shrink so it will never get to zero. But right now, we feel pretty good that we are still able to take the actions we need to take on the accounts in that cohort, and where we can we\u2019re happy to retain the business, and where we can\u2019t we lose some of it.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. That helps. Thank you very much.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Thank you. The first question I had is on the merger and acquisition environment, and clearly we\u2019ve seen a more hostile environment emerge in Bermuda. I know that\u2019s not at all a focus area for Travelers, but Jay, I was wondering if you\u2019d focus on the M&A environment currently and whether you might be interested in more bolt-on deals like the Dominion opportunity, or perhaps even something more transformational.","Jay Fishman","Sure, Jay. We don\u2019t compete in the reinsurance arena at all, actually, so I don\u2019t have any particular insight into that segment or the dynamics around it. You all understand that, have a different view of that than I ever could, so I\u2019ll leave that to your commentary.","Our own situation is really unchanged, which is that we\u2019ll look at anything because you always learn by whatever you look at, but our interest is very selective. We\u2019ve achieved a level of performance and returns and profitability that we at least domestically don\u2019t need to be any bigger to be successful. If we can be and continue to be successful, that\u2019s fine. Being bigger and being less successful is a bad trade-off, so we\u2019re always evaluating whatever we look at in the context of return on invested capital \u2013 on invested capital, importantly. It\u2019s margins, profitability, all that, so I\u2019d say that our interest domestically remains unchanged but relatively highly selective.","We\u2019ve always said that there were a few environments outside the United States that from a long-term perspective we were quite interested in. Brazil was one of them and we had the opportunity to partner with the Malucelli firm, and that transaction has gone just really well. In the context of a joint venture where so many things can go wrong, so many things in this one have gone right, and it\u2019s really been a terrific experience. It\u2019s actually reinvigorated my belief that you can actually do a joint venture and have both parties feel good about it and be successful and do good business.","Canada was opportunistic in that there were very few acquisition candidates that were really available. This was a decision by the owner of Dominion to exit the business strategically. We were approached with a very small number of other people, and it moved us, as I commented before, I think the numbers were from 21st largest in Canada to now the 10th largest, but at 21st you\u2019re not sustainable. It really becomes difficult to hire talented people, to invest in systems and infrastructure. I don\u2019t mean to say that the people who worked for Travelers of Canada were not talented \u2013 they obviously were. It just puts a stress on the organization, so having the opportunity to acquire Dominion, and then most importantly \u2013 most importantly \u2013 there were two elements of it that were intriguing to us. ","First, we thought they were on the right path to doing the right things to make their own business more profitable. We thought we could accelerate the time frame, that our skills, size and scale, and our experience that we\u2019ve had could accelerate that. And then, the more intermediate and longer term aspect of taking our commercial products, exporting them up into Canada and using Dominion\u2019s remarkable distribution organization to leverage, that remains just right clear in focus. It\u2019s just so important for us to do. ","I\u2019ve expressed before, although I\u2019m less optimistic that it will happen\u2014you know, I\u2019d love to find us in India in some way. The challenge there is that it takes a tremendous amount of time and investment \u2013 not dollars, because it\u2019s a relatively small market, time and investment in people and infrastructure, management attention for a 26% ownership, and it\u2019s difficult to make sense of that. If we had a higher degree of confidence that that regulatory prohibition would be lifted and it would become 49%, we\u2019d be more aggressive. There are certainly plenty of partners in India who have raised their hand and have expressed interest in partnering with us, so the identification of a partner is not the issue. The issue is making real sense of an investment longer term.","You know, we\u2019re a P&C company \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be. There may be other environments that will pop up and we\u2019ll take a look at. Continental Europe broadly is over-insured and under-returned, and doesn\u2019t hold a lot of excitement for us, so it\u2019s going to be case-by-case. We hope to use the venture in Brazil to look at other South American opportunities, so we\u2019ll continue to find those spots where we think that our skills, the attributes, the partner\u2019s ability to bring value to the transaction makes sense, and we\u2019ll invest in it. So that\u2019s as comprehensive an answer as I can give you.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","It\u2019s very comprehensive \u2013 thank you. And then just on capital management, with the increase in the dividend and the strong level of retained earnings, any thoughts as to whether Travelers could increase the combined share buyback and dividend to be more than an annual level of operating income going forward?","Jay Benet","Well, the basis upon which the capital management starts is with the operating company capital, so to the extent that you\u2019re making\u2014your earnings are creating capital that you don\u2019t need, that is the basis for the share buybacks and the dividends. We\u2019re always looking at other things that will free up capital. You might recall from a couple of years ago, we mentioned that we had reductions in the amount of reinsurance recoverables we had, or there was a sale of a runoff business, that both freed up capital. So we look for those kinds of opportunities, but those are things that may or not happen. The real juice, the real underlying current that gives rise to the ability to return capital, that\u2019s the earnings. ","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Great, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Good morning and congratulations on a great quarter. So first, just a question of the numbers and how we should think about them. Last year you guys ran, I think, over a 15% ROE; this quarter was nearly 18%, and the accident year ROE that you mentioned earlier, I think rounds up to 15. I know we all need to normalize for many things, as I think you guys do internally; but when you think about where you are, what should we think of as sort of where you are in your core run rate ROE, and how far really are you from the mid-teens ROE target that you have over time? I mean, are we there, and if not, how much\u2014if you sort of bring this back to the point, how much more rate momentum do you think you would need to get us to that target?","Jay Fishman","Josh, it\u2019s Jay Fishman. We\u2019re not there \u2013 most definitively, we\u2019re not there. In order to achieve our goal, and it\u2019s not vague by intention, it\u2019s vague because our business is simply not as precise as some people tend to think. This mid-teens ROE over time, to achieve that, you\u2019re going to have to achieve periods of time where you exceed mid-teens, because there will be good weather, there will be bad weather, and that\u2019s going to move back and forth. So we still have to make progress, so there\u2019s no particular change in our approach, our philosophy, what we\u2019re trying to achieve.","Jay will tell you that if you take out the workers\u2019 comp assessment change, that impacts ROE by \u2013 was it 90 basis points or something? By something like 90 basis points, so you can take the 14.6 and you can make it\u2014you know, there are so many moving parts and so many unusual\u2014unusual? Every quarter has unusual pluses and unusual minuses, and they just keep washing out over time.","We have more to do if we\u2019re going to get back on track. At this level of interest rate, I\u2019m still not 100% convinced that it is achievable in today\u2019s environment. We said several quarters ago \u2013 I\u2019ll reiterate it today \u2013 it remains an aspirational goal. I think that it\u2019s critical in an organization to express a strategic goal, and absent something fundamentally changing that\u2019s permanent, sticking with it. It\u2019s not just words that we use here in a webcast; it\u2019s embedded in the systems by which we price product, it\u2019s embedded in the systems by which we evaluate risk selection. It\u2019s what people in the field, underwriters, understand their mission to be, so we don\u2019t mess with it lightly. We leave it as is because it takes so long to get the DNA of an organization to reflect these strategic initiatives.","We\u2019ve got two things going on: interest rates remain at overall historical lows, and the weather patterns are simply less predictable than they were. Both of those remain, and we are not yet at the pricing level, so we\u2019re going to keep going. I don\u2019t know exactly how to quantify it \u2013 I really don\u2019t. I\u2019m not holding back. I don\u2019t know how to quantify X-points of rate in various businesses and various product lines and help you\u2014I wish we had that kind of granular understanding about returns and losses and the rest. I just don\u2019t know how to do it. I just know that as I look at each quarter and analyze it and break it down, we\u2019re still not there yet.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","That\u2019s helpful. This is going to seem like a non sequitur in a way because you\u2019re still raising pricing, but if we\u2019re all sort of looking forward and trying to look maybe six months out again, so what we\u2019ll be talking about in six months and things like that. The question if I ask you sort of a bigger question, Jay, this used to be a boom and bust sector, and I think you called\u2014you know, among the first to sort of get the post-cycle idea out into the discussion three or four years ago, and no one believed you. But with improvements in data analytics and more responsible behavior across the board, we\u2019ve seen three years of pricing firming, so everybody is starting to dust off questions as pricing slows, look back at history and sort of what does history tell us. Last time we saw pricing start to slow, there was seven years of price cutting and a 40% decline in commercial lines. It was obviously a different story \u2013 you know, the backdrop was very different; but I\u2019m wondering as you guys sort of put your strategic planning hats on and you think about the market, can you help us think about what here has been structurally changed? If we were to put on a three to five-year view, what do you think we\u2019ll see if we move decisively past the firming part of the cycle?","Jay Fishman","Sure, and I\u2019ll start off by saying we could be wrong. Just because we believe it and manage our business that way, doesn\u2019t by definition mean it will be right. It\u2019s entirely possible that we just don\u2019t see it right, and it\u2019s important because otherwise you always have to consider the prospect of what if you\u2019re wrong.","We\u2019ve been talking about much less amplitude in the cyclicality of our business for a lot more than three to five years. I think you can go back almost 10, certainly 8 where it began to get increasingly clear to us that the factors that we thought had contributed to that remarkable cyclicality were being moderated. They were much better data. I know that we led that effort because of our history, but we\u2019re not unique in the sense of one and only in that regard \u2013 better data, better analytics broadly across the business and the industry, particularly amongst the best competitors.","I think that Sarbanes Oxley actually had a meaningful impact on our business. It brought boards of directors into the discussions of reserve setting and the controls and procedures behind it. Those were really good things not because they changed bad behavior, because you can presume that in my comment \u2013 I don\u2019t mean it that way \u2013 but it improved the processes. It\u2019s fundamentally improved the processes by which managements are held accountable, which boards embrace. That\u2019s a big deal. That was a meaningful change in our industry that I don\u2019t think a lot of people really understood, and I believe that now.","So now, I\u2019ll tell you\u2014at least this is a Travelers\u2019 view. I\u2019m not speaking for anybody else, but I will tell you for us, the question that we get asked probably more than any other, which we just scratch our heads about, is now that returns are where you want them to be, why don\u2019t you grow? And talk about a non sequitur question \u2013 it\u2019s one that we so struggle to understand. There is a presumption in that question that we can moderate our rate gains on the margin and somehow grow our business and change behavior. First of all, I don\u2019t how to moderate thousands of transactions in any given quarter one at a time and move it on the margin. We give our folks tools, we give them processes, we give them goals, and we let them manage it; and the numbers in the end, end up the way they end up. We also don\u2019t believe that you can on the margin grow your business by cutting price marginally. I think \u2013 we think that\u2019s just a fool\u2019s approach to the business.","If you really want to use price as that type of a competitive approach, you\u2019ve got to cut it to the point where you\u2019ll accept materially lower returns than anybody else. That will change it, and my guess is it will be at a level of profit that is simply unsupportable for the long term. So we at least, we reject the notion that you can moderate pricing to grow your business. ","Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that we are free from that obligation. We try really hard to grow our businesses, and in many cases we\u2019ve been extremely successful. It\u2019s not been based on price; it\u2019s been based on risk selection \u2013 importantly, identifying the competitive advantages that you have in your business and applying them more broadly to business opportunities that arise. We had the best national accounts workers\u2019 comp business there was, and lots of you have been exposed to that and you understand the competitive dynamics that exist and the advantages we bring. Once we decided that we could apply that expertise to the small commercial business, we were able to grow that segment in small commercial meaningfully \u2013 really meaningfully, and it mattered. ","In our middle market business when we decided to get much more specific and program-driven, less generalist, we\u2019ve actually been able to grow the premiums from going back to \u201905 a little over $2 billion to now a little over $3 billion in that business \u2013 real growth not by price, because in that period of time largely price has either been flat or its increased, but by identifying segments of risk \u2013 risk return where the return trade-off was worthwhile and it made sense for us to apply those competitive advantages.","So we\u2019re not\u2014we may get dragged into it. Maybe there will be other competitors that will be willing to accept sub-par returns at a level that at some point force everybody to respond \u2013 that was the old days. I think the industry is smarter than that \u2013 I may be wrong, but I think it is. We\u2019re running our business with that in mind, and I\u2019m hopeful \u2013 hopeful \u2013 that that will convert into a financial services business, an industry in P&C that looks more like so many others \u2013 greater consistency, less volatility. That level of volatility is in no one\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not even in the customers\u2019 interest. It\u2019s in nobody\u2019s interest. Consistency of risk management and its costs are important economically, and I\u2019m hopeful that we will get there. But ultimately, every company makes its own decision, every company pursues its own strategy, so all I\u2019m expressing to you is ours, recognizing that we could be wrong. ","But that\u2019s my view of why things are different, our view of why things are different today than they were perhaps 20 years ago.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","That\u2019s really helpful, Jay, thank you. Thanks, and good luck.","Jay Fishman","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Hi, good morning. The first question is on the accident year loss ratio ex-CAT for the business insurance segment. We had some very small improvement, maybe around 20 basis points of year-over-year improvement in that segment, and I understand there is some non-CAT weather. But if you could help me understand how you look at these numbers, that would be helpful, given that pricing is in excess of lost cost trends. Thanks. ","","Brian McLean","","I lost track of the numbers you were doing, so you were looking at ex-CAT accident year\u2014","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Loss ratio, so that\u2019s about 60.2 points this quarter versus 60.4 points last year\u2019s first quarter, so that\u2019s a small improvement. Most of the improvement on the accident year combined ratio came from the expense ratio \u2013 I believe 150 basis points after the workers\u2019 comp. So since you\u2019re setting pricing in excess of loss cost, I would have thought that the loss ratio would have had more significant improvement.","Brian McLean","Yeah, okay. Jay\u2019s got the numbers, so\u2014","Jay Benet","Yeah, without getting into the specifics of it, yes is how we react to it. I mean, the way we react is we obviously have some very specific views as to what the components of the changes are, so in blowing apart that 20 basis points, we look at what is the impact of rate earned in versus loss trend, right, and how does that compare to prior quarters and are the trends that we had been seeing inherent in this number that we\u2019re seeing here. The answer to that is yes. ","We continue to earn in rate in excess of loss trends, and then the next obvious question is well, okay, if that\u2019s the case, how come it\u2019s not showing up? As you had said, this is a quarter where the weather has on a non-CAT basis as well as a CAT basis in an area like business insurance been much more of an impact than it was in the first quarter of last year. When you think about the weather this particular quarter with the winter storms, one of the questions that we had been mulling over here was if you look at the relationship of weather-related losses in BI versus PI, personal insurance, while it had weather events this quarter, they really kind of looked not all that dissimilar from where they had been in the prior year, and in the case of BI they were much higher both in terms of CAT and non-CAT. In looking further at that, we find that in business insurance, you\u2019re dealing with insureds that have many more flat roofs that when there are ice storms and snowstorms sustain more damage than sloped roofs and homes that people own, and then secondarily you have a lot of sprinkler systems in businesses and when sprinkler systems freeze and then water damage results, the damage is extensive, much more so than the homeowners business.","So in pulling all these things apart, we look at the data, we look at the relationships, we look at the causality and see that it all makes sense to us, and in this particular case what you are seeing are the 20 basis points of improvement, but it is really the rate in excess of loss trend benefit being offset in large measure by the weather.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","That\u2019s helpful. Just as a follow-up to that, we\u2019ve seen the expense ratio improve meaningfully. In this segment, that\u2019s the business insurance segment and the other segments. Curious as to whether this is repeatable and whether this is a function of management action because you feel the pace of rate increases are now starting to moderate. Thanks.","Jay Benet","Yeah, there\u2019s a combination of stories here. First of all, in business insurance, business insurance is where the benefit that we called out in the press release relating to the workers\u2019 comp assessments is coming through, so that\u2019s the lion\u2019s share of what\u2019s taking place here. We continue to manage expenses very, very carefully in business insurance, and we are getting some benefit of expense leverage here that is also contributing to the reduction that you\u2019re seeing. But the primary driver in business insurance was the reevaluation of the estimated liability that we called out.","In other areas, we have changes in commission rates that we\u2019ve talked about that have come through, also the expense saves that we talked about in PI. So there\u2019s lots of different stories, but it all goes back in most cases to a very diligent view as to how to manage expenses in those plays.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Helpful, thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie ","Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Two quick questions. The first question is on loss cost trends in business insurance. Maybe using California comp as a backdrop, has anything changed in terms of loss cost trends when you look at Q1 versus Q4?","Brian McLean","This is Brian. The short answer is no. Your comment of taking California comp as a backdrop, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever use California comp as a standard for things broadly across the book of business. So in our comp business and the other lines, really no significant movements at all this quarter from what we have been seeing historically.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","I can see now I was unclear. I was alluding to SB863 and its impact. ","Brian McLean","Yeah, specifically in California?","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Yes.","Brian McLean","You know\u2014yeah, I don\u2019t think we want to go that granular in talking about specific trends. I mean, we\u2019ve got a decent-sized book in California and continue to manage it on a granular basis and feel good about it, but\u2014yeah. Everything, all those changes are reflected in the results that we\u2019ve got in our book, so we would prefer not to delve that deeply into one state\u2019s specific actions.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. I guess sort of switching gears and going back to the discussion on Quantum 2.0, it\u2019s in 28 states right now. What I was trying to get at was how should we sort of think about the impact it might be having on premiums right now, i.e. is there some way to sort of segregate the impact when we look at the numbers?","Jay Fishman","It\u2019s Jay Fishman. In the aggregate, no. Were we to dive into the individual states where the product has been rolled out, what you would see \u2013 I\u2019m trying to recall \u2013 almost universally, maybe that\u2019s not exactly so, but you would see a meaningful increase in new business in each of those states. Because it\u2019s only been out for a few months and it\u2019s only still out in 28 states and the DofC, there is still some time to go before it evidences itself in our numbers. ","I think the best that I could provide to you\u2014this is not a budget, I want to make it clear. It\u2019s not a budget; it is to some extent a guess on our part, and of course competitive reaction can change all of this. Our guess is that if we keep going at the pace and things remain as unchanged as they are now, that by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year, we will achieve break-even status, meaning that in the fourth quarter the book will no longer be shrinking. So it will shrink again in the second quarter, it will shrink again in the third. By the time we get to the fourth, we should be able to hit break-even, and that gives you, I think, a sense of its intermediate term impact on a book of our size.","Remember that it\u2019s all new is coming out on 2.0. Dual is at the agent\u2019s discretion based upon the individual customer\u2019s need, and I\u2019m being reminded her by everybody that in my comment about the fourth quarter is that that\u2019s policies in force, not premium dollars. Policies in force should, we hope given everything we see, we\u2019d project to flatten out in the fourth quarter.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Got it. That is extremely helpful. ","Gabriella Nawi","Sorry \u2013 this is Gabi. Just to remind you that you can also see on Page 18 of the webcast that new business in auto has picked up pretty meaningfully, and that\u2019s obviously largely driven by Quantum 2.0.","Jay Fishman","Totally driven.","Gabriella Nawi","Totally driven.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks for the answer.","Gabriella Nawi","Okay. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Two questions. The first is in the management liability business, we see an increase\u2014an acceleration, I should say, of the price increase. I guess I\u2019m a little surprised by that. I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s happening in that business. And then secondly related to Canada and Dominion, are you able to take capital out of that business now, and if not, when will you be able to?","Alan Schnitzer","Jay, it\u2019s Alan Schnitzer. Let me start with the first one and then I\u2019ll turn the second one over to Jay. In management liability, what you\u2019re seeing there is our peak seasonal price change. That\u2019s got two components \u2013 one is rate and one is exposure, so the rate underlying that sequentially in quarters would be pretty consistent, up slightly but I would call it consistent with the prior quarter. What you see in addition to that, though, is exposure, and that\u2019s us being able to improve our position in some accounts that have been performing well, and in some cases from an excess position to a primary layer, and then just an improvement in ratable. So it\u2019s really those two pieces that you\u2019re seeing there.","Gabriella Nawi","Sorry \u2013 it\u2019s Gabi. Just to clarify, it\u2019s renewal premium change on the page in the webcast, not renewal price change.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it.","Jay Benet","As it relates to your question about the capital position and taking capital out of Canada, the first and foremost is looking at the opportunity that we have with Dominion to both integrate it, get it into the Travelers in as seamless a fashion as we can, and then take advantage of the business opportunities up in Canada. So we will maintain a capital base in Canada that will support those business activities, and your question is a good one but it\u2019s complicated by both profitability and growth, and we\u2019ll just manage it very carefully up there.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR. Please go ahead.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR","Great, thanks. On the change in the SMA liability for workers\u2019 comp state assessments, could you clarify what states that applies to and what exactly changed in the nature of that assessment?","Jay Benet","Yeah, this is Jay Benet again. The state is New York State, and New York has been going through some rethinking of how they manage things associated with workers\u2019 comp. You might recall from last year, I think it was in the first quarter, maybe the second\u2014the first? We had had a change in the way certain reopened workers\u2019 comp claims were funded, and that actually had a cost to us last year that went through prior year development. What New York State has done recently is change the way they fund the workers\u2019 comp bureaus in New York, and effective 1\/1 of this year instead of doing something that they had done historically \u2013 and without getting into all the complications associated with it \u2013 we had, along with others, charged policyholders surcharges in particular years and then collected those. That was the basis upon which we were supposed to be funding at a later time what the costs were that we were being assessed by New York State for operating their various bureaus. There was a disjoint, frankly, between what our surcharges were and what we were actually assessed by the State of New York, and at times we saw that assessment being higher than what we had collected and that caused us to look at our obligations for that and build up an estimated liability associated with that.","When New York State changed the law effective 1\/1, it didn\u2019t change the surcharges we had collected; in fact, there was a true-up period where you looked back four years from that date, you looked at what you assessed in that time frame\u2014I\u2019m sorry, what the surcharges were in the time frame, what you had paid, and then settled up with New York. And we paid that, but what it did was it eliminated going forward this uncertainty as to a breakage, if you will, between the surcharges and the assessment. So this estimated liability for that breakage in effect was what we no longer required, and going forward the matching of the surcharges and the payments to New York State will be something that will be very definable, so there\u2019s really no need for this estimated liability anymore. It\u2019s a one-time thing. It\u2019s a true-up, and it\u2019s not something that will recur. ","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR","And it transfers to the expense ratio rather than the loss ratio because it\u2019s more of a pay-as-you-go?","Jay Benet","No, it\u2019s goes through taxes, licenses and fees. It\u2019s just the way statutory accounting works. ","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR","Okay. Understood. I guess the follow-up there is that everything you described is more procedural, but has there been any other kind of reform or structural change to the way New York approaches that second injury fund?","Jay Benet","Nothing this year. Like I said, last year there was a change\u2014","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR","Nothing like an SB863 in California? Nothing to fix the real problem \u2013 this is more just procedural on how it operates?","Jay Benet","This is procedural as to how the funding of this particular element operates, yes.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR","Okay, that\u2019s perfect. Thanks.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair","Thanks. Good morning everyone. My question is around workers\u2019 comp. Clearly you\u2019ve been working on that line pretty hard, and the accident year in 2013 came down by several hundred basis points. For this year and next year, can we expect more of a gradual change, or is it possible you could see some more significant improvement also?","Brian McLean","You\u2019re talking about in the combined ratio in the\u2014","Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair","Yeah, in the workers\u2019 comp.","Brian McLean","It\u2019s tough to forecast what we\u2019re going to see. I mean, I think we feel great about our comp experience and the capabilities we have and the risk selection we\u2019ve gone through, and feel confident that we\u2019re appropriately recording the things as we see them today.","Jay Fishman","And our pricing strategies, it\u2019s similar to what we described earlier. Where there are accounts that have been poor performing or under-returned, we\u2019ve been seeking rate gains to improve the profitability, and ultimately that will evidence itself in the numbers. So I\u2019m not\u2014yeah, other than that, do loss costs develop as we contemplate they will, that\u2019s always the variable.","Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair","Okay. And how are medical loss cost trends running?","Brian McLean","Consistent with what our expectations have been. We\u2019re not going to disclose specific numbers there \u2013 I don\u2019t think we have in the past, but we\u2014you know, you can read what\u2019s going on in medical loss cost inflation broadly in society and in the economy, and it\u2019s higher than normal inflation but something that\u2019s consistent. I think for us, one of the things that is really fundamental to our success in this line is literally 20 years ago, we decided we were going to invest heavily in our abilities to manage the medical component of the comp claims, and I think we\u2019ve got clearly industry-leading capabilities there and that really matters for us. So we\u2019re obviously looking at what the trend is on our book, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s different than what other companies are seeing, but it\u2019s clearly been within our expectations and something we watch very, very closely but right now feel good about.","Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair","Okay, thanks a lot.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. This will be our last question. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Larry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital","Thanks. I\u2019ll make it a quick one. I think last quarter, Alan kind of suggested that for SBI to think in terms of 92 underlying combined ratio for this year. The first quarter came in a couple of points better than that, and you guys referenced the management liability treaty as being partly a factor. Does that change that suggested guidance for the year?","Alan Schnitzer","Hi Larry, it\u2019s Alan. No, it doesn\u2019t. So we certainly took that into account when we gave the outlook a quarter ago, so if you look in our 10-Q and you look in the outlook, we really say the same thing about the balance of the year, meaning the next three quarters we expect to be broadly consistent with full-year \u201913. So obviously, we did come in under that in the first quarter, so if you just do the math, that would suggest a slight improvement on the full year. But again, I\u2019d just point you back to the words broadly consistent and tell you that we continue to expect the same.","Larry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital","Okay, great. Thanks.

Welcome to the Third Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Thursday, October 18, 2012. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter 2012 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.","Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.","Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.","And now, Jay Fishman.","Jay S. Fishman","Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we report a very strong third quarter. Net income was $864 million or $2.21 per diluted share, producing a 13.6% return on equity. Operating income was $867 million or $2.22 per diluted share, a record for the quarter for operating income per share. Operating return on equity for the quarter was 15.5%. Our earnings were driven by superior underwriting results, as well as solid investment income.","From an underwriting perspective, we benefited from lower weather-related losses, net favorable prior year reserve development, as well as the cumulative effect of rate gains we have achieved over nearly 2 years.","In Business Insurance, excluding National Accounts, written rate increased to nearly 8% with retention increasing as well to 81%. In Personal Insurance, renewal prices increased in both Auto and Homeowners to 9% and 12%, respectively, while retentions remained stable. Also in Personal Insurance, we continue to execute on improving terms and conditions, along with pricing, and while we are experiencing lower new business volumes, we are taking the right actions in order to improve our profitability and returns.","In FP&II, rate increases continued to improve in our Management Liability businesses, reaching 6% in the quarter while maintaining stable retentions. We continue to be pleased with the execution in each of our segments.","While we are encouraged by the success we are having executing our granular pricing strategy, I'll remind you that it is not just about the headline numbers, that is what is happening underneath the numbers is the real story. Our success is premised on really understanding which accounts or lines are in need of improvement and which ones meet or exceed our expectations.","Brian will take you through Slide 13 in more detail, but the conclusions from this slide are positive. We initially showed you this analysis several quarters ago as an illustration. It is a very summarized look at what we do at a very granular level, and it is also important that you understand that loss ratio performance is only one of the metrics we use to manage our portfolio. And even on this very summarized basis, the analysis demonstrates real progress. It is the package of analytics that we deploy that is illustrated on Slide 13 that gives us the confidence that we will get the right combination of rate and retention on the right accounts that will translate into increased profitability.","As we've said before, we remain committed to taking the steps necessary to improve returns. This means leveraging our data and analytics across all of our businesses to underwrite and price each of our products very thoughtfully. We continue to assume that our operating environment has changed. Notwithstanding the benign weather we saw in the third quarter, Mother Nature seems to be increasingly unpredictable, and we believe the low interest rate environment will continue to impact our business for the foreseeable future. Therefore, we will continue to seek improved pricing and take those underwriting steps necessary to improve profits and produce higher returns on capital. This remains business as usual for us.","And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay S. Benet","Let me begin by echoing Jay's comment, the third quarter operating income of $867 million and operating ROE of 15.5% were very strong, and along with the timing of certain payables, drove extremely strong operating cash flows of $1.5 billion for the quarter.","As Jay indicated, third quarter operating results benefited from a relatively low level of both cat and non-cat weather-related losses when compared to both the prior year quarter and to what we would consider normal for the third quarter, as well as a significant amount of net favorable prior year reserve development. Operating results also continued to benefit from earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends in 2 of our segments, Business Insurance and Financial, Professional & International insurance, as well as a relatively low level of large loss activity. In addition, our investment portfolio had another quarter of solid performance, driven by real estate partnership and hedge fund returns, and the non-fixed income portion and fixed income investment returns that are in line with our expectations.","Another item I would like to mention is that our net favorable prior year reserve development included an addition of $114 million after tax on a net basis to our asbestos reserves. Coincidentally, the same amount added to our asbestos reserves on a net basis in the prior year quarter. On a gross basis, the current quarter's asbestos reserve addition was actually $24 million less than in the prior year quarter.","Although the underlying asbestos environment remains essentially unchanged from recent periods, payment trends have been modestly higher than we had previously anticipated, resulting in a need to modestly add to these reserves.","Turning to financial strength. All of our indicators remain in excellent shape. Holding company liquidity of $2.04 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Our debt-to-total capital ratio now stands at 21.9%, down from 23.4% at the beginning of the year and well within its target range.","Net unrealized investment gains ended the quarter at $5.08 billion before tax, increasing by over $500 million during the quarter, while book value per share rose to $67.81, 9% higher than the beginning of the year and 11% higher than a year ago. And during the quarter, we returned $529 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends of $179 million and common share repurchases of $350 million, bringing our total dollars return to shareholders to $1.57 billion year-to-date.","I should also note that due to the strength of our year-to-date operating results, we have generated more excess capital than we have returned to our shareholder so far this year, which is strictly a matter of timing. Our strategy of returning all excess capital to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and common share repurchases remains unchanged.","As such, we expect that the dollar amount of our common share repurchases during the fourth quarter will be somewhat higher than the $350 million quarterly run rate of share repurchases we have been doing in recent quarters.","With that, let's turn to Brian.","Brian W. MacLean","Thanks, Jay. So very strong results. And from an insurance operations perspective, I believe there are 3 key takeaways that apply across all 3 business segments: First, we're really pleased with the progress we've made on our strategy to improve margin, both in the quarter and year-to-date; second, given the interest rate environment, the weather volatility and loss trend, we need to continue to execute on this strategy; and finally, we see opportunity for better results in those areas of our commercial business that are at the lower end of the return spectrum and in the case of Personal Insurance, where weather losses have been most challenging.","With that, let me go to the specific segment results. Beginning with Business Insurance. Operating income was up 85% year-over-year with catastrophe losses lower and favorable prior year development higher. Excluding these impacts, operating income was $549 million, up nearly 36% from the prior year quarter and the combined ratio improved more than 6 points. The strong results this quarter were driven primarily by earned rate increases in excess of loss cost trends and lower non-cat weather-related losses.","Looking at the production statistics starting on Page 9, we saw renewal premium change, pure rate and retention all increased in the quarter. Renewal premium change was 9.3%; rate, 7.8% and retention was above 81%.","The rate progress that we continued to achieve was broad-based with increases between 6% and 10% across all lines led by Workers' Compensation and Commercial Auto. These increases in pricing, along with the growth in exposures and audit premiums helped to drive net written premiums up 5% year-over-year.","New business was somewhat lower in the quarter as it has been for the last several quarters. Over time, pricing on the new business we've written has improved. But given our strategy to improve margins, we remain very comfortable with the volume tradeoff.","We're obviously pleased with the aggregate production results, but are even more pleased when we look at our execution on a more granular basis. Slide 13 shows our renewal rate change and retention data for Commercial Accounts for both the second and third quarters, segmented by the individual accounts long-term loss ratio.","We have shown you this data before, but are now adding a comparison to last quarter. The bars on the left represent our best-performing business, accounts with long-term loss ratios of less than 60%. And the bars on the right represent our worst-performing business, accounts with long-term loss ratios exceeding 90%.","For context, the bulk of our business is in the less than 60% loss ratio band, while about 15% falls in the greater than 90% band. You can see on the slide that for our best-performing business, rate has held steady while retention improved modestly from the second quarter. In the middle tier, rate improved over 2.5 points while retention increased nearly 5 points. And for our worst-performing business, rate increased over 1 point to 18% while retention improved slightly.","What this data tells us is that we're doing a great job of retaining our best business, improving the profitability of the middle tier and that we have an opportunity to potentially get higher rate increases on our poor performing accounts. So as we've said many times, it's not a one-size-fits-all strategy and you can see that very clearly in this data.","As you evaluate the slide, it emphasizes several points: First, actual pricing and underwriting decisions are made on an individual account basis and include many additional dimensions beyond loss ratio; second, the exhibit presents highly summarized data, and we actually measure and manage our performance on a much more granular level by business, product line, industry and geography; and finally, key to this analysis is our ability to measure returns on allocated capital at the individual account level for these individually underwritten businesses.","Slide 13 focuses on Commercial Accounts, which is our largest individually underwritten middle-market business. But our focused pricing and underwriting approach also applies to our commercial flow business, Select Express, which is the small account end of our Select business. If we were to display the Select Express business in a similar fashion, as we did for Commercial Accounts, you would get a broad array. In terms of loss ratio, the CMP product would be in the middle tier. And similar to the middle tier for Commercial Accounts, we're improving profitability in the case of Select Express with renewal premium change on CMP in the mid-teens.","Our monoline Commercial Auto product within express, which is less than $100 million of written premium, would be at the poorer performing end of the spectrum. And so where our data analytics suggest for the Select Express book, we are focused on underwriting and pricing actions. Again, this is another example of how we apply our powerful analytic tools to drive superior results.","In the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, we once again posted strong results with operating income for the quarter of $180 million. This is down year-over-year due to a lower level of favorable prior year reserve development. In Bond & Financial Products, net written premiums were down just slightly quarter-over-quarter as the continued decrease in surety volumes was partially offset by higher volumes in our Management Liability business, notably in those areas that are producing higher returns.","In Management Liability, renewal rate change, which came in at 6% for the quarter, has increased sequentially in each of the last 5 quarters. It also increased from month to month within the quarter. Management Liability retention was a strong 86% in the quarter.","In International, net written premiums were up 24% or $66 million on a constant currency basis. 1\/3 of that is due to lower surety volumes in Canada and our exit from personal lines in Ireland. Nearly 1\/3 is due to policies that were written last year with terms of around 18 months and so they didn't come up for renewal in the quarter, and a smaller piece or about $12 million is due to disciplined underwriting in our businesses in Lloyd's in Canada. The risk and reward work we've done in international continues to pay off as the underlying loss ratio continues to trend favorably.","In Personal Insurance, results for the quarter benefited from a year-over-year decrease in the level of catastrophe losses along with an increase in favorable prior year reserve development. Excluding cats and PYD, operating income of $190 million was up 23% from the third quarter of 2011. This increase, along with the related improvement in the underlying combined ratio is largely attributable to favorable non-cat weather.","As we seek improved returns in this segment, we are particularly pleased with the significant pricing gains we continue to achieve in both Auto and Home. Auto renewal premium change was 8.7% for the third quarter, up over 3 points from the second quarter, while Homeowners was up over 1 point to 12.4%.","Turning to Auto margins. We've achieved a meaningful written rate increase over the past few quarters which are just beginning to earn in. In terms of loss trend, severity continues to run at mid-single digits, while frequency, when mix adjusted, is about flat. So we're pleased with the progress we've made to this point but see the need to remain disciplined in our pricing strategy going forward.","In Homeowners, the story continues to be about weather. Roughly 60% of our loss dollars in Homeowners are driven by weather. So obviously, frequency and severity trends for this line are also driven by the weather. Because of the volatility in weather, in addition to the 12% renewal premium change that we achieved in the quarter, we continued to aggressively pursue terms and conditions changes that both reduce risk and improve returns.","The rollout of these modifications is ongoing, but our progress to date has been substantial. In the last 12 months, we've made underwriting guideline changes and increased deductibles in more than 40 states. So we feel good about the progress, but we see the need to continue to push these levers going forward.","With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Andre, we are ready to start the Q&A session. And if I could please ask participants to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I was wondering if you could provide a breakout of the reserve release by business line within the commercial line. So the $208 million outside of the A&E, just wondering where that broke out and specially with Worker's Comp, wanting to see if that was net redundant and especially in recent accident years.","Jay S. Benet","Yes, this is Jay Benet. So we look at what's taking price in terms of reserve development in Business Insurance. As we said, it's net about $41 million. And if we look at the components of that property as a big component, if we look at favorable loss development, where did it come from, the recent accident years, 2011, was a big driver of that. And we also had some better salvage and subrogation recoveries in some of the older years than we had expected. Some other areas, CMP, same sort of thing in terms of the property-related items. Worker's comp actually developed a little favorably mostly due to some of the tabular claims that we had for accident years 2010 and prior. We had some strengthening of Commercial Auto given some of the claim severity that we've been seeing in recent accident years that we've been talking about. But net-net, as you saw, everything was on -- was favorable.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And I guess, I mean, did that -- I appreciate the color. I mean, so the Worker's Comp was stable, which is, I think, unique to Travelers. But kind of stepping back, I mean, how should we think about where the reserve trends going overall. For the industry overall, I think, the expectation is that redundancies would diminish. Travelers has had an excellent reserve result. But as this goes forward, should we think of this redundancy as winding down?","Jay S. Fishman","We don't make any predictions whatsoever about where our reserve development is going. We make our best estimate every quarter and we stand by that. And then, as the data develops, as more information comes in, we adjust the reserves accordingly.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And just one more on comp and then the accident year '11, was there -- was that also favorable or was that deficient?","Jay S. Fishman","In the quarter, it was essentially breakeven. It was a tiny bit -- we had a tiny bit of strengthening in the 2011 accident year in the third quarter. It was under $10 million. So this is kind of the quarterly analysis that we do to get things right and effectively given the size of the reserves, we're talking about rounding them.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The underlying combined ratio improvement within the BI segment clearly very healthy. Can you provide any color on which lines of business within the segment are exhibiting the most and\/or least margin improvement?","Brian W. MacLean","This is Brian, Mike. I would say it's pretty broad based. As we've said, comp and auto have been getting the most rate increases, but the range across the lines is 6% to 10%. So everybody is getting some significant rate. As Jay Benet just mentioned, Auto is one of the lines we're seeing a little more heat, so we need the rate there. But I think that by and large, it's been really across the board with our products.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. In terms of -- if you're getting -- what kind of rate increase are we getting in commercial auto then? Because it seems like we've been -- it feels like you guys have been getting healthy rate increases for a while now and you're still talking about margins not being that great in that line.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. I think about 9. Yes, 9 points in auto and comp was around 10, so those were at the top end of the spectrum. Which I think it's consistent with what we've shown in the past. We've talked about and others have talked about the bodily injury trends in the auto business, both commercial And Personal. And so that's been one of the reasons why we're getting those increases.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up in regards to rate increases across all of the segments. Is there a dynamic of stronger momentum in some of the longer tail lines that are more impacted by the low interest rate environment? And are you at all surprised at how well retention is holding up in the face of the rate increases?","Brian W. MacLean","I don't think there's any -- yes, obviously, as anybody looks at the economics of the product, the longer tail lines which would be more significantly impacted by the investment yields, that factors into how we think about it. I'm not sure it factors into how the customers think about it, so we work at it. And on the retention thing, I would go back to our comments on Slide 13. So we're obviously pleased that aggregate retention is going up, but it's really the texture underneath that we obsess about and are we keeping the right accounts. So honestly, I'm not really surprised that we've been able to execute in a way where we're keeping the best business. And...","Jay S. Fishman","And certainly -- it's Jay Fishman. And while the interest rate environment certainly plays a meaningful role in the evaluation, it is just one factor. And I'd make an observation that our Worker's Comp portfolio, broadly, and of course you can get different conclusions in different businesses, but broadly speaking, has actually been doing better. I'm not sure, Brian, how you might characterize it, better than what we perceive the rest of the industry to be or it just hasn't been -- it hasn't been in a situation where the rate need there has been enormous. I'm not sure how to exactly characterize it. But we're starting from -- we're starting from a position in Worker's Comp that was not as problematic as, I think, sort of conventional wisdom might have thought.","Brian W. MacLean","Well, you can look at our line results for a good number of years, and our performance in Worker's Comp has been significantly better than the industry. We think that's due to a lot of things. Risk selection. We think our claim model around medical management is the best in the business and all that stuff really matters.","Jay S. Fishman","Well, Gabby hosted an Analyst Day where there was a considerable amount of time spent in the nuts and bolts of Worker's Compensation management. And really, I think demonstrated clearly, or at least attempted to demonstrate clearly, the real competitive advantages that we bring to the Worker's Compensation line. So again, it's not that we're -- we are just not all in the same situation or the same environment. And so I'd resist the temptation to just leap to the conclusion that long really needs help and short doesn't. It's just more -- unfortunately, more complicated than that.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I agree that you guys did demonstrate very well that you have guys have a best-in-class Worker's Comp business at Travelers at the Investor Day.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","You guys have done a great job of taking rates pretty significantly. Just curious what you're seeing so far in the fourth quarter? And the reason I asked is because, you've taken rate starting fourth quarter of last year. So I just wanted to see if you're successful in getting significant rate on rate.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, Vinay, this is Brian. Let me take a shot and I'll start with, we say it all the time, but we're not prognosticators here. We're not going to guess at what's going to happen in the future. I'd point to 2 things. Number one is what we saw in the third quarter, we were encouraged by. So the results that we were able to post, the texture underneath the results, and the dynamic and the feedback that we've gotten from our agents and our customers. Anecdotally, as we look at what we're working on in the fourth quarter, because we've obviously got some view of that but it's anecdotal, is similarly encouraging. So we continue to see a little bit of progress here. And at the end of the day, whether it will be up a little or down a little, we don't know. But the anecdotes right now feel pretty good. But we're also real cautious. The world can change in 30 days, and we'll see where we are at the end of the next quarter. But that's our mood right now.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. The second question is, how much of a benefit that you guys get from low non-cat weather? I think you mentioned that it was slightly below normal this quarter.","Jay S. Benet","This is Jay Benet. I think, when you take a look at what's taking place in Business Insurance as an example, you see a very strong increase -- I'm sorry, increase in profitability, decrease in the combined ratio. And it's difficult to split out the components on an exact basis, but I would say this, at least, a couple of points in there, where favorable non-cat weather has influenced us. And I think, if you go over to PI, you've got the same kind of result. I don't know if it's couple of points or not, but certainly working its way through and seeing some heads nodding around the table. So I think, a couple of points is probably right.","Jay S. Fishman","But it's a very -- it's truly a guesstimate because you're asking us to compare a level with whatever we thought normal might have been. And I don't know that we know normal compared to anybody else. So it's a challenging question to answer. And again, because you're asking for what was your experience relative to what you thought the experience would be, I don't know if what we thought was the right number to begin with. So that's the complexity.","Brian W. MacLean","Vinay, let me -- it's Brian, let me give you a perspective at what you might be looking for, which is the margin expansion in BI, we think, was about 2.5 points of the combined ratio. So the price over the earned rate over the loss trend dynamics. So -- then the rest has got non-cat weather, it's got other stuff that always -- large loss movement that goes through the quarter, et cetera.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford & Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So in the Q, you seem to be guiding to -- for a continued pricing in the fourth quarter in 2013, and I'm trying not to be redundant in the last question. But we're all trying to figure out how pricing -- how long pricing lasts. And I'm wondering, 2 questions -- well, I'll ask them first and you guys can respond as 1Q. First, when you're actuaries do indication analysis, how much more -- what's the output of that? How much more rate do you think you actually need to get to target accident year, sort of ROEs and target accident year returns? And then separately, Brian, I'd love to just follow up, you made the point about sort of visibility to a pipeline, obviously, you have the sense of what's going on in sort of actual production that you haven't yet reported. But you also obviously have to file rate increases and -- across probably what, 30% or 40% of your business, at least, where that's primarily sort of driving the rates you end up charging. And I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of actually what's in the pipeline and what you think you'll be effective in written rate levels in the fourth quarter or '13 as we look forward.","Jay S. Fishman","Josh, it's Jay Fishman, I'll take the first part of your question. We have not set a goal, a threshold number at which we stop. And it's driven by the fact that the environment remains really unpredictable and somewhat volatile. Not only do you have the weather dynamic, and obviously the interest rates which are -- at least, the interest rate portion is quantifiable. But you've also got the uncertainty of the fiscal cliff and what happens to the economy and all the factors around it. So for the moment, what we've decided to do is to continue to business it -- continue on business as usual, continue to pursue what we're doing because we know that to produce the kind of returns I think investors will come to expect, we need to do more. So that's honestly, as far as we've gone, which is we're going to continue to do this and we'll see how we do. And I have no idea what the competitive environment will be or what will happen to us. It is nonetheless a very competitive environment and remains fragmented. All we can do is tell you what we're intending to do for the next -- for the near-term outlook. I don't even want to go beyond that. All I want to do is to say in the near term, this is what we're going to do and we'll evaluate how successful we are and do the data and analytics continue to show us that we're doing the right things and on the right track. And we just don't have that goal line to say, we're X months away from hitting it. It's just -- we just don't have it, and that's really all we can say on it is business as usual, and we're going to keep going.","Brian W. MacLean","On the filings perspective, you could -- someone could go and pull them. I would say on the personal line side, we don't have any real big filings in the works that are going to change where we are today. So we took a pretty good bump up in Auto and that was because some things kicked in, in different states and so a little bit of steady as she goes there. In Select, we've recently put in some filings, which are just becoming effective. And so we've got some momentum maybe there, and those would be the 2 big places where we've got filed rates.","Jay S. Fishman","Where filings matter. In Commercial Accounts, really it's not a file environment, we're really doing -- wrestling with that. And I'll just kind of revert back to Brian's comment about the anecdotal observations. It's still pretty early in the quarter. And so what we're getting is feedback from our folks in the field who are in agents' offices every day, renewing accounts and having conversations and getting a sense of what the market is. And the anecdotal feedback -- and I wouldn't overemphasize it because it's -- it can change. First of all, it might not be right, it might not be accurate of the real environment and it might change. But the anecdotal feedback that we're getting is -- continues to be so far, so good. And so it's encouraging and gives us a basis for saying, we're going to continue. That's -- it's about as good as we can do right now for you.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So Jay, not -- just to paraphrase, make sure I get it. So basically looking out over your guys' planning horizon, you're not going to give a target, of course. But ultimately, you're going to march to your own drummer, raise pricing, sort of get to continued levels and the market's going to what the market's going to do, but you're going to drive to sort of continued pricing momentum along the lines you've been doing thus far in 2012.","Jay S. Fishman","Well, what I'm -- what we don't want to do is to tell you that with certainty that we're going to succeed because I don't know. It's just -- it's been environment where every company decides its own strategies and has its own conversations with agents and brokers about individual accounts. So all I can tell you with some degree of certainty is in the near-term how we're going to act. That I can tell you because we drive that. How the market responds and how competitors perceive the marketplace and what they do is well beyond our control. The data that we have from the third quarter is encouraging that we're not hitting some wall. The important thing -- the question that I asked definitely here is, are we achieving what we're trying to achieve in the market? A lot of your -- not your questions, particularly, but many of the questions that we get seem to be, are we asking for 20 and getting 8? Or are we asking for 8 and getting 8? And that actually is a relevant question and it really -- we're not trying to get 20. We're not attempting. We've always said from the beginning of this that it was going to be disciplined, thoughtful, account by account, loss driven, evaluated in the context of interest rate changes, thinking about weather, and most importantly, nondisruptive, nondisruptive to our agents and our brokers and our insureds. We're trying to manage a business and relationships. This is not a trading account. It's real people with real businesses, paying real bills and real agents that stand between us, and we're just trying to manage this thoughtfully, gently, doing what we need to do to make sure our business remains viable and has substance to it, but not doing it in the way that causes disruption. So again, I look back at the third quarter, the data all says we're making that happen and gives us a basis for saying, let's keep going.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, one question I have is when you look at your profitability and kind of what you've talked about from here, what do you think is more important or how would you kind of prioritize the rate actions you're taking versus the actions you seem to be taking on the loss management side? And where do you think the industry is on those measures, whether it's terms and conditions or infrastructure to help kind of push down claim cost? And just one follow-up.","Jay S. Fishman","Brian and I are going to split this. I think if you looked at Business Insurance, our strategy is predominantly rate driven. We've always been a company that's been actively engaged, helping our insureds manage and lower their losses. We have a substantial risk management group. They are involved and always have been with our insureds to try and help them manage their losses and do better business for them. So that's -- our dynamic in Business Insurance really price driven, rate driven. In Personal Insurance, underwriting terms and conditions play a much more significant role, and I'm going to let Brian speak to that.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, I mean, and I'd say clearly, personal line heavily on the Homeowners side. And to some degree, more broadly property all around. But the place where terms and conditions are really important is our Homeowners' book. And just to give you a perspective. Industry deductibles in the '70s were typical average $250, maybe a $500 deductible. Now the average is probably a $500 deductible. If we just kind of loss inflate that over the 40 years, we think the average deductible should be somewhere around $2,000. So the product has changed. So we're driving deductibles. We've actually been pretty successful historically in getting deductibles on the coastal hurricane exposed, so that's not the issue. The issue has been the inland tornado, hail exposed and we're making real progress. And so there, that's important. The other dynamic is underwriting, and a lot of that is around roofs. So age and quality of rood is an important underwriting decision now on time reporting, on claims and is different in the policy in a lot of places than it was before. So all of those pieces really matter on the property side.","Jay S. Fishman","And our hope in deductibles, by the way, is not unique to loss mitigation, that's an important part of it. But we also believe that customers shouldn't be buying more insurance than they need, right? Insurance should be to protect for catastrophic events. And we would encourage all insureds to not pay for more insurance than their own capacity to deal with losses would suggest. And so part of this is not, again, not just loss mitigation important, but it's also to make sure that we're doing the right things for our customers even if they don't always see it exactly that way. It's a $500 deductible today becomes a policy that responds to a lost iPad, and it just isn't the way a homeowners policy was really designed to be.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just one question on the directors. I know we haven't talked about it a lot recently. But I mean, it seems they kind of be floating along in terms of premiums are growing a little bit, the drag on, the combined ratio is about flat, looks like 5% to 7% of earnings right now. And what is the strategy there? I mean, it's -- you've kind of been in this state for a little while. At some point, would you look at trying to get -- purchase something to help kind of build that platform? Or is it -- or is building it still kind of the expectation?","Jay S. Fishman","Well, we have been and continue to be in the test-and-learn phase. It's -- and I don't mean test. What I'm talking about is testing in the very specific dynamics of building the business, whether it's how you get customers to respond or how you encourage a high conversion rate from response to quote. And then most importantly, how do you generate sales from quotes, and that gets to not only the technology or interactive behavior at a call center, but also to the pricing structure. And so we're still in the phase of doing what we need to do to gain the learnings necessary to launch, in effect, sometime down the road a successful business. This is not yet launched. We are still in the test-and-learn arena and we have more work to do in that regard. We're going to resist the temptation. We've done it -- I've certainly in the old, old Travelers days, have been involved into one where we launched a program way too early and had a marketing success and a financial disappointment. And that's a real problem. And so we're going to resist the temptation to do this early. There are always young customers coming along. There's -- it's not as if there's a finite group of customers and they're there. And once they have insurance, they're gone. We all get a day older every day, and there's always another group of customers that are emerging, that are getting drivers licenses that become young adults that need to buy insurance. And so as we think about it that way, we're more than willing to be patient and do it right. More important to do it right than to do it quick and fix as we go. So that's where we are.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And to the timeline from here is just kind of as it develops. And do you feel like you're getting the learnings from it to kind of offset the cost that you're investing in it? And I'll stop.","Jay S. Fishman","Well, we're certainly learning whether it offsets the cost or not ultimately depends upon whether we conclude that we have the ability to launch a successful business. I mean if you're asking, do we think that, that's still -- are we still on track to do that? The answer is, yes, but nothing is ever certain. And the real question that we're down to now, as we've said this repeatedly, we are charging the same price in our direct channel that we charge in our agent channel because it is the only price that we know. And the real question is going to be, in that kind of framework, can we actually write a policy, underwrite a risk and produce a reasonable return based on that, whereas, there's some other pricing structure that's going to be necessary? And it's going to take us some time to figure that one out. If we end up concluding that we have everything that's necessary to build a business, yes, we will recover these costs. If it turns out that we ultimately conclude we can't, then unfortunately, we won't. So the substance of your question is, is a challenge to answer, but I -- but we still feel pretty good here. The people working on it are first-rate people. They -- one of the things, and I've said this before, I used to think this was an insurance business. It actually is a lot more about human dynamics and technology management than it is about insurance. And it took a little time for us to even understand that. I think we've got people from outside the insurance industry with real expertise in this arena, and we are learning a lot, really a lot, and we're hopeful is sort of where it stands.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to touch base on 2 items. The first is the exposure growth in Business Insurance. Based on what you sort of see as the forward-looking indicators, to what extent might that pick up over time?","Jay S. Fishman","We're looking at each other here trying to figure out what do we know in the data and what do we see. It's -- first, one of the things we have learned is that notwithstanding the fact that intuitively, we keep thinking that the exposure data is going to turn out to be predictive of the overall economy, and we've spent some time trying to actually link those up and in effect, build an index around it. It's just not nearly as predictive as we might hope. If you look at the data broadly, I think what you would characterize it as is sluggish growth. Now those are words against some numbers, but that's kind of what we see. Now it's -- we should be careful not to confuse the dynamics that we measure in exposure to GDP. We're measuring payroll, we're measuring projected sales, we're measuring trucks on the road, we're measuring real estate square feet. And as we all know, you can have recoveries that have -- jobless recoveries, not my words, words other people have used. And so our data suggests sluggish is what you'd see, but I'd be careful to link that up to a conclusion about GDP. It's not nearly as predictive as we might have hoped.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Next issue, on the return of capital. I think in the past, Travelers has talked about returning, in terms of the combined share buyback and shareholder dividend, having that equal to around 100% of operating income. And I think, on track year-to-date, it's around 75%. So based on the commentary that, that will probably be higher in 4Q versus 3Q, I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you feel confident that could get closer to 100% as we think about next year.","Jay S. Benet","Jay, this is Jay Benet. As we said, we do these things based upon expectations. And thankfully, we have a good problem that our earnings were stronger than our expectations, so we created excess capital. So it really is a matter of timing as to when we repurchase shares. The expectation, as we said, for the fourth quarter is to do something higher than what we've been doing on a run-rate basis for the first 3 quarters. And as we say in our disclosures, there's lots of things that go into that decision. There's capital that we need to support the growth of the business. There's capital that we perhaps need or cash that we need to deal with what's taking place in the funding of our pension plans. I might add that we don't have a very large outstanding pension plan given the history of the company. But when you have interest rates as low as we have today, we want to make sure that the thing is properly funded against the assets. So we'll look in all of that, but at this point, what we could say is that we have created the excess capital beyond what we need at this stage and we haven't bought it back at the same rate, so we will be increasing it. And over time, which I think is really the critical phrase, over time, it will be the earnings that will drive the amount of capital that we return to shareholders, both in the form of dividends, as well as the share repurchases.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. And I just want to clarify a prior response. I think there was a question about pace of rate increases in BI in 4Q. Now you were saying roughly similar to 3Q, and I just want to clarify that, that using the 7.8% rate increase that was in 3Q is sort of the baseline.","Jay S. Fishman","No, no. You've misheard that, I'm afraid. We were asked the question and we said, we don't make predictions and we're certainly not prognosticating on rate gains. What I think Brian said was that the anecdotal feedback and that's all it is, it's not data, it's just anecdotal feedback just suggests so far that the fourth quarter is, so far, is sort of looking the same way the third quarter did. Don't over read that. There's no precision in that comment other than conversation. That's all it is. But if we had heard from people out in the field that something substantive had changed, that there'd been some meaningful difference in the environment, that I think is important. We've not heard that. We just heard, yes, it's about the same. Now it's going to be a matter of what accounts actually come up for renewal, what's the mix, where on that grid do they fall, what lines of business. So no predictions whatsoever. And all we were doing there was providing the anecdotal feedback that fourth quarter is sort of so far, so good. Bill is -- I'm looking at Bill and asking him to nod, yes, and he did. So that's where we are.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One clarifying question was just, I think, it was Brian who said about 250 basis points of kind of core margin improvement year-on-year. And obviously, the last quarter had a bunch of non-cat weather and large losses in it. But I guess, what I was trying to get a sense of was, how was non-cat weather, large loss activity in the current quarter relative to normal? Was that a benefit or not? And if it was, any numbers you could put to it?","Brian W. MacLean","I'm trying to -- so 6% -- if I look at the quarter-to-quarter combined ratio in Business Insurance was improved 6% CapEx, ex-cat, ex-PYD, about 2.5% of that was the earned rate over the loss trend. The next largest piece would have been the non-cat weather which was clearly better, and then we'd had large losses, I think that's the right sequence. I don't have the exact numbers on each of those pieces, but...","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm sorry, I think I confused the issue. I understand on a year-over-year basis why the non-cat weather and the large property is a such a big contributor. I guess, I was -- if you look at 3Q of this year, individually, would you characterize non-cat weather and large loss activity as kind of a nonfactor in kind of the way the underlying margin played out? Or was there any benefit to speak of? Because you've mentioned in the press release, but I wasn't quite sure if that was just with respect to the year-over-year or there was something -- it was just a reversal of that a year ago or if it actually was also good this quarter.","Jay S. Benet","Yes, the bigger impact was the reversal of bad from a year ago with regard to non-cat weather activity. But as it relates to the current quarter, the current quarter also was very light in weather, whether it was cat or non-cat. So we did have a benefit in the current quarter from what we would otherwise consider to be normal. And as Jay Fishman said before, the consideration on normal has lots and lots of judgment in it. So we're not going to sit here and say, well, it was worth 1 point, 0.5 point or 1 point. But what we can tell you is that the weather was benign in the third quarter and our results benefited from that.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then one question just on the construction surety, volumes are in decline. I was curious if you could get a sense -- give us a sense of how much of that is coming from commercial end markets versus residential end markets? And is there anything you see kind of as you look out that potentially could start to dampen that trend?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, this is Brian. I'll flip it to Alan. But we don't do a lot of residential. So...","Alan D. Schnitzer","It's way more driven by municipal finance and municipal construction, so not very much of it would be coming from the residential side.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, but I would assume that...","Jay S. Fishman","Well, we're not active in that market. Our data is largely driven by the municipal arena but it's not because, it's not the -- we don't know what's happening in the residential segment, we're just not a real participant.","Alan D. Schnitzer","But way more of the surety market relates to municipal construction projects where there is a statutory requirement for the surety product. So you don't have the same requirement or the same level of surety premium coming out of residential construction generally.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, I guess, kind of as a pass-through though to the municipal piece, there's always part of that is extending services into new areas, correct? So I guess on -- I'm just -- that was kind of what I was thinking -- asking the question was kind of what I had in mind, completely recognize the comment.","Alan D. Schnitzer","The infrastructure buildings, roads and other utilities to service, development broadly. But I certainly don't have at my fingertips have the breakout between that and say highway construction. I wouldn't have that breakout.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to -- the one disconnect that I'm sort of wrestling with is the top line, in other words, premiums written and earned premiums. The percentage gains year-over-year are just not even close to where rates are at, and retentions look good. So it seems to be coming down to new business. So my first question, I guess, is it new business falloff that's sort of driving the lack of flow through, the actual reported top line? And if it is, I'm sort of wondering why do you think people are choosing not to join Travelers as much as they were before?","Brian W. MacLean","So the short answer is, yes, it is primarily new business. As you pointed out, retentions are down slightly in most of our businesses, but very solid and we feel great about those. We're getting price increases.","Jay S. Fishman","Yes, down slightly from historical norms.","Brian W. MacLean","From historical norms, right. And actually across Business Insurance, for example, the overall retention, on a historical basis, a very strong number. Premium is up because we've got price exposure and audit premiums kicking through there. But across much of our Business Insurance area and clearly in personal lines, as we've executed on our strategy of improving margins and raising prices, the new business marketplace has become more difficult. And...","Jay S. Fishman","I think I'd separate the discussion into Commercial and Personal, because I'm not sure they're nearly as similar to that. But first, just an observation business, low exposure is a part of this 2, low exposure growth. That's talking about the overall, general economy. In Business Insurance, there is a phenomena that's been interesting to us. We have historically tracked a relationship between renewal pricing and new pricing. And in this quarter but also in the second, the spread between for us -- I'm not speaking about a broad market comment here, I'm only speaking about us. The spread between renewal and new that we booked actually narrowed, meaning it was better than historical standards would be. So in the context of the new business that we're taking on, we feel pretty good about it. If there's an opportunity here, if there is, it's making sure that our folks who are working so hard and focused on renewal -- renewal retention and gaining rate, don't ignore the new business opportunity. I don't believe, Greg, and I can't prove it to you, but I don't believe that it's people not choosing, as your words, not choosing to be with Travelers. I think if anything here, it's making sure that our folks have the energy as they go through the renewal process to make sure that they don't miss the opportunities in new that at these pricing levels any way are increasingly attractive. And we are focused on that and suspect that -- if you talk to an underwriter, they will tell you that renewing an account flat in a flat environment is pretty quick and pretty easy. But if you're discussing a rate increase with a broker or an agent on an individual account, it just takes more time. A lot of accounts and a lot more time being absorbed in the renewal arena, and we believe -- can't prove it to you, that we believe that this is mostly an issue of emphasis and effort and attention more than it is some substantive dynamic around new business that's in any way problematic. Can't prove it, but that's what we believe sitting around the table. In the Personal Insurance arena, we think it's different. There, the combination of -- particularly in homeowners, but also in auto, the combination of rate and then in homeowners the change in the deductible strategies that Brian has spoken about has -- we're most certainly leading. Again, that's our observation. We are leading in the market, but responding to what we think are substantive issues, the change in the weather, the other dynamics around it. And for the moment, there are alternatives, there are other companies that are available to new customers that may, in fact, be looking like they are less expensive. You get into the whole deductible dynamic and how much you pay for it. So on the Personal Insurance front, we're watching that carefully. It's almost -- personal, it's almost like where we were in Commercial a year ago, which is we were moving ahead and we were hopeful that we would be able to be successful with the strategy, turned out of course, at least, so far that we have been. In Business Insurance, you've seen -- I'm sorry, in Personal Insurance, you've seen the rate gains come on particularly in the last 2 quarters as the filings have taken hold, and combined with the underwriting and deductible dynamics, we're watching it carefully and seeing if it will be successful in the new arena, but only time will really tell. I hope that's helpful, and it's really a fulsome answer as we can provide.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, that is. And just a quick follow-up then. Turning just to the business side. It sounds like that's a prioritization or a point of emphasis within the organization, deciding in a new business versus retention. I mean, my understanding is a point of retention is -- has a far, far better payback within your P&L than new business. Do the people within your organization get paid sort of the same for retention versus new business? Or in other words, are they agnostic or are they actually pursuing what is -- where the highest payback is in the Travelers' P&L, which is go get rate on the current book?","Jay S. Fishman","Well, we can tell you how they're compensated. I hope that they're reacting consistent with it, but of course, you never know. We don't pay for production, we don't pay for new, we don't pay for renewal, we pay for an overall evaluation of performance, not only at an individual office level but actually right down to an individual underwriter level. The data analytics package, I spoke about earlier, really makes it possible for us to have a very granular conversation with each of the frontline people about how they've done. What you can't do is tell people that you really want to improve profitability, and when they take the right steps, even if that means that they lose an account, that you somehow think that's a bad thing. You have to embrace it and understand that it's a good thing. So the numbers, in and of themselves, of production, if you pay based to that, you can get some, not only unintended consequences, but frankly, it will make it difficult to employ the strategies that you know are right to improve profitability. So our payment process is one of -- let's evaluate what each of them has done in the past 12 months as everybody else in this place is evaluated, and we make the payments accordingly. I do think that -- it is hard being a field person right now. They are juggling lots of accounts, negotiating renewals, driving for rate, having to do the analytics behind all that to make sure that the selections they make are thoughtful and smart. And then you tell them, and by the way, don't forget to make sure that you're following up on new business opportunities. I do believe -- yes, and I can't prove it, but I do believe that it is a matter of emphasis and time management far more than it is pricing out of the marketplace. I have no indication that, that's the case or that there's some substantive dynamic of customers choosing away from us. I don't believe that either.","Operator","This concludes our Q&A session.

Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance.","Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.

We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.","Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website, travelers.com.","With that, Jay Fishman.","Jay Fishman","Thank you, Gabi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. As you have already seen from our release this morning, we closed out this year with record results. We achieved record levels of net income per diluted share for both, the quarter and the full year of $3.11 and $10.70, respectively.","Our return on equity and operating return on equity were also very strong quarter, bringing our full year return on equity to 14.6% and operating return on equity to 15.5%. Just as important is what's behind those numbers.","Across the organization, we couldn't be more pleased with how we have executed on our business strategies, including our approach to the marketplace in domestic business insurance, the introduction of Quantum 12.0 and moving our personal insurance business to be better positioned, the continuing evolution of our international footprint and our exceptional positioning in Bond & Specialty Insurance.","Just as important is our capital management strategy. In 2014, we returned over $4 billion in capital to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks, while still maintaining our significant balance sheet strength.","Reflecting on our performance over the last 10 years, now a decade since the merger, a few things stand out. When we introduced our long-term financial strategy in 2006, that is creating shareholder value by producing superior returns, driven by building meaningful and sustainable competitive advantages, generating top-tier earnings and capital substantially in excess of our growth needs and maintaining a balanced approach to rightsizing capital and growing book value per share over time, we were confident that it has been successful in the broadest sense beyond our expectations.","Over these 10 years, our cumulative operating income has been approximately $31.6 billion and we have reduced our share count by more than 61%, returning $30.7 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and amount exceeding the then market capitalization of the company, and we did this while still making investments that were important for our business and acquisitions that were opportunistic for us along the way.","Consequently, we have produced a very strong average annual operating return on equity of 13.3% over that time. Our shareholders have benefited from superior total returns as shown on Page 4 of the webcast, where you can see the 1, 5 and 10-year performance of travelers compared to other U.S. financial companies. Obviously, we posted top-tier returns, but even looking globally we have identified only a small handful of large financial service companies, whose 10-year performance exceeds ours.","We remain optimistic about our ability to successfully execute these strategies. Our own observation is that the markets in which we do business remained fairly stable. For the last several years, we have shared with you that while we recognize that we could be wrong, we were skeptical of the concept of the old-fashioned severe insurance pricing cycle, where a bell to go off and it would be a few years of very high price increases and then another bell would go off and there would be significant price declines.","Our view was and remains that there are no substantive differences in the way business is conducted that have and we believe will continue to change the characteristics of our markets. We have talked about the stability of the market as evidenced by the high levels of retention, the fact that we are not the only company returning significant amounts of capital as well as the focus of the industry on returns on capital.","Advanced analytics and a more demanding regulatory and oversight environment have also meaningfully contributed. While there will always be changes in pricing both, increases and decreases in response to changes in loss costs, expense , interest rates or changes in real or perceived risk, as there are in many industries, we continue to believe that the amplitude of the cycle has narrowed substantially.","Beyond the insurance market dynamics, we have real confidence that our organizations is well positioned to successfully navigate whatever set of challenges the external environment may throw our way. With our relentless focus on execution, deep and talented management team, highly analytical approach to underwriting and investment risk and a very high respect for our shareholders' capital, we remain well-positioned to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value.","With that let me turn it over to Jay Benet.","Jay Benet","Thank you, Jay. By any measure, our fourth quarter results, record net income per diluted share of $3.11, record operating income per diluted share of $3.07, operating ROE of 17.7% and a combined ratio of 85%, were very strong.","As has been the case all year, these strong results were built on very solid investment and underwriting performance. Within underwriting, we continue to earn rate increases in excess of loss cost trends, which was the driver of 100-basis point improvement in our underlying combined ratio this quarter versus the prior year quarter, while experiencing only a modest level of cap losses and very strong net favorable prior-year reserve development.","Pre-tax cap losses were $41 million in the quarter, down $12 million from last year's fourth quarter and pre-tax net favorable PYD was $351 million, up $92 million. While each of our business segments contributed to the favorable reserve development, it was primarily driven by Bond & Specialty Insurance's as contract surety business for accident years 2012 and prior. By business and international insurances, general liability product line for accident years 2008 through 2012.","As I have been doing in recent period, I would like to provide you with a preliminary view of what our combined 2014 Schedule P is expected to look like when filed on May 1st. On a combined stat basis, for all of our U.S. subs all accident years developed favorably. Looking at the data on a product line, rather than on an accident year basis, all of our major product lines developed favorably in the aggregate across all accident years, except for relatively small amounts of unfavorable development in CMP and in personal auto liability.","CMP developed unfavorably by approximately $68 million pre-tax on a reserve base of approximately $3.5 billion, spread out over several recent accident years. Our personal auto liability developed unfavorably by only $20 million pre-tax on a reserve base of approximately $2 billion, driven by development on a small number of large PIP claims from accident years 2005 and prior.","I should also point out that the personal auto in total; combining liability and [ph] reserved development was essentially a wash as physical damage developed favorably by $18 million pre-tax. We have taken advantage of the recent evolution in aggregate CAT reinsurance products to restructure our CAT cover, further focusing on severe events that on a single or cumulative basis could impact capital.","Effective January 1, we replaced our previous GEN CAT treaties, our $400 million CAT, aggregate excess of lost treaty which expires as scheduled on December 31, and our $400 million GEN CAT treaty, which our reinsurers agreed to terminate early as of that date, with a new aggregate ex-OL treaty that provides coverage for both, single events and accumulation of losses for multiple events. It is a simpler structure that provides $1.5 billion of coverage part of $2 million excess of $3 billion after a $100 million deductible per occurrence. It has a same broad pharaoh and geographic coverage of the former GEN CAT and ex-OL treaties and it positions the coverage layer to provide a significant buffer between earnings and capital.","As an aggregate cover, there is a single limit with no reinstatement provisions, the cost is essentially the same as the previous program, but it provides greater potential recovery after the higher retention. Our Northeast GEN CAT treaty, or CAT bonds, earthquake and international covers remain unchanged and I refer you to Page 21 of the webcast for a brief description of the new treaty.","Another subject I would like to touch upon relates to the recent drop in the price of oil. While this is not the first time that oil is trading at $45 a barrel, it was at today's levels as recently as 2009, we thought it would be helpful to provide you with the information appearing on Page 22 of the webcast, showing how much of our investment portfolio is invested in the low investment grade energy bonds and energy-related equities. As you can see, the sum of these investments is relatively small and we believe the exposure to be quite manageable.","We continue to generate capital well in excess of what is needed to support our businesses and consistent with our strategy, we continue to return very significant amounts of capital to our shareholders. Operating cash flows were in excess of $500 million this quarter, inclusive of a $200 million discretionary contribution we decided to make to our qualified pension plan, bringing total operating cash flows to almost $3.7 billion for the year.","We ended the year with holding company liquidity of almost $1.6 billion after returning almost $1.2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter alone through dividends of $182 million and common share repurchases of a little over $1 billion. For the full-year, we returned almost $4.1 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $735 million and common share repurchases over $3.3 billion.","One final note about share repurchases, since we began in 2006, the average price we paid for our shares was $57.56, approximately 60% of our current stock price. Once again, all of our capital ratios remain at or better than their target levels. Our debt to total capital ratio 21.7% was well within its target range. During the , book value per share increased 1% and adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was also up slightly.","For the full-year book value per share increased 10% and adjusted book value per share increased 7%, while net unrealized investment gains were almost $2 million after tax at the end of the year as compared to $1.3 billion at the beginning of the year.","Now, let me turn things over to Brian MacLean","Brian MacLean","Thanks, Jay. Alan and Doreen are going to go over the individual segment results. Before they do, I want to make a few comments about our business and I will start with a significant progress we have made in personal lines.","Three years ago, we discussed with you that we would be aggressively pursuing improvements in our financial returns in both, auto and homeowners primarily due to weather and auto severity trends. As we close out 2014, we couldn't be more pleased with the progress that we have made. We have taken necessary rate in both, our home and auto products while maintaining strong retention levels and we have tightened underwriting guidelines and made changes to terms and conditions in our homeowners' book.","We also discussed that the increased utilization comparative raters by independent agent had resulted in a need to improve our competitive position in the auto market. To that end, we announced our production initiatives that would support the rollout of our new more competitive auto product Quantum Auto 2.0. We have now achieved our expense reduction goal and Quantum 2.0 is live in virtually all Quantum states.","The impact from these bold actions on our results has been significant. Our homeowners' returns are in line with our target range and our top-line trends are improving. In auto, our returns are operating in a range that is acceptable to us given current market conditions. Importantly, our auto business is growing again and the higher new businesses creating long-term value, so overall, great progress in the independent agent channel.","In the direct-to-consumer business, our decision to enter that channel reflected our belief that a large segment of the personal insurance market empowered by increased transparency of product and pricing information, would choose to buy insurance via the direct channel.","While certain customer segments of this market have quickly embraced the direct channel, the customer demographic that Travelers target has moved more slowly. With that said we remain committed to the strategic channel and expect that over time it will become a more significant portion of our personal business.","It is important to note that as we have invested in this channel, we have consciously targeted that investment to help strengthen our independent agent channel, which we believe, will continue to be a significant channel for our customer demographic, so we feel very good about this investment.","The final point I would make in personal lines is the growing importance of the home product. Our industry is built around protecting consumers against risk, the greater the risk, the greater responsibility and opportunity we have. In that vein, the extreme weather volatility has added risk to the home exposure, making our industry-leading capabilities in the homeowners' line and even more significant competitive advantage and critical with the customer segment we target.","Accordingly, we are continuing to invest to make sure that we maintain and leverage our industry-leading product as a part of a total customer portfolio solution. All-in, we feel great about the progress we have made in this business, we are proud of the many employees that have had a hand in executing these initiatives and we are grateful to our agents who have supported us throughout.","In our commercial businesses, we are equally pleased with our progress, specifically seen in the steady improvement of our product returns which have been the driven by our consistent execution. As Jay Fishman, mentioned in his comments, we are encouraged by the continued stability of the market as evidenced by the strong retention levels we continue to see both, in our book and across the market.","When we analyze our results at a very granular level, we see that we continue to be successful executing our basic pricing strategy which is to retain a high percentage of our business that is meeting target returns, improve profitability where needed, and quote on and write new business that meets our target returns.","You will see in our results that we have had a bit more success last quarter in new business, but I would emphasize that that is a function of the improved returns on accounts we are seeing, and not a change in our appetite for new business. Alan will comment on this further, so overall, great results in 2014 with stable market conditions, very strong underwriting results.","With that I will turn it over to Alan.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you, Brian, and good morning. For business in international insurance, our fourth quarter performance capped off a very good year, with operating income of $630 million in the quarter and more than $2.3 billion for the full-year.","In terms of production results, in the U.S. retention rates increased throughout the year, stable renewal premium change reflecting gradual declines in renewal rate regain and improving exposure. We are very pleased with our execution in the field and I will comment more on that in a minute.","For the full-year, the underlying combined ratio was strong 92.8%, a half-point improvement from the prior year. While earned pricing in excess of loss trend contributed favorably to year 2014 results, there was also negative impact of about 1.5 for non-catastrophe weather and large losses relative to the prior year.","The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 93.9%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. The underlying loss ratio improved 40 basis points driven by the earned impact of price increases exceeding loss trend, partially offset by large losses in non cat weather.","Impact of large losses was about a 0.1 in the quarter, arising out of our international business. We see this as a normal level of large loss volatility. Expense ratio was a little higher year-over-year, due to the effects of some favorable expense items in the prior year quarter.","Turning to production, we had a very strong quarter in PII with net written premiums up over 6% from the prior quarter, driven by our middle market business and inclusion of Dominion for the full quarter. In domestic BI retention increased to 83%, while renewal premium change increased somewhat from recent quarters and new business was up about 6%.","These production results reflect what you have been hearing from us for the last year or so. That is, given the rate gains we have achieved over the past four years more of our business is achieving adequate return, and for those accounts or classes, our primary objective is retention.","Importantly, in our domestic BI business, we are on average still achieving flat to slightly positive written rate gains on our better performing business segment. For the lesser performing segments of our business, we are on average achieving written renewal rate gains in excess of estimated loss trends.","Let me comment on the growth on new business in middle market, both Jay and Brian commented on the stability in the marketplace. As a consequence of that stability, the number of requests for quotes on new business has also been relatively stable. However, given the cumulative impact of rate gains in the market broadly over the past four years, a modestly increasing percentage of the new business request that we did see in the quarter, where return levels that met our threshold. As a result, in the quarter we were able to quote successfully on more accounts. The new business growth in the quarter does not reflect any changes of our return thresholds or more aggressive new business pricing.","Looking at the production statistics, I would like to highlights some further detail. In select, retention was over 80% for the second consecutive quarter, with total renewal premium change of a little over 8%. In middle-market, retention was above 84% for the second consecutive quarter and renewal premium change was strong and increased slightly from the third quarter, a great result.","In our other domestic BI business, we were pleased that both rate and exposure increased from the third quarter, resulting in 100-basis point increase, sequentially, in renewal premium change. Also, our retention increased to 81%, the highest level in more than two years.","Looking at our production results for international, retention was strong at 82%, slightly higher than recent quarters. Renewal premium change was higher than the third quarter as exposures improved. New business was down year-over-year, primarily because the new business we saw did not meet our return threshold.","In December, we were pleased to announce that our joint venture with J. Malucelli in Brazil, agreed to acquire a majority interest in Cardinal, a start-up surety provider in Columbia. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.","To sum it up, we are very pleased with our strong operating income and production results for the fourth quarter and the momentum we feel going into 2015. In terms of execution going forward, we intend to pursue more of the same.","With that, let me turn it over to Doreen.","Doreen Spadorcia","Thank you, Alan. Good morning to all. Bond & Specialty Insurance had a great quarter, rounding out a strong 2014. Both, the fourth quarter and full-year results, are record earnings for the business and we are very pleased with the financial returns in this segment.","For the fourth quarter, operating income was $216 million, 24% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013, while full-year income of $727 million was 27% higher than 2013. The increases from prior year were predominantly driven by the higher levels of favorable prior year reserve development that Jay Benet referenced earlier.","The underlying combined ratio for both, the quarter and full year were strong at 84.1% and 82.2%, respectively. The quarter was slightly higher than 2013, due to a modest re-estimation of prior quarter losses. The full-year result was 2.5 points better than 2013, due primarily to benefits from existing our management liability excess of loss treaty.","While there will always be some ups and downs in the year-over-year variances. I cannot emphasize enough how terrifically feel about the results, in particular the underlying fundamentals of how we achieved them.","As with all of our businesses at Travelers, we remain committed to superior underwriting performance of our portfolios through aggressive management of risk and limits, including enhanced segmentation, underwriting analytics and claims management.","Turning to production, net written premium for the quarter was $525 million, a decrease of 5% compared to the prior year, due to the exit of our management liability excess of loss treaty in the fourth quarter of 2013, which increased that period in net written premium. The non-renewal of this treaty in 2014, together with higher surety volume, drove 4% increase in net written premium for the full-year. Across our management liability businesses, retention of 84% was consistent with recent period in the prior year, while new business premium of $36 million was generally consistent with recent period.","Renewal premium change, which can be somewhat lumpy due to variations in things like limits, written liability, attachment point and policy duration, was 5% for the quarter. In sum, I would like to reiterate one more time just how great we feel about the business and our ability to continue to produce superior financial results.","I will turn now to personal insurance, where I would first like to reiterate Brian's comments about the progress made in the business and how great we feel about our ability to have a vibrant consumer business that generates appropriate returns.","We had a great fourth quarter rounding out a strong 2014. Operating income for the quarter was $242 million, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2013, while underlying income of $254 million was up 18% for the quarter from the prior year, driven by strong underwriting results.","The underlying combined ratio of 84.3% in the quarter was an improvement of 4.5 points from 2013, while the full-year underlying combined ratio was 86.4%, an improvement of about two points from 2013. The improvement in underlying results from '13 for both, the quarter and full year, reflect continued benefits from earned pricing exceeding loss trends and our expense reduction initiatives.","Before addressing the specific results for auto and homeowners, I wanted to give some detail on our expense reduction initiative. You will recall that our plan was to achieve pre-tax savings of $140 million on a run rate basis by 01\/01\/2015, and we are pleased to tell you that we have achieved that goal.","As we have discussed in the past, about half of these reductions relate to claim management expenses, the impact of which shows up in the loss ratio. Since we started the program in the third quarter of 2013, there is about $100 million in cumulative pre-tax savings already in our earnings through the end of 2014. For the remaining $40 million, initiatives have already been executed and they will earn through in 2015.","With this specific initiative met and now behind us, please rest assured that we will continue to manage expenses diligently as we always have.","Looking at agency auto, retention remained strong and consistent at 83%, while renewal premium change was about 5%. Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to drive improvements in production, with new business premium of $161 million in the quarter, 87% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013 and overall net written premiums increased 4% for the quarter. We have also seen increases in policies enforced on a sequential basis for two consecutive quarters now.","Turning to agency auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 97.9%, an improvement of about four points and was 95.9 % for the full-year, an improvement of just over 0.5 for their comparable 2013 period. These improvements were driven by benefits from the expense initiatives and earned pricing exceeding loss trend, partially offset by the higher impact of new business volumes. In addition, the quarter included approximately 2.5 points of favorable prior quarter re-estimation.","Lastly, on auto, our current view of the overall auto loss trend remains at about 3%, with no meaningful change in the underlying texture. Looking at agency, homeowners and other, production was strong in the quarter, with retention stable at 84% and renewal premium change of about 6%.","New business premium of $83 million was up almost 40% from the prior year quarter and we remained focused on maximizing our market leadership position in the homeowners' line to provide broad consumer solution.","From a profitability perspective, the underlying combined ratio of 69% was an improvement of more than 5 points over the fourth quarter of 2013, driven by earned pricing exceeding loss trend and favorable losses including non-cat weather. Overall in personal insurance, a terrific finish to 2014, and we feel great about our momentum heading into 2015.","Finally I would like to echo one of Brian's earlier comments, and this applies to all of our employees, in all of the businesses. We are very proud of the hard work of all of our employees and grateful for the partnership with our agents in achieving these results.","With that I will turn the call back to Gabi.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Tina, we are now ready for Q&A. I would ask you all to please limit yourselves to one question and one follow. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Randy Binner of FBR. Please go ahead.","Randy Binner - FBR","Great. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to touch on the commentary around rate increases now moving below the increase in exposures. I appreciate the commentary that, I think you think you feel like you are getting rate ahead of loss cost and you are more focused on retention there, but a couple of questions.","One, I assume there is going to be competitive profits to keep retention, so any new initiatives there or any more color on how you plan to keep retention higher.","Then, as far as the absolute rate increase number we all watch so closely, I guess, I mean, is by definition we have to see that continue to moderate if you are achieving the rate adequacy.","Jay Fishman","Hi. This is Jay. Alan and I, I think, we will tag team this. First, just to be clear about rate gains, first, I assume you are speaking about our business insurance segment. I think, what Alan said was in our best-performing segments of that business, talking really about the middle-market predominantly, but it goes even beyond that.","In our best-performing business, we continue to experience, let's call it, flat to upper point in terms of rate. Now, relative obviously an overall loss trend for that segment, it is not keeping pace with it. I would tell you that we are not attempting to. That is not our principal focus.","Alan also said that in the poorer performing classes that rate gains there continue to exceed loss trends, so that's where we are. The reason I said we are not uniquely focused on that is that we are a return-driven organization and we ask of folks who have managed this just excellently to remember its agency relationships, its customer relationships and it is how you manage your business over time that matters.","We start off with returns over time, that translates to account management over time, so if an account has had, and I am speaking very, very broadly here, but if account has had three years of increases and they have been a good account and we value them, we tell our people that there's nothing wrong with renewing that flat. It doesn't mean that if there's an opportunity to do a little better because circumstances suggest it, claim activity rising or otherwise, but they should attempt to do it, but that we manage our relationships and returns on accounts over time, so I suspect report, I part that if we are right about the cycle dynamics that you will see more of a stair step in rate gains more than sort of a constant trend line and ultimately I suspect with it the granularity of our discussion our best-performing accounts versus our poorer performing accounts will become more relevant in perhaps the way you see the world.","Now, that's first part.","The second, you spoke about retentions. We are not doing anything differently with respect to retain business than we ever have done and I am sure Alan can give you more color and will, but the way generally business is renewed, if the agent is satisfied, the customer is satisfied, if the market is satisfied, the discussions take place pretty early, well in advance of the renewal date, the account gets resolved at whatever it is and it gets renewed whether it is down a point zero, up a point or differently, so it is [ph] the retention discussions have become as you described more competitive. That simply isn't how the business is done.","Those conversations take place given the data and the analytic we have in the context of long-term account management and doing right thing for the customer the agent for the long-term. I let Alan give some more color on that, but there wasn't anything in the world of retention that we are doing differently.","Alan Schnitzer","Randy, it is Alan Schnitzer. Let me also address both of those quickly. Industry observers tend to focus very narrowly on rate change and the long-term estimated loss trend we give you, and I would remind of comments during the quarter, which is there is a component of price change, which includes exposure that from a return perspective and from margins acts like rate, so we don't look at the narrow GAAP between rate and loss trend may be quite as precisely as industry observers do, and there is always variations quarter-to-quarter in weather and large losses and all those sorts of things that create volatility plus or minus within an expected range, so we are really in a pretty tight band.","In terms of retention, I would have given you the same comments Jay did about our efforts, and I would highlight a real competitive advantage that we have. This is not us needing to do anything else. We have got an extraordinary deal capability, we have got great presence in the field, great tenure in the field, we have got great relationships, we have got great related services like our risk control and it is those sorts of things not developed this month or this quarter, but over many years that give us the ability to manage retention in a way that we think is most productive from a profitability perspective.","Jay Fishman","I would add. Again, that is exactly right. It is not uniquely a price discussion. It is important; it is only one element of long-term relationships and management. Lastly, at least through the third quarter, obviously with the first one out in the PC business this quarter retention is what I would consider all the quality companies they are all high. It is not that we are describing a set of circumstances that are unique for us. We think we manage it better than anybody else and maybe that is sort of our own pride in it, but the fact is that it is not our business that has been stable. It is broadly speaking, the industry's that has been stable and that is what so important.","Randy Binner - FBR","Very helpful. Just one quick follow-up and that is for Jay Fishman on stair step comment on rate. I didn't quite follow how that fit in a conversation, but I think you are saying is the good part of the book becomes more rate adequate. The places where you are trying to seek rate increases may have kind of a bigger impact on a quarterly basis on what we see for rate change. Is that what you meant by the stair step versus the trend?","Jay Fishman","Yes. I did, but the second part of that is that at the account level you may see a year, two years where in an account renew is flat, and then there is an attempt to recover, if you will, some of that loss margin relative to loss trend on that account. We are not a company. We have not issued an edict to the field that says get trend on every account. That would be a dumb thing to do. We say to them manage the long-term return given everything you know about the agent, the account, profile of that account and manage it thoughtfully and if that means that account is going to renew flat for a year or two, that is okay, so that is really the comment about stair step that I was speaking to.","Randy Binner - FBR","All right. Very good. Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb","Thank you and good morning. Jay, I know this is somewhat of a sensitive topic and I hope you are feeling well, most importantly. If you could update us on the health condition that was disclosed several months ago, along with any update in succession plans, that would be helpful initially. Thank you.","Jay Gelb","Sure. I appreciate the question. I have no sensitivity about it by the way, none at all, so first, thank you. I do continue to feel okay. I am here, I am on the job, I am still mobile. It's a little clunkier than it was and everybody here is helpful above and the call of duty and making sure that not only I can continue to do my job, but everybody here can continue to do theirs.","As I disclosed, and someone asked me why did I disclose it, and the answer is because I needed to, to continue to do the job effectively. It was becoming apparent for those who were around me a lot that something was amiss and it was prior leave people in confusion and doubt or provide some clarity with respect to my circumstance. I have chosen not to be specific about the ailment really in respect of my privacy and my family's privacy and just do not think that it really matters a whole lot. Its relevance is I am 62, there isn't anything about my circumstance that causes me to change my view of my ability to continue work here as I did, I have something else to say, so the horizon is unchanged in that regard.","We have been an active succession planning company for a long time and pretty transparently. If you look and see what we have done and what we have announced, it doesn't take a real genius to see what we are doing and what the next generation of leadership here is.","I chuckled where 62 is kind of a magic number here Brian 62, I am 62, Jay Benet,62 Bill Heyman is 60-plus, so it is just that responsibility falls on us to make sure that we do this seamlessly, seamlessly. I would tell you that a board knows virtually everything. I have been completely transparent to them, and to the extent anyone really is interested, I have already begun to cut back fairly meaningfully on my non-travelers commitments and I will continue to do that, so that I can focus exclusively maybe, but there [ph] things are not going to give up, but to focus relentlessly on what matters here, so that's the news of the day.","Jay Gelb","I appreciate that. Thank you. Switching gears for Jay Benet, the capital return in 2014 for Travelers was 112% operating income, including dividends and buybacks. How should we think about that for the years going forward?","Jay Benet","There is really no change in the philosophy, there is no change in what we have said in the 10-Ks and Qs, earnings are going to drive what we are able to return subject to the number of items that we list and contributions being one of them.","When you look at a particular quarter, you are going to see the ebbs and flows of what has taken place in terms of earnings from prior quarters, making the determination as to how much in particular in that quarter we will be able to return to shareholders, so there is no change in philosophy, no change in the kind of basis upon which it is done, all we were seeing is some excess capital actually that we ended the prior year with, working its way into the share repurchases in 2014.","Jay Gelb","Okay. Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Nannizzi","Thanks. Jay Benet, I was wondering if you could follow-up a little bit on the development, maybe give us a little bit more color, maybe the breakdown between surety and GL. I am more interested in GL but on the surety piece how much is the non-renewal of that management liability treaty. How much of the impact of that has already come through.","Then on GL, just trying to some idea on that '08 to '12 accident years, where are the most recent alternates on those books of business as compared to where you are looking in that business today. Thanks.","Jay Benet","I think some of that is a level of granularity. You will probably see when we file the Schedule P. You know we are in the process of summarizing all that data, so to give a very detailed information at this point in time, I think, would be a bit of a mistake. What we are trying to do is, give the overall picture as to how things have developed and in terms of the individual products, the individual accident years, so what we are trying to communicate was yes there was major shift in anything that affected PYD.","As far as your specific question on the surety reinsurance, that has no effect on development. That's a contract that was in place that was looked at in terms of its cost benefit and we decided that it was not really something that was achieving the objectives and from a profitability standpoint and a risk standpoint, we would be better off not having it, but that really had nothing to do with PYD.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. Thanks. Then just on expenses, the ratio in BI kind of dropped in the back half of last year and kind of stayed at that level first part of this year and now we have risen now to 32.5-ish range. Where should we expect to see that? I mean, is that where, you know, I am thinking about whether it is Dominion or something else?","I mean, is there an opportunity to kind of bring that back down to what we were seeing over the trailing 12 months in the second quarter or is that where you expect to efficiently run? Thanks.","Alan Schnitzer","It is Alan again. If you look at the full year expense ratio, I think it was 30, 31.5 and that had a benefit in it from the first quarter that we disclosed then. That was on the year worth about half a point. If you adjust that first quarter event and have that half point again, round numbers that sort of what we feel like would be a fair run rate.","Doreen Spadorcia","Sorry. The benefit, remind you also workers' compensation state assessment liability that we talked about\u2026","Alan Schnitzer","We had a reduction in estimated liability that we announced in the first quarter and we quantified it, so you will see it in our press release and 10-Q for the first quarter, so that really was the anomaly this year, so if you add that back in and look at the full year, round numbers I would say, it is always going to be up or down a little bit for one thing or another, but that will give you sort of a ballpark.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. Great. Then last one for Jay Fishman. Is there anything that you think could happen in the reinsurance market as far as evolution or innovation that would allow you or how you to consider pursuing more growth in catastrophe exposed areas utilizing reinsurance or is that something at this point that is still not something that you foresee. Thanks again.","Jay Fishman","Sure. It is irrelevant question of course. First, we are engaged, involved and looking at lots of different things. The specific question you asked is, are you prepared to build primarily exposure and rely on a reinsurance profile that may or may not be permanent to produce an effective loss profile and there is the potential of mismatches there are substantial.","Meaning, on the primary side very difficult to non-renew. Reinsurance, obviously, to be non-renewed instantly, when that happens, even if you pursue a primary non-renewable strategy, that 12 months where you had to think where the primary exposure sits and the reinsurance is simply not there anymore, so that is an arbitrage that I think as a potential mismatch to it that's concerning.","Now, if reinsurance pricing were to drift low enough, in my judgment it is not there yet, you might sit there and contemplate doing that, but I would say that the mismatch risk there has real shareholder value attachment to it as well as regulatory.","I mean, imagine trying to non-renew a significant enough book of business, where you would actually do this as a strategy as opposed to an operate tactic. It would be very disruptive, so I think not in that regard, but it doesn't mean that there might not be other opportunities and we are sure pushing it around. It is not obvious to us yet.","Pluses and minuses, these things will have certain complexities to them, but it is not obvious to us yet that there is some magic, a dynamic there that has happened, the changes, the fundamental underlying economics of being the primary business. Now, maybe it keep going in that direction, but - not yet.","Michael Nannizzi","Great. Thank you so much, Jay.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Stirling of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Josh Stirling","Good morning, Jay. Glad you brought up the St. Paul Travelers' deal. I think it is really interesting topic for us to talk about today. Going back 10 years, people were not sure about the deal, but it has obviously been a fantastic success. As we are seeing a new wave of consolidation, I am curious to hear your perspective on the M&A we are seeing in the market today?","When you think about the opportunities you guys are presenting, I am sure you have had a lot of opportunities to consider and debate this, and I am wondering more specifically, you have made a couple of smaller investments in the past couple of years. Should we expect you to do more of these as stock buybacks become more expensive in your multiple runs or alternatively should we expect you potentially to be more of a material consolidator in the small and mid-cap consolidation rate that seems to be starting? Just would love to get a sense how you think about capital priorities here.","Jay Fishman","It is a really good question, so let us break it into a couple of component parts. First, on the international horizon, to the extent and the Columbia situation was a pretty good one, I think, Dominion even though it was a $1 billion trade, to the extent there are opportunities to do things of that nature, where a business is either relatively new or underperforming and we think that collectively locally and what we bring ourselves, we can improve it, we will continue to look for those opportunities.","It is they are increasingly harder to find, driven in some measure by the economics. Much of the economic environment outside the U.S., as well as the general competitive environment that exists outside the U.S. There are lot of areas where you would say kind of the last thing you want to do is, be competing there, and that was just not been in significant list, but nonetheless to the extent that opportunities present themselves in international front, we will we will most certainly look at them.","I would not contemplate, by the way I could be completely wrong here. Meaning, you are asking me for an outlook, I am giving it to you today, that doesn't mean that we could change, but I would not contemplate that those would be large transactions.","I do not know how one would look at Dominion. I do not think of it as a large transaction, meaningful, but I would not contemplate that international front, what would be that.","We really have no interest in the reinsurance business in the broadest sense, so to the extent that there are the things happening in the arena Bermuda or otherwise, we largely do not pay attention to it and I do not really have a view on the value that has created there. I am not knowledgeable I am not close enough to it to have a thoughtful view.","We have always said about acquisitions and this hasn't changed. It is very, very much the same. We are a return-driven organization, the principal view that we would take for looking at anything is what would it do to our return profile over time. Would it potentially improve our return dynamics and that could be either in magnitude or in volatility. To the extent there is diversification, geographic expansion and providing lower volatility returns that could meet the threshold also.","The challenge for us in that regard is that, when you do something small in our business, you take all the risks of whatever it was, whatever undisclosed liability, whatever policy was written 20, 30, 40 years ago, you have got it. In many cases, the controls and procedures and knowledge base that exists in small companies just did not [ph] to warrant the risk they could take to getting into it. They just don't have the database that gives you a sense of comfort, when you are spending your shareholders' money that it is wise.","In the larger transactions, given that we are such a high return organization, relative to the industry, it is hard to find at a price that can be achieved, a transaction that would meet that return threshold. They would [ph] for sure, but that is interesting, but not highly relevant. We are big enough, we do not need to be any bigger, but we are driven about returns, driven by them.","If something significant were ever to be available, we would look and we would look hard. I do think that we are really good. By the way, at the front end at the back-end meaning - that goes on, when we look at something. Then, once we decide to proceed the execution side and a complex and complicated transaction, I think we are pretty good at that and I am speaking out for what is what people know in the marketplace, but also what you don't know. The things that we have looked at, the things that we have walked away from, because our own due diligence suggested no, that is not for us, so it's good.","I think the challenge will be meeting all those standards. That doesn't mean we do not roll up our sleeves and dig in and we will continue to try, so but again that's my answers [ph] I can give you.","Josh Stirling","That is helpful, Jay. Thank You. If I could sneak in a quick one on pricing, so look I get that it used to be very cyclical industry and you have become much more data-driven and the company is more disciplined.","If you are in the trenches in you are an actuary and underwriter, should we be expecting that generally a good - be able to cover their cost over the next couple of years, raising pricing you know 2%, 3%, whenever that entails or is that just kind of unrealistic, but it is still competition and capacity still matters and basically the market price is going to be driven by the more aggressive guys who probably do not do as good a job managing their business and they cut the market price to reduce margins, and sales and shift top-line growth?","Jay Fishman","I am always hesitant to speak for any other company, because I can only from the outside in proceed how you are manage their business, but I can speak to what we do and how we run our business.","Underwriters will do, good ones, will do with precision what you ask them to do, so you better be really good at knowing what you are asking of them. We have taken the view, when I might - from the outside looking in is that we are not unique in this regard others too. If you tell an underwriter grow, they will. We don't tell them that, we tell them to find thoughtful ways to deploy capital. If they cannot, it is okay. It's okay. No one will ever be asking you why they did not meet their volume budget, because first time you asked them that they will meet at the next quarter and all of us understand that you would never speak to loan officer that way at the back.","You would not say to a loan officer here is your volume goal and the torpedo is full speed ahead. If we do not perceive that there is a lot of difference between that risk profile and speaking to field underwriter, so we value their judgment and their insight and the data and analytics that we have in front of them to make thoughtful decisions to own the account, to think about do I want that account in my portfolio for the long-term, and what will it do to the return of my portfolio in a collaborative environment of the type that we have here.","Really I cannot underestimate, I cannot overstate rather, I am sorry. I can't overstate how different that is than it was 20 years ago. It is just quite different. I think most importantly is that the feedback loop between what goes on in the field and what is really - knowledge at the home office to ways going on is stunningly shorter than it was 20 years ago, so the ability to act and react to changes not just cyclical big time changes, but local changes on offices, on market, on company in a local place is just that much better.","I believe, again, I could be dead wrong. I think that the cyclicality of our business is and will be meaningfully reduced. Anybody who has tried prices are up now let's grow, I can't think of one company that has successfully executed that strategy in any meaningful way. If you look at history, it becomes difficult to say, boy that is a smart thing to do. I think the people who manage our businesses understand what it means to manage your risk profile and as a consequence they will do so.","Now, on a given year, where we seek a - we will receive if long-term, if loss trend is 4%, we would be stupid to tell underwriters they got to get 4% on every account. That means we are losing accounts that don't need 4% in their returns and we will get 4% on those accounts that we - so we say to them be return-driven with that account, be smart, be thoughtful and be return-driven and it has worked for us.","I think if there is anything about our results over these particularly last five years, I think that many industry observers have not appreciated how productive that approach can be to profitability improvement. Getting the right rate on the right account is really what it is all about. I think more and more people are beginning to understand that.","Josh Stirling","Thank you, Jay.","Gabriella Nawi","Tina, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jay Cohen","Yes. Two quick questions. Maybe the other one a little bit last, quick. Since we have had a notable drop in interest rates, if you can give us a sense of what the new money yields look like for your portfolio versus the portfolio yield today?","Bill Heyman","Well, Jay Benet has given you an idea of what our expectations would be over the next two or three years due to the drop in interest rates. We did that in the back of the envelope last night that is already, but last night the new money rates were about 50 basis points lower than the rates Jay was using in making his calculation which would equate to about $20 million after taxes of lower earnings, $20 million a year, the delta.","This morning the tenure rate is up a little bit, but that $20 million is $15 million or $16 million, but there is no question that these rates are lower. Last year, as we look at our investment results, which including 2013 much to our surprise, they did so notwithstanding the fact that their rates were lower than our projections at the beginning of the year. We made for this year a new set of projections, which already looks 22 days in, but we are not [ph] in yet, but nonetheless about $20 million a year different.","Jay Fishman","That\u2019s was Bill Heyman speaking.","Jay Cohen","Right. The tenure is actually down a little bit today, but at the end of the call - who knows. Second question, if we could get more color on international price change. We saw the premium change, but obviously I think exposure, but what's happening from a pricing standpoint in your major international markets?","Jay Benet","I do not have this slide in front of me right now, but I think it is in the webcast. You are talking about rate internationals?","Jay Cohen","Yes.","Alan Schnitzer","I would say what is there in RPC is split probably pretty evenly between rate and exposure.","Jay Cohen","Okay. You are still getting overall increased internationally?","Alan Schnitzer","We still have an overall positive renewal rate change in international, yes. The other thing I would tell you about our international relative to U.S. is our outlook for loss trend in outside the U.S. it is lower in the U.S., because we do not have the same level of exposure to the medical inflation.","Jay Cohen","Got it. Is that being helped by Canada, the rate change?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes. I would say the rate in Canada is a higher end of the spectrum.","Jay Cohen","Got it. Thanks Alan.","Gabriella Nawi","Great. Tina next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg of Janney Capital. Please go ahead.","Larry Greenbergs","Good morning. Thank you. I am just wondering if you can characterize how non-cat weather and large losses came in for the full year 2014, relative to what would be viewed as normal?","Alan Schnitzer","It's Alan Schnitzer. I do not know if you are talking about business insurance, but I will started in and turn it over to Jay maybe for a - if we grew cats, did you say cats\u2026","Jay Fishman","Non-cat","Larry Greenbergs","The stuff that would flow into underlying...","Alan Schnitzer","Yes. Certainly above expectation and above the prior year.","Jay Fishman","Yes. I think when you look at the entire company, because this is going to be yes, it is like what you are asking if that large losses non-cat weather, they are going to be episodic, there are going to be dependent upon geography and things of that sort. When you look at the entire company, I do not think that this year 2014 was all that unusual a year as it relates to weather.","I am talking non-cat weather now. When you look at BI, when you look at, I am talking non-cat weather now. You know when you look at PI and BI combined, it was probably pretty normal although BI was a little higher and PI was probably a little lower in terms of what they might consider to be normal.","I think when you make the contrast to last year, which gets you away from an expectation and gets you into the weather and large loss activity of last year, meaning 2013 versus 2014, now there are I think 2014 was a little worse than 2013, but still a good year. Hopefully that is helpful.","Larry Greenbergs","Yes.","Jay Fishman","What we tried to do in the press release was to provide you not with the data, because it is difficult to measure these things but to adopt the phrase of normal variability in loss activity from quarter-to-quarter try to accommodate the sort of thought process and get away from the - Now, is it good is it bad, it is going to vary. Hopefully, when you get to a full year, some of the variances is less pronounced.","Jay Benet","It's a challenge for us to estimate normal non-cat weather. It is easier for us to speak about non-cat weather this year compared to last, this quarter compared to last year's quarter, but it has been exceptionally difficult for us to come to what would be a normal non-cat weather numbers, so we have a hard time speaking to it that way.","Jay Fishman","If I could just add, an example of what makes it difficult, you have times when given the granularity of what we look at, you will be looking an information and say well large losses activities is up somewhere. Then you get into and why is it up, well because slips and walls [ph] are taken, but the slips and walls, because of the weather. Yes. It is a very difficult bucketing process to end up summarizing all of this data and what we try to do is give you the concepts of what taking place.","Larry Greenbergs","Great. Now, that is helpful. Then on direct, I listened to what you had said earlier about continuing to invest in that business. The last couple of years, you have generated statutory underwriting losses of about $100 million from the businesses growing top-line a bit, you are getting a little bit of scale economics probably.","I mean, when we think about that over the next few years, is that sort of the normal run rate of what expectations should be? I mean, is there going to be a drop in investment spending somewhere out there?","Jay Fishman","Well, this is Jay Fishman. I do not have a better number if I were looking out and one we are experiencing now and. To the extent markets change, certainly have not changed, obviously our strategy will, but if we start off with the premise that - when we started this investment, we said it. We said we were less concerned than some industry observers if a typical Travelers customer would go to buying direct, but we were not ready to bet the trumpet [ph] and therefore ignore the trends, so the development has been important.","It is not apparent to us yet that there are enough Travelers-type customers who choose to buy direct or a direct business is scalable on it owned. It is not that we don't know how to get people to respond or how to quote and had issue, we would become really, really good at that that.","It is that the number of people that we would think of as the customer that we seek are not choosing to respond that way, now that may change three or four or five years from now. It is a trend. I don't think it is appropriate to ignore it, so we will continue to develop the expertise and the skill, so that if in fact things change and there is a market opportunity for us, we are in a position to respond and we are not\u2026","The other point I would make and I do not know how to quantify it for you, but I would tell you that the benefit to the agency business, the investment, the technology and the underlying customer reach attributes, the ways customer connects to us, our ability to respond as and as a, I will call it an electronic company, for lack of a better term that has just been invaluable.","I don\u2019t know how any dollars it meant in the agency business, but I do know it is important. As I would remind everyone, I am not so unhappy that, that the Travelers' customer has not turned away from the agency channel as quickly as some people though. That is good for us. We have got a very big agency based business that is very profitable. If that change continues to occur more slowly, that is just fine with us, so this is a kind of a hedge your position investment that is necessary, because it is just not clear that it will continue this way, but I would say, yes. That is what I would certainly included if was..","Larry Greenbergs","Great. Thanks for your comments.","Gabriella Nawi","Great. Thank you. Tina, this will be our last and final question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith","Yes. Thanks. Just two quick ones here. First, one for Alan and Jay, if I look at the business insurance business right now, and we look at the returns that are generating, they are pretty attractive right now. Is there any consideration or thought about having underwriters expand their risk profile right now kind of looking maybe into the E&S market a little bit, I know there are kind of ebbs and flows with the cycles. Also loss trend continues to be pretty favorable, so I think that is an area for growth?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes. Brain it is Alan. I guess the way we would think about that is, we are always challenging ourselves to think about whether there are new marketplace opportunities, but I would distinguish that from changing our risk profile to do it.","If we could find opportunities whether it is in energy or whether it is in E&S or any other market, we would certainly look at it, but that would not involve any change in our return thresholds or our risk appetite.","Brian Meredith","Got you. Okay. Then the second one is for Doreen. Just looking at the homeowners, continued to see the declines in PIF, any thoughts on when that could start to stabilize or maybe start to trend upwards and what impact do you think the decline in PIF in the homeowners business is having on your auto insurance growth here?","Doreen Spadorcia","Brian. Good morning. I will answer that with a couple of different comments. We put some, as Brian referenced in his comments, due to some of the weather that we were seeing coming through the book and just where the levels of deductibles were and roof issues, we took some pretty strong actions in the homeowners' book.","Some of our declines there were deliberate, whether it might be some concentration in some areas, so it was not unexpected to us that we would see some shrinkage. That being said, we feel really great of that we have come through the other side of that where our deductibles are, where the PIF is.","The rest of the market probably was not as aggressive as we were in addressing property, but from where we are today and launching forward, we are very excited about that. We feel like we have got just a great launch point on that, because we look at account underwriting, there is no question that when there is pressure on one product, there might be some impact to the other product around either new business or retention. We have seen with QA 2 as we have become more competitive there, that we think that has allowed us to start growing the home line again.","We are still in a negative position, but I can tell you that for 2015 and beyond that is going to be a very strong focus of ours, whether it is going to be how we do digital marketing, leading with some of our home capabilities, because we think they are industry-leading, whether it is to look at some different kind of practices in the quote process or an overall customer view, so we can utilize the strength in the property line to actually get not just more homeowners business, but more customer business for the Travelers.","We knew that homeowners was going to be, the recovery was going to follow auto, so we are in the spot that we thought we would be and there is a lot of focus on that.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thanks for answers.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.","Gabriella Nawi","Great. Thank you all for joining us today. As always, I will be available for further follow-up. Thank you and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect all lines. Thank you and have a good day."],"21627":["The Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 23, 2013  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Member of Operating Committee","Jay S.

Welcome to the First Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, April 23, 2013. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you, Andre. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2013 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.","Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions.","Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.","Also, in remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.","And now, Jay Fishman.","Jay S. Fishman","Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before turning to our results this morning, I want to take a moment and comment on the events of the last week. No doubt, someone will ask about the cost of the events in Boston or in West Texas. While right now we don't expect either event will be meaningfully costly to us, my real answer is that the human cost is stunning, and we are reminded of the fragile nature of the world in which we live. Our sympathies go out to everyone affected in these horrific events, and we will do all we can to help them in the recoveries. As we are reminded of September 11, we wish only the best for the folks in Texas and embrace fully the sentiment of Boston strong.","Now turning to our results. We are very pleased to report a strong start to 2013, with operating income of $2.31 per diluted share, which is the highest quarterly operating income per share since Travelers' initial public offering in 2002. Both net and operating income increased 11% from last year's first quarter results to $896 million and $887 million, respectively, producing a return on equity of 14.1% and an operating return on equity of 15.8%.","Our margins improved significantly, with a GAAP combined ratio of 88.5%. Importantly, underlying underwriting margins increased across all our business segments, in large measure the result of the pricing and underwriting actions we have taken over the last few years. Our 90.8% underlying GAAP combined ratio was an improvement of almost 4 points from the prior year, as earned rate increases outpaced expected loss trends in each segment.","While we are certainly pleased with these results, we will continue our strategy of taking the steps necessary to continue improving accident year profitability and returns. Our focus is evident in the production statistics for each segment this quarter. Renewal rates were at or above levels achieved in recent quarters and exceeded expected loss-cost trends in each segment.","In addition, retention rates remain at very high levels. We also saw modest new business growth in Business Insurance. And while new business in Personal Insurance remains meaningfully down from historical levels, it was consistent with fourth quarter 2012 levels. Brian will take you through the details by segment.","Next, I'd like to comment briefly about our total return to shareholders as measured by the net stock price change plus cumulative amount of dividends over the same time period assuming dividend reinvestment. We've shown this information in the past and believe it is an important measure of our long-term success.","The universe you see on Slides 4 and 5 contain the 20 largest S&P financial companies by market capitalization, as well as companies in our P&C insurance peer group. As Slide 4 demonstrates, our total return to shareholders for each of these periods is impressive. Slide 5 shows the return on a Treynor risk-adjusted basis. And amongst these companies, we are first on a 1- and 5-year basis, and sixth on a 3-year basis. These results are very gratifying.","It's worth noting that over the last 5 years, the compound annual growth rate in our book value per share has been 9.4%; in earnings per share, it's been 8.6%; and in dividends per share, it's been 9.7%. If we include the dividend increase announced today, it's 11.5%.","Before I turn it over to Jay, I want to take a moment and extend the best wishes of 30,000 Travelers' employees to our friend and colleague, Chuck Clarke. Chuck is retiring after 55 years, indeed a lifetime of service with Travelers. It is not possible to overstate the impact that Chuck has had on so many of us at Travelers, and we will all benefit from his powerful legacy for many years to come. He is the best in our business, and we all wish him the best in this next chapter in his life. I will miss him more than I can express.","With that, let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay S. Benet","Thanks, Jay. As Jay said, we're very pleased with our first quarter results as well as our liquidity and capital positions. Operating cash flows of approximately $530 million. It was strong despite higher-than-normal claim payment related to Storm Sandy. We repaid $500 million of debt that matured in March and maintained our strong cash position, ending the quarter with holding company liquidity of just over $1.5 billion. We continue to generate more capital than what is needed to support our businesses, so we returned $476 million of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $176 million and common share repurchases of $300 million, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy.","And we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.46 per share to $0.50 per share, an increase of almost 9%. We also recorded on a consolidated basis, pretax net favorable prior year reserve development of $231 million for the quarter, which was lower than the $304 million we recorded in the prior year quarter. And each of our segments, once again, saw its reserves develop favorably.","I should point out that this quarter's reserve development included an unusual item, a $42 million pretax charge, precipitated by legislation in New York related to the New York fund for reopened cases for Workers' Compensation.","Business Insurance accounted for a little less than half of this quarter's total reserve development. Favorable development in BI was driven by better-than-expected loss experienced in general liability for accident years 2003 and prior, as well as accident years 2004 through 2010, resulting from a more favorable legal and judicial environment than we had expected; and by property loss development for accident years 2010 through 2012.","I should also note that BI reserve development was reduced by the $42 million pretax charge precipitated by the New York legislation concerning Workers' Comp that I mentioned previously. And excluding the impact of this legislation, our Workers' Comp reserves were essentially unchanged for all accident years.","The rest of this quarter's favorable reserve development primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss development in Bond & Financial Products contract surety business for accident years 2006, '07, '08 and '10, better-than-expected loss development of several international businesses within FPII and better-than-expected cat and non-cat loss development in Personal Insurance Homeowners business for accident year 2011.","On a combined statutory basis for all of our U.S. subs, accident years 2003 and prior as well as accident years 2004 through 2011, all developed favorably in the quarter, while accident year 2012 developed very slightly unfavorably.","And finally, to update you on Storm Sandy, our current estimate of total ultimate losses is now $1.011 billion net of reinsurance and pretax, down $13 million from our fourth quarter 2012 estimate.","Finally, all of our capital ratios remained at or better than our target levels at the end of the quarter. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $4.4 billion pretax or $2.9 billion after-tax, a slight decrease from the beginning of the year, due to the rise in interest rates that took place during the quarter. And book value per share was $68 or $0.07 -- 7% higher than at the end of the prior year quarter and 1% higher than at the beginning of the year.","So with that, let's have Brian talk about the operations.","Brian W. MacLean","Thanks, Jay. I'll go through the segment results in some details, but the overall headline from an underwriting perspective is the margin expansion that we saw in all our business segments.","Beginning with Business Insurance. We continue to be extremely pleased with the fundamentals of the business. The combined ratio for the quarter of 89.4% improved slightly versus the prior year. While the underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year development, improved by more than 4 points.","As always, there's some non-run rate items in the quarter, but 3 points of the improvement was driven by earned rate increases that exceeded loss-cost trends.","Net written premiums increased 5%, with the largest increase in Workers' Compensation, driven by higher rate and exposure in our guaranteed cost and National Account businesses.","Turning to the production statistics, starting on Page 11. Overall retention was in line with recent periods at 80%. Pricing remains strong, with renewal premium change over 10%, and new business volume was up slightly from recent quarters.","Drilling into the pricing results. The renewal premium change was driven by pure rate increases of 8% and exposure of over 2%. The rate gains we achieved this quarter were up slightly from both the previous quarter and the first quarter of 2012. Rate increases ranged from 6% to 10% across all lines and were once again led by Workers' Compensation and Commercial Auto.","As we've explained before, when comparing the quarter's data with prior periods, keep in mind that the data develops over time and can bounce around a bit, and this is especially true of exposure.","On Slide 15, we show our commercial accounts rate change and retention data for the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the first quarter of 2012. This slide presents a summarized view of how we analyze the pricing and retention on our renewal book to ensure we are taking the right actions.","The data is segmented by the individual account's long-term loss ratio, with the bars on the left representing our best-performing business, accounts with long-term loss ratio of less than 60%; and the bars on the right representing our worst performing businesses, that is accounts with long-term loss ratios exceeding 90%. The results show that retention is stronger for the better business and the rate change is dramatically higher on the poor performing accounts.","I would emphasize that this is summarized data, so don't overanalyze the precision on the page. But what this data continues to tell us is that our underwriters are making the right targeted rate decisions, class by class, account by account.","So with the continued improvement in pricing and loss trends holding across Business Insurance at about 4%, we continue to see meaningful margin expansion.","In our Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, the combined ratio for the quarter was 82.3%, an improvement of 5.5 points year-over-year. The underlying combined ratio improved nearly 4 points, driven by underwriting actions across the segment, along with increased rate in our Management Liability business. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of improving underlying loss ratios for the segment.","Net written premiums increased by 7% in the quarter, driven primarily by lower reinsurance cost across the segment. Gross written premium showed a modest increase of about 1% in the first quarter, driven by strong rate gains in our Management Liability book of business, partially offset by a slight decline in surety premium. All in, a great quarter for the segment.","In Personal Insurance, operating income was up significantly versus the first quarter of 2012, due to higher underlying underwriting margins, lower levels of catastrophe losses and higher net favorable prior year reserve development. The combined ratio for the quarter of 89.4% improved more than 8 points versus the first quarter of 2012, while the underlying combined ratio showed more than a 3-point improvement year-over-year.","Looking specifically at Auto, we continue to be very pleased with both pricing and retention, with renewal premium change of nearly 9% and retention at 81%, both in line with recent periods, while new business volume was down year-over-year. What these results demonstrate is that we've been successful in achieving rate increases on the renewal book, but our pricing actions have meaningfully impacted our new business, and we are watching this trend carefully.","Turning to Auto profitability. The underlying combined ratio of 94.4% was an improvement of over 1 point versus the prior year quarter, reflecting the earned impact of the written rate gains we have achieved over the past several quarters. It's important to remember that there's a significant amount of seasonality and losses for this line, and the first quarter loss ratio typically runs a little below the full year average. I would also note that the unfavorable prior year development in this line is due to a slight increase in our estimate of Sandy Auto claims.","Regarding loss-cost trends, we've been talking to you about increasing bodily injury severity for more than a year, and we were encouraged that the bodily injury severity trend we saw this quarter remained consistent with what we have seen in the previous 2 quarters. In addition, earned pricing remains in excess of our current view of loss trend. And assuming loss trend remains at this level, we will see year-over-year Auto margins expand for the remainder of 2013.","Looking at Homeowners. Pricing was also very strong, with renewal premium change coming in at 12%, down slightly from the fourth quarter of 2012 but up more than 2 points year-over-year. Retention remains strong at 84%, while new business volume was meaningfully lower than the prior year quarter due to the execution of our pricing, underwriting and deductible strategies.","The underlying combined ratio for the quarter of 81.1% improved more than 4 points over the prior year quarter, benefiting from a lower level of non-cat weather and fire losses, along with earned rate increases that exceeded loss-cost trend. So a very strong underwriting result. But given the ongoing volatility of weather patterns, we will continue to implement improved underwriting pricing in terms and conditions.","Overall in the segment, there was progress on the underlying fundamentals along with some benefit from the lower weather-related losses but still a work in process, and we'll continue to execute on our strategy in order to further improve our results.","With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Andre, we're ready for the question-and-answer segment. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just -- I have one question, Brian. In -- you talked about Personal lines, you talked about the rate gains you're getting both on the Homeowners and the Auto side. But I think in the Q, the outlook you mentioned that you expected profitability to be roughly in line with what you saw in 2012. Just trying to square those 2 items, and just one follow-up.","Brian W. MacLean","So -- and specifically, I just want to make sure, that's a Homeowners...","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I think you said in the Q, I think it's said the outlook for Personal lines, overall, was that profitability would be -- should be in line with 2012 or you would expect it to be in line with 2012. And just given that you're taking mid- to high-single digit, I think you said double-digit rate gains, I'm just trying to understand how -- why that number shouldn't be better next year than this year.","Jay S. Benet","Yes. This is Jay Benet. What we tried to say in the Q was that what we had last year were various quarters that had favorable weather, favorable fire losses. And as you can easily understand in the Homeowners, it's very difficult to predict what a normal level of these things are. So thinking about what the outlook for the year was in Homeowners, our view was well, they were favorable last year, so whatever normal is this year, sounds like it should be a little higher. So despite having this underlying concept of rate exceeding some view of loss trend, and that's a pretty difficult concept when you get into a business that has so much of its losses tied up in weather and fire-type events, we do feel that there's an improvement in profitability coming about through pricing versus this concept of loss trend, but that improvement will be offset if these other levels of losses go back to whatever a\"normal\" is. So it's a very difficult equation, if you will, to try to come up with an outlook for that business but that was our best shot as it relates to Homeowners. And then on the Auto side, the view was a little marginal improvement based upon pricing, where it is today versus in that business a much better view as to what loss trend looks like. So...","Jay S. Fishman","A better meaning, more accurate, more predictable. Yes.","Jay S. Benet","Yes, yes. So looking at the 2 combined, one getting better, one if things go back to normal in Homeowners, who knows whether they will, getting a little less margin, the 2 of them should kind of offset and the profitability should be roughly at the same level.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. Okay, great. And then just in Business Insurance, we certainly saw exposures kind of pick up in some of the reporting that you provided us with. Just trying to understand, so you've got -- so you've -- you're taking rate, you're expecting to continue to do that, your retention is not falling and you're seeing exposures lift. Is that exposures on the business that you had? Or is that potentially being impacted by new business or new endorsements on old business?","Brian W. MacLean","Michael, this is Brian. So the exposure numbers we show are all on our renewal book, for starters, driven by a whole bunch of things. In Property, for example, there's been a lot of movement to improve insurance to value. So that would -- we could have the exact same building but getting a different insurance to value on it, and that would be driving exposure up. It can be more employees in Workers' Comp. It could be more vehicles, more receipts on a GL rating, so it can be a whole -- all of those different things. As I mentioned in my comments, too, I would also point out that the granular nature of the exposure data, in particular on Commercial Accounts, moves around a bit, as premium audits come in, et cetera. So there is a lift there but maybe not as dramatically as some of that data shows. It moves around.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the premium auto, it's been trending in which direction recently?","Brian W. MacLean","For the last several quarters, they've been pretty flat. They rose dramatically as we came out of the 2008-2009 time period. But for the -- yes, and clearly, it's positive. Premium audits have returned to the traditional couple points of positive on average.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So this is obviously a great quarter. And as we sort of -- as we work through results, we're starting to get -- see some players get more comfortable with margins. And obviously, Travelers has been the leaders thus far in raising pricing and talking about sort of accident years being not a target. I'm curious to get a sense of how far you think we may have to go on pricing. You're guiding to continued pricing in '13 in your outlook in the K -- in the Q and would love to get a sense of how much further accident year sort of margin expansion you think that the industry needs to get back to target.","Jay S. Fishman","Josh, it's Jay Fishman. I can't speak to the industry or any other company. I can tell you what we're doing. We're going to continue, and it's driven by 2 factors: First, the weather remains unpredictable and just more uncertain than it has in many years, and that's been the case for the last several years and that's been driving much of our action. But the other part is that as our investment portfolio continues to mature, the effect of reduced interest rates will continue to push the fixed portion of net investment income down over the next several years. We've provided those projections to you previously with -- or actually they're more than projections, they're almost the actual numbers, such as that bonds as they mature will be reinvested. So we will -- I would refer you back to that schedule to get some sense of that impact. So that net investment income will continue to decline for the next several years at least, unless interest rates change. The weather remains very unpredictable and uncertain, so we're going to keep going.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's helpful, Jay. The other thing that's surprising about this, just as a follow-up, a couple of years back, it was clear that it was easier to maintain margins and maintain sort of pricing in the soft market in the sort of smaller areas and in personal lines. But it sounds like if I'm interpreting what you guys are saying correctly that I think that there is more pricing momentum to continue in sort of the larger mid-market Commercial Accounts, National Accounts businesses as opposed to the smaller businesses in Personal lines. And I'm wondering if you can talk about one, I guess, if that's right but then also just sort of underlying what that -- sort of how those 2 different markets have diverged and what we all ought to understand about how they operate differently.","Jay S. Fishman","No worries. We tend to think of those markets really in 3 segments, and even that's an understatement of what's -- of what the real environment is, but we tend to think of small middle market individually underwritten accounts and then the National Accounts business. And certainly, over a long period of time, the competitive dynamics in the National Accounts arena, in particularly has been more dramatic than the level of competition in the smallest accounts. In fact, if I recall correctly, I don't think that renewal price change in our Select business actually ever went negative. We should check that but that's my recollection. I don't believe it ever did, and obviously, it did in middle markets. And for those who engage in the real National Accounts business, and I would observe that our participation in that segment is actually relatively modest, that's been the most competitive. So that's a historical framework, I think, around which to think of pricing. For what's happened over the last several years, we have been successful at passing along price increases, both in our small commercial business, as well as our middle market individually underwritten businesses. And I'm not sure that the differences in the ability to pass or at least as measured by rate gains or renewal price change in the small business, I don't think that there's been a significant difference in the ability to be successful in those 2 segments. The dynamics are quite different on the individually underwritten business, it's account by account. It is in many cases, loss driven. It's the experience of the individual account. In Select, you're dealing with class underwriting. And so you're dealing with -- think of it as one with personal lines, a price established for a class of business. So the nature of the underwriting decisions are different but the results are interesting in that we've been successful at getting rate gains in that small end, as well as the individually underwritten business that are largely in the aggregate the same. Do you want to talk about National Accounts at all? Or -- I'm looking at Brian.","Brian W. MacLean","I mean, National Accounts is a little bit more of a service model. A lot of what we do there, the majority of what we do on the casualty side is all loss responsive. And the market conditions have been such that our service capabilities have been viewed very favorably, and so the pricings improved there pretty dramatically. But -- and we've done really well there. So we feel good about -- we're not a large casualty risk taker in that space.","Jay S. Fishman","And that is an important distinction. We -- our -- even our National Accounts business, we'll write national property on a guaranteed cost basis, we'll do that. Our casualty business, both in terms of liability as well as, in particular Workers' Compensation, is largely in one fashion or another, a fee-for-service business where we are managing a claim on behalf of the clients. So we are not -- as one would think of a guaranteed cost risk taker in the larger end...","Brian W. MacLean","The risk we would take there would be excess [ph].","Jay S. Fishman","Yes, yes, exactly right. I hope that's helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just had a question about the Personal lines business and the change in PIF this quarter. While the retention seems to be holding constant on both the Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners, there's been a pretty significant decline in PIF year-over-year. Wondered if I could just get some more insight on it, just a rate change or a competitive dynamic shift?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, so this is Brian. I'll start. We're clearly watching that closely. So obviously, in our statistics, you can see the renewal book is performing well. We feel great about that. The actions that we are taking and we believe it's very directly tied to the actions we're taking from a pricing, deductible, underwriting perspective, specifically on the last point there on Homeowners, is impacting our new business volumes and our competitive position in the marketplace. And like I said, we're watching it closely and we're going to continue to manage it. But we're committed to improving the profitability there. Jay?","Jay S. Fishman","No, I think you've expressed it right. In the Homeowners business, our sense is and this is a more anecdotal than we can -- than factual. Our sense is, is that the increase in minimum deductibles, in particular, in not an insignificant number of states to really try and bring the policy back to its historical intent is having an impact on new business competitively. It had been our hope, I think, more than anything else that the weather changes that are -- that we're confronting, those are systemic. They're not unique to us. They are systemic in that any thoughtful underwriting-driven company would, in the long run, evaluate how you make a reasonable return in that business. So we've taken steps that we think makes sense for us. We're not going to allow our business to continue from a policy in force standpoint to decline in double digits for long without beginning to take other steps that we might have to take. Now one of those steps is not to reengage in the business and make substandard returns. So we'll have to wrestle with the strategy and how we implement that in the marketplace if what we're doing now strategically and tactically doesn't turn out to be competitively viable, and that's why Brian's comment that we will continue to watch this carefully.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then I guess, just sort of a follow-up to that. Any thoughts on how the direct-to-consumer channel is sort of coming along? Or any growth plans to sort of push that line, either advertising or otherwise, accelerate the development of the business?","Jay S. Fishman","Not yet. We continue to -- the test that we're actually continuing to do internally, we refer to as Little America. Our Little America test is -- don't know whether it's 2 or 3 states, but we're actually doing pricing testing in those 2 states, taking states where our agency business was not nearly as prominent as other states, so we can determine the price elasticity of the product and what actions we take and what drives volumes. We're -- we also believe in learning about this that the notion of what I'll call traditional advertising, media-based advertising, that may have run its course. Meaning, we're just not convinced that taking a substantial amount of resources and applying it in traditional media channels actually is going to result in a growth strategy for a business. So we have been deeply exploring digital and the way to drive digital business around it, which we think, at least at this point, has more viability to it and a greater impact. So that's at least a learning in the process that it's possible that American eyeballs are just exhausted from auto insurance ads, and to become another name in that quest may not make a great deal of sense. And lastly, we watch with interest who responds, and we're always wrestling -- not wrestling, that's actually an incorrect word. We are evaluating, is perhaps better, the dynamic of who responds in that channel, the nature of the customer and always wanting to make sure that when we are ready to launch this more substantively, that we really understand the customer that's responding, and we like that customer. And so those are still learning points for us. And until we really feel comfortable that we know what we're doing and we have a likely successful outcome, we're going to keep testing and making sure we wire the thing up properly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","I guess 2 quick follow-up questions. First of all, if I look at Slide 14 for other Business Insurance, it seems that, that exposure rebounded meaningfully over the past few quarters. Can you just sort of delve a bit deeper into the cause for that?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, so this is Brian. A decent amount of that business is property. So it's got our national property business there, it's got our marine businesses there. As I said, insurance to values improved pretty significantly there, so we've had some movement. And some of the other activity in oil and gas has moved there, so it's a couple of specific things. I wouldn't read robust economic growth into it.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. I guess, the only other question is going back to the charge regarding to the New York fund for reopened cases. Can you sort of just expand on that? And is that the fund, which will close at 1\/1\/2014? I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is, is there a possibility as more new claims come in, could there be further adjustments down the line?","Jay S. Fishman","Sure, you're welcome. It's Jay Fishman. And yes, this is the fund that will close 1\/1\/14 as a result of legislation undertaken in New York. And your question actually is quite relevant. The $42 million pretax that we've provided is an actuarial estimate of the amount of reopened claims that we otherwise would have been -- that would have been seatable to the fund. And as a consequence, we did not build into original loss estimates, loss picks, if you like, in our Workers' Compensation business. And now that's the best estimate we have, given all the data that we have of the amount that will no longer go back to the fund, so we have to provide for the reserve levels. And if in fact the reserve -- the claim activity is different from that actuarial estimate, yes, we will have a variance to that $42 million. Perspectively, it can go up or down, obviously. And -- but the answer to your question is yes, that's correct.","Brian W. MacLean","There isn't anything structural that will require us to take further action. If our estimate is right, we think we've appropriately assessed the liability.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was hoping we could flesh out the audit premiums impact during the quarter. I believe there was a component of healthy growth in at least 1 line. And I was curious if it benefits the combined ratio in a way that we should be cognizant of as well.","Brian W. MacLean","This is Brian. I'm thinking through the question for a second, but I don't think it has any impact on the combined. As we say on the pages of -- well, I'm looking at the Page numbers, 11, 12, 13, those are illustrative production statistics that we use in managing the business. And particularly in Commercial Accounts, how the true-ups of audit premiums flow through that data develops over time. But from a loss projection -- from a loss ratio perspective, I don't think it has any impact.","Jay S. Benet","I mean, without getting into the details of accounting, we have this thing called earned but unbilled amounts on the balance sheet that's trying to take into account everything we know about the particular policyholders that we have. So there's nothing really about the audit premiums per se that are going to drive a major change to the combined ratio at any given quarter. It's just all part of the entirety of the estimation process. And then as far as the overall level of audit premiums, this year in the first quarter versus last year, there really wasn't a significant change in the dollar amount. So as it relates to premium differentials from one quarter to the next, it's not driving that either.","Jay S. Fishman","We actually make an estimate and accrue on a regular basis the amount of estimated order premiums that we project. And then obviously, as each policy ends and each policy audit occurs, we will make an adjustment to that accrual, either up or down, depending on it. In the financial crisis, what happened, the reason that it became a more substantive issue was that we had never actually seen audit premiums go negative. We were not accruing on the premise that they would be negative so we had significant adjustments then relative to that. But now it's more consistent with historical patterns and is -- so in answer, no. I need to correct one thing I said earlier. I'm reminded by Bill Cunningham who is here. I said that I couldn't -- I didn't recall that select RPC had ever been negative. And in fact, it was. In the RPC in the fourth quarter of '08, it was the -- the others were third quarter of '08, first quarter of '09, it was flat. But fourth quarter of '08, it was modestly negative. So apologies for sort of my memory not being perfect on that.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. And lastly, so I see -- the Travelers stock valuation has increased fairly meaningfully. I noticed that share repurchases plus the dividend lag net income by a fair amount this quarter. Is that due to the debt repayment? Or should we -- or is there a change in philosophy, perspectively?","Jay S. Benet","No, there's no change in philosophy. As we've said before, there's a lot of timing differentials that take place, as to when you earn the money, what moneys are up at the holding company versus in the operating company, but there's absolutely no change in philosophy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You guys are actually sitting at your targeted ROEs at least for 1 quarter. So I'm wondering does that -- how does that shift your thinking in terms of managing the business? You're -- even in a low interest rate world, you're getting where you want to be. So how did things change?","Jay S. Fishman","Yes. Greg, we reflect again sort of the same comment I made earlier. The fact is, is that on an accident-year basis, excluding the favorable reserve development, we are not at that level, are going to compounded by the fact that investment income in the fixed portfolio will continue to decline. That's a certainty, unless rates change. And then the third piece is, is that weather remains very unpredictable and the fact that we had favorable non-cat weather in one quarter is certainly not enough for us to conclude that anything is different. So our analysis is largely the same, and so we're going to continue to keep pushing.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So in a way, you're basically normalizing all that stuff when you talk about that mid-teens over time?","Jay S. Fishman","We -- I'm glad you said it. The slide is clear, it says mid-teens ROE over time. And I said several quarters ago that, that was not achievable in this environment. And on an accident year basis, I still don't believe that it really is. And as a consequence, we were going to leave it in place as an aspirational goal, I think are the exact words that we use. And that's where we sit today. And as a consequence, we'll continue to push.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then perhaps the only negative thing in a very strong quarter was just -- or just some clarification around the Workers' Comp reserve side. I understand the onetime charge, but there were no releases anywhere across the book in Workers' Comp. I'm wondering is that the first time that you haven't released from Workers' Comp reserves? And should we be concerned that the last couple years have developed unfavorably there?","Jay S. Benet","This is Jay Benet. What I did say was that there was no change, really, in Workers' Comp. I mean, this is the first quarter of the year, and Workers' Comp has a long tail line, as you know. So we're not -- while we look at everything on a quarterly basis, we don't necessarily have adjustment to all of our reserves on a quarterly basis. So I wouldn't read into that other than we put up reserves in the fourth quarter and we still feel very good about where those reserves are, and we'll see how they develop going forward.","Jay S. Fishman","I'd make an observation even though it's not the question that you're necessarily asking. We're sure that somebody was going to ask us about frequency in Workers' Compensation and the loss trend and kind of where things are in that regard, just reflecting back on our comment a couple of -- I think it was actually 2 years ago, 1.5 years, 2 years ago, which is that the frequency dynamic has indeed returned back to its long-term trend line, which is really good. It was the blip that we saw. I think it was in '10. We attributed it to late filed claims, as a result of the financial crisis. But that frequency line has now returned back to its long-term trend line. There's absolutely no guarantee that it will stay there. It may change next quarter, but we were just prepared for that question. We thought someone would ask. So we feel actually quite good about the Workers' Compensation business. We obviously do have a view on what the accident year returns are in the Workers' Comp line across all the businesses, and we are very much on track there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","Brian, I know you said not to microscope Slide 15 of the deck on the pricing changes by band. But I'm just curious, for the middle band, retention is down a decent bit versus a year ago, where the -- with the outside bands, it's improved a little bit. I'm not sure it matters, but I'm just curious, do you have any theory what's going on there?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, I think so. So part of it -- the honest answer to that is probably the middle bar there, in blue, was a little too high a year ago. And as we looked at marketplace opportunity and the profitability on that business, that's 60% to 90% loss ratio business. There's a wide band within that. So as I -- as we try to emphasize, this is a real simplification of how we look at it. And in every one of our businesses, it's at least quintiles. In many, it's deciles. And we're looking at all the stuff in between. So I wouldn't read too much into that dip. A piece of it was I think as we looked at the data a year ago, we began to execute more granularly there and push on the right account. So we actually feel good about the progress there.","Jay S. Fishman","Bill Cunningham actually a year ago said that there was real opportunity or so he thought, particularly in that -- in the right side of this graph the over-90 segment. And if you take a look at what's happened since, it's just -- I mean, the results are just -- you couldn't have scripted them much better. Retention remains at relatively, let's call them, low levels but rate is even higher. So again, just an analytical validation of the strategic and operational approach that he described a year ago.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","Right, very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the direct business. I mean, your statutory underwriting loss there actually declined pretty significantly this quarter. Clearly, part of it was driven by less expense spend. And I'm just wondering relative to your comments earlier, might we be looking for kind of a new base line underwriting result there, thinking about it holistically?","Jay S. Fishman","The result very specifically is a function of reduced national media spending, advertising. As we pursue this Little America strategy, and Greg shared with me it is 2 states, that our media and digital spending has been very targeted because we're trying to generate activity and results in those states so we can learn about price elasticity. And as a consequence, the aggregate amount of spending is down. I wouldn't overreact on a permanent strategic analysis as to what we've been doing these last few quarters. This is a very targeted moment for us to determine pricing sensitivity. And as a result, less advertising spending is needed to generate the results.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","So there's no top-down decision at this point that we want to cut our losses, not eliminate them, but we want to bring down our underwriting loss from this initiative?","Jay S. Fishman","No, no, no. Quite the contrary. We remain -- the best way to answer is we remain committed to the strategy. And as I've said before, we want to make sure that we know that we have a financial success. It is far easier -- I'm not saying easy, but it's easier to have a marketing success and a financial disappointment, and we are guarding carefully against that. And as a result, we want to make sure that not only do we have a pricing profile that is competitive for our brand, but that the pricing strategy there can produce a reasonable return. So that -- it just takes time for sales to occur, losses to emerge and to evaluate the performance of the business. And I mean, we are in no rush. There's -- we're just not. There'll always be another 25-year-old generation that's coming of age that needs insurance, and I -- it's -- granted there's certainly activity today. But we feel strongly, having years and years ago now had a marketing success and a financial disappointment that we're just not going to go down that path. And we just -- just urgency is not -- to go quickly is not the measure here, it's to go successfully.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Question on reserves and the commentary that the legal environment is better than expected in the '10 to '12 accident years. I just was wondering that's still -- we're seeing that across a bunch of companies but it's still surprising to me that the legal environment was so good in that time, given the economy. So I'd appreciate any color on kind of your thoughts on why that's been the case. Why you've had less exposure legal-wise on casualty lines in that period of time?","Doreen Spadorcia","This is Doreen Spadorcia. I'll try and answer your question. I'll tell you, we had exactly the same assumption. When the economy started to turn, we were worried about not only that but political environment. So we watched down to the county, what's happening around jury award settlements, et cetera, et cetera. And the best I can give you is we think that the financial crisis probably encouraged people to want their dollars faster. And so there were opportunities for settling some cases that maybe in the past they would have waited to see what the amount would have been. We also took very targeted approaches in certain jurisdictions that we thought we had the ability to set some good precedence. But we've just found that the willingness for people settling has been they want to do that sooner rather than later. Whether that will continue, I don't know. We've also seen cases that have gone to verdict. We saw, again, that there might be some views that this is a bad economy, people need the money, where people on the jury have said, \"This is a lot of money given this economy.\" So even the things that have gone to verdict on some of the kind of GL and other things, they've been more reasonable than we anticipated going into this kind of economic environment. But again, that's just our view.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","But it's not for a lack of effort by the -- on the part of the trial bar though, right? I mean, they're very well kind of financed right now and very aggressive. So it's more people wanting their liquidity. Is that -- I guess, that's the takeaway?","Doreen Spadorcia","I can tell you there's a lot of advertising still for the plaintiffs bar, looking for different kinds of cases. There's unique financing tools that people are using around big kinds of lawsuits. So you're right in that regard. I just can tell you what we're seeing. So I don't know if that's across the board.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","That's very helpful. Just one more on reserves. And that is on -- it was '10 to '12 that developed most favorably from the commentary but not kind of '08 and '09 and prior. So time marches on and those years are getting seasoned. Is it -- are we getting to the point now where kind of the '08 in prior accident years kind of stopped giving as much from a redundancy perspective?","Jay S. Benet","This is Jay Benet. I just -- we -- I'll answer the question by saying, every time we provide information on reserves, it's our best estimate and we don't have a crystal ball as to how these things are going to develop. I think that if you think of the arithmetic associated with reserving, as years mature, more and more claims are paid, more and more claims are settled. So it's logical to believe that as the accident years mature, there's going to be less development, but you just have to wait and see how these things actually take place. I mean, we certainly carry IBNR for all the years you mentioned. And sometimes, you have large cases that you think are going to cost you x, and they cost you less or more, whatever. So we just have to see. But I think essentially, the less IBNR you have, the less uncertainty you have, all things being equal, the less development you'll have.","Jay S. Fishman","Some of -- this is Jay Fishman. Some observers in the -- of the industry spend a lot of time commenting about reserve development from hard years, hard cycles or soft years or soft cycles, and people who embrace that thinking can come to view that particular years will be more productive than others. We just -- we don't agree with -- at least for us, I'll speak about Travelers. We just don't believe that, we don't do it. We make our best estimates all the time. They are estimates for loss -- for loss estimates are not driven by the revenue strength of that business. They're just not. And so we don't look at any years necessarily as being more potentially productive than others. And as an old year rolls off a new year comes on, and it just keeps going. So it's -- we just don't spend a lot of time obsessing about individual accident years and what they're producing.","Alan D. Schnitzer","Randy, it's Alan Schnitzer. I would also add to Doreen's response that over that period of time that you mentioned, we also had other developments like the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act that was really pro-defendant and made some cases harder to bring. Other developments like the Class Action Fairness Act, there's been some important cases in the Supreme Court that I think have been some setbacks in some cases for the trial bar. So I think all those things contribute. We, for example, just had an important win at the Supreme Court on an interpretation of the Class Action Fairness Act, in Standard Fire versus Knowles. And so the cases go both ways, of course. But I think if you look back over the last 5 or 6 years, you'd -- probably on balance and maybe just at the margin, but on balance, a slightly improving environment from the defense side.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","My question had been answered.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino with KBW.","Vincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Back to one of your earlier comments about Auto loss-cost trends maybe stabilizing a bit. I'm just curious if you think that this is going to drive -- just that the new found rate competition in the Personal Auto industry. I mean, to your earlier comments, maybe not with Travelers. But is that something you might be able to expect the industry to ramp up on?","Jay S. Fishman","Well, it's Jay Fishman, then I'm going to turn it over to Brian. But my comment about loss stabilization was -- at least mine was specific to Workers' Compensation and it was a frequency comment, where we had seen a tick up in frequency, and it generated a lot of questions over the last several quarters. So I was just commenting that, that, frequency trend was now back in line.","Brian W. MacLean","And maybe you're referring, Vince, back to my comment where I was talking about Auto severity. And so just to be crystal clear, we had been seeing for -- and this goes back a little over a year ago now, we started talking about a ramp-up in Auto severity. The good news is that, that has leveled off third quarter, fourth quarter this quarter at about the same level but it is still higher than historical norms, so it's not the -- the rate of increase isn't increasing anymore, but we still got severity trend.","Jay S. Fishman","That's actually an important point. When we say leveled off, we don't mean that severity has gone to 0.","Brian W. MacLean","Sure.","Jay S. Fishman","What we mean is that the rate of increase is more consistent with our own expectations, and to some extent, historical trends, but it is still increasing.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. So we would -- we obviously don't know what our competitors are planning to do. We do know that the line, the Personal Auto line of business, has gone from a 94 to 102 combined in the last 6 years in an -- for the industry, in an environment with declining infrastructures. So from a return perspective, it's not the healthiest line of business for the industry. And we do look at the publicly available rate filings of our competitors, and that may indicate some movement upward in pricing, but we'll see what actually happens in the marketplace.","Vincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then winter storm Nemo was -- I mean, at least from a Northeastern standpoint, it was a fairly large storm event but we haven't heard anything about Nemo from really anybody yet this quarter. So is it safe to assume that from an industry standpoint, or for Travelers standpoint that, that was basically a nonevent?","Doreen Spadorcia","[indiscernible] Is the cat 96 [ph]?","Brian W. MacLean","I think yes.","Jay S. Fishman","96 [ph], yes. Cats, 96 [ph], I believe.","Doreen Spadorcia","Yes, let me just -- I'm going to look that up really quickly.","Gabriella Nawi","You know what, in the meantime, why don't we go to the next caller, and then we'll come back on that.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Brian, Jay, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about your distribution. And kind of what their mood is right now. We're going to the third year of price increases, are they just getting tired of it? Are they accepting of it? What's kind of the new reaction?","Jay S. Fishman","Well, I think the numbers largely tell the story of where [ph] it will go. The senior team here spends a lot of time with agents and with brokers. If you had to do a short summary, you'd say on the commercial line side, the agents feel terrific. They're just -- they're feeling really good and really supported and solid. They believe that they can talk to their customers, explain the rationale. The best remind their customers how long pricing went down and actually do a pretty good job comparing, where even in a lifted environment how that compares to historical premiums. And so they're feeling pretty good. I don't know if you agree with that, Brian, but that...","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, I do. And we've spent -- in recent weeks, we've been out with agents a lot and talked to a lot of them. I think, again, not to overemphasize the data on Slide 15, but how we execute in the marketplace and really doing it on a granular basis works with them. The more we're having specific conversations about accounts or classes of business, the more focused that is, the better it will be received. The more it's viewed as just a broad-brush approach to the marketplace, the more challenging it will be.","Jay S. Fishman","And on the personal line side, what we're hearing from them is what you see in the numbers, which is that our minimum -- our change in minimum deductibles, our change in underwriting or to some extent, our changes in rate are making us -- causing us to be less competitive on new business. They share with us that the renewal book is fine. And I would say -- I don't know that, that really reflects the mood, but this is a conversation that we have with producers and agents all the time that they're certainly confirming to us that for the moment, the strategies that we're taking in home and in Auto, on the new business side, I would say only, on the new business side only, at least for the moment, is causing us to be less competitive than historically we've been. And we certainly listen to that. We see it in the numbers, and no great surprise to us at the moment.","Brian W. MacLean","Just -- and so just to circle back on the previous question, just a couple quick comments on the big winter storm that we had a couple months ago. We've clearly gotten some claim volume out of that. It hasn't been outsized. It was obviously contemplated in what we booked in the quarter. A couple of comments: From an Auto perspective, at least up here in Connecticut, Massachusetts and the Northeast, they really shut down the roads a lot, so there wasn't a lot of activity. And the type of claims that we get, the really damaging winter storm claims we get tend to be when there is either really extended events, when the snow sits for months on top of roofs and you get damage there or you get collapses. And fortunately, in this event, although we got lots and lots of snow in a short period of time, it warmed up. It got cleared. And so it just wasn't a tremendous event for at least us, and it doesn't appear to have been in the industry either. So...","Gabriella Nawi","All right. We will -- it looks that this concludes our call for -- I don't think we have any more questions in the queue. So if anybody has further questions, as always, Andrew Hersom and I are available in Investor Relations. Thank you, and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference for today.

We ask that you hold all questions for the completion of formal remarks at which time you\u2019ll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 24, 2018.","At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our first quarter 2018 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplements and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.","Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions.","Before I turn it over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.","Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investor section on our website.","And now Alan Schnitzer.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported first quarter core income of $678 million generating core return on equity of 11.9%. Core income was up 10% over the prior year quarter driven by higher pretax underwriting income and a lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. Catastrophe losses of $280 million after tax","were slightly higher than the also unusually high level of catastrophe losses in the prior year quarter.","Results this quarter were impacted by among other events four March nor\u2019easters one of those storms cat 15 generated high claim counts for us in Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C. with some areas experiencing hurricane force winds of up to 90 miles an hour. Both historically and going forward on a model basis, we like the risk adjusted returns in the Mid-Atlantic and accordingly by design we have meaningful market shares in those states. Results in the quarter were also impacted by mudslides in California and a severe winter storm in the UK, so all in an unusual weather quarter.","Despite the high level of catastrophe losses, underwriting income increased and record Q1 net earned premiums were contributing factor. We achieve the topline growth while continuing to deliver a strong underlying combined ratio of 92.4%. We also continue to invest in the strategic initiatives we\u2019ve discussed with you what carefully managing our expense ratio. Our expense ratio has improved by about 1 point in the 2016 level and also down slightly from the prior year quarter. We accomplished that to discipline growth in our topline, disciplined expense management and the successful execution of our productivity and efficiency initiatives. Also noteworthy in the quarter, pretax income from our fixed income investment portfolio increased the first time since 2008. Jay will have more to say about that shortly.","Turning to the topline of production, we are very pleased with the continued successful execution of our marketplace strategies. Net written premiums grew by 5% to a first quarter record of $6.8 billion another strong quarter with growth in all segments. To a large degree this growth once again reflects high levels of retention and positive renewal premium change. That speaks the high-quality of the premium growth.","Greg, tom and Michael will provide more detail on production at the segment level, but I\u2019ll take a minute to comment on the commercial pricing environment. Renewal rate change in domestic business insurance reached 1.6 points with renewal premium change of 4.5 points. In both cases, the highest levels in three years. I\u2019ll also note that once again we achieved renewal rate gains in the quarter more broadly across our middle market accounts compared to recent period. We\u2019re pleased with these results particularly in light of the pricing pressure in the workers comp line. There\u2019s nothing about the workers comp pricing environment so far that surprises us given the industry\u2019s favorable last experience. Excluding workers comp, pure renewal rate change for domestic business insurance was up 3.3 points for the quarter compared to nine-tenths of a point a year ago and 2.4 points in the fourth quarter.","Importantly, we achieved pricing improvement and record retention. As you\u2019ve heard us say in terms of BI looking ahead, there\u2019s a gap between where return to trending and what we\u2019d like them to be trending. So we\u2019ll continue to see great gains thoughtfully and deliberately. I\u2019ll take just a minute to provide an update on strategic initiatives. As we explained at our Investor Day last fall, we\u2019re investing and making sure that our competitive advantages continue to set us apart in the changing world.","We\u2019re focused on extending our lead in risk expertise improving the experience for a customers, agents and brokers and enhancing productivity and efficiency. One of the specific initiatives we discussed was a pilot program to compliment our local underwriting expertise with centralized underwriting of less complex accounts in lower touch business centers. Today, we have all four plan business centers online and step to support our commercial accounts business with all eligible renewal flowing through them.","We expect it all eligible, new business will also be handled through the business centers over the next couple of quarters. Although its still early days we\u2019re pleased with the productivity gains we\u2019re seeing which free up our local underwriters to spend more time with our agent and broker partners pursuing larger more complex account opportunities. Quote activity is up with the increases coming across all accounts sizes. Again its early, but this is the type of outcome the business centers were designed to create. We\u2019re also making progress on key initiatives in both our BOND & SPECIALTY business and in Personal Lines. In Personal Lines for example, we\u2019re pleased with the progress so far in the rollout of our new Quantum Home 2.0 product. You\u2019ll hear more about that from Michael.","Lastly, before I turn it over to Jay, I\u2019m pleased to report that is reflection of confidence in our business, our Board of Directors has declared a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.77 per share. This marks the 14th consecutive year of dividend increases dating back to the St. Paul Travelers merger bringing the compound annual growth rate in the dividend to about 10% over that period.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jay.","Jay Benet","Thanks, Alan. As Alan said, we\u2019re pleased with core income was up 10% this quarter, $678 million versus $614 million in the prior year quarter, which resulted in core ROE of 11.9%. Catastrophe losses were $354 million pretax, which was unusually high for the first quarter although comparable to last year\u2019s unusually high first quarter. Two significant storms in March accounted for almost 70% of the cat losses, cat number 15 an unusual winter windstorm in the Northeast U.S. and cat number 17 a tornado hail storm that did considerable damage in the Southeast United States.","On a more positive note net favorable prior year reserve development, which I\u2019ll discuss in more detail shortly, was $150 million pretax or $69 million higher than in the prior year quarter with each of our segments contributing. Our underlying combined ratio remained strong at 92.4%, up only slightly from 91.7% in the prior your quarter due to normal quarterly variability and both loss activity mostly from non-cat weather and expenses.","Pretax net investment income of $603 million was slightly below the prior year quarter, but there is an important story underneath. In the past, you\u2019ve heard me say over and over again that fixed income NII declined due to historically low interest rates. This quarter pretax fixed income NII of $500 million increased by $12 million compared to the prior year quarter first time we\u2019ve seen an increase in many years. This was driven by the more favorable interest rate environment particularly for short-term rates as well as an increase in our average invested assets due to growing net written premiums in recent periods.","If you add in the benefit of the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, fixed income NII on after tax basis increased quarter-over-quarter by $36 million. Looking forward to the rest of 2018, we\u2019d expect after tax fixed income NII to increase by approximately $40 million to $45 million each quarter as compared to the corresponding quarters of 2017. Te non-fixed income portfolio continued to perform well delivering $113 million of pretax NII.","Within core income, income tax expense was lower than the prior year quarter by $30 million driven by $74 million benefit in the current quarter that resulted from the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate for all the tax exempt income. Partially offset by the inclusion in the prior year quarter of the $39 million benefit that resulted from successfully closing out our federal income tax expense for 2013 and 2014.","As I mentioned consolidated net favorable prior year reserve development was $150 million pretax this quarter compared to $81 million in the prior year quarter. Business Insurance\u2019s net favorable reserve development was $66 million pretax compared to $61 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in domestic workers comp and commercial property, partially offset by higher than expected loss experience in domestic commercial auto.","Bond & Specialty\u2019s PYD was $35 million pretax compared to $14 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by domestic management liability, while PI had net favorable reserve development of $49 million pretax compared to $6 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by domestic homeowners and auto. On a combined statutory Schedule P basis for all of our U.S. subsidiaries, all accident years across all product lines, in the aggregate, and our product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development this quarter except commercial auto, which developed unfavorably by approximately $50 million pretax.","Operating cash flows of $554 million remained strong, although lower than first quarter 2017, primarily due to the relatively high level of cat claim payments. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of almost $1.8 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than target levels. The recent run up in interest rates is benefiting fixed income NII cause net unrealized investment gains to decrease considerably from $1.1 billion after tax of year end 2017 to $133 million after tax at the end of the first quarter. And this decrease in net unrealized investment gains was the driver behind 3% decrease in book value per share from year-end 2017 from $87.46 to $85.03.","I remind you the changes in net unrealized investment gains or losses do not impact the matter in which we manage our investment portfolio or our business. We generally help fixed income investments to maturity, the quality remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little or no regular \u2013 little or no impact on regulatory capital. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains or losses was $84.54 or 1% higher than the beginning of the year and 4% higher than at the end of last year\u2019s first quarter.","We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses. Despite the high level of cat losses, allowing us to return almost $600 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy. We paid dividends of $197 million and repurchase $401 million of our common shares this quarter, including $350 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program and $51 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Alan said, the board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.72 to $0.77 per share.","With that let me now turn the microphone over to Greg.","Greg Toczydlowski","Thanks Jay. Business insurance had a strong quarter with segment income of $452 million, up $10 million from the prior year quarter benefiting from a lower tax rate, as well as higher earned premium volume. The combined ratio of 97.5% included just under 4 points of cats an unusually high level for the first quarter as it was last year. The underlying combined ratio of 95.5% was 1.1 points higher than the prior year quarter driven by loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing, as well as normal quarterly fluctuations in both loss activity and expenses. The impact from loss cost trends exceeding earned pricing that I just referenced has moderated from recent quarters and was in line with our expectations.","Net written premiums for the quarter were $4 billion, up 4% over the prior year quarter with domestic net written premiums up 3% driven by strong production results. International net written premiums were up 3%, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates.","Turning to domestic production, retention improved to a record 86% from an already high level a new business was strong at $525 million. As Alan mentioned, renewal rate change was 1.6 points and renewal premium change was 4.5 points. We\u2019re pleased with these results particularly considering the pricing pressure in workers\u2019 comp associated with strong industry profitability.","Outside of comp, we were encouraged that we achieved renewal rate gains broadly across the product portfolio as rate in auto, property, umbrella, CMP, ENGL increased for the third consecutive quarter on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. Auto continues to be the line with the highest level of rate, while property has improved meaningfully from a year ago, particularly in loss impacted areas. Our results for the quarter reflect our continued deliberate and successful execution in the marketplace.","Turning to the businesses, in Select, as with all our businesses we\u2019re making strategic investments in technology and workflow initiatives to drive growth and we\u2019re encouraged with the progress we\u2019re making. Retention remains strong at 83% and new business was up 8% from the prior year quarter. Renewal rate change remains positive. Given the returns in this business, we\u2019re pleased with these production results.","Turning to Middle Market, retention remained historically high at 88%. Renewal premium change was 3.9 points with renewal rate change of 1.5% up from 1.3% in the fourth quarter and up 1 point from a year ago. New business premiums of $318 million were strong and consistent with the prior year quarter. So all in for the segment, it was a good start to 2018 and we\u2019re pleased with our market execution and given the early adoption from our distribution partners, we\u2019re encouraged about the impact that our technology and workflow initiatives we\u2019ll have in our results.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom to talk about Bond & Specialty Insurance.","Tom Kunkel","Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty\u2019s operating results were very strong, with segment income of $173 million up $28 million from the prior year quarter, due to a higher level of favorable PYD and higher earned premium volume. The underlying combined ratio was also very strong at 80.7% more than 1 point lower than the prior year quarter, reflecting improvement in both the underlying loss and expense ratio.","As to the top line net written premiums for the quarter were up 6%, driven by solid growth in both our domestic surety and domestic management liability businesses. The increase in the surety net written premium was driven by a mix of relatively larger bonds in the quarter.","Turning to production in our domestic management liability businesses, we continue to execute our strategy to retain a substantial percentage of our high quality portfolio, while pursuing attractive new business. We are pleased that the retention came in at a record high of 89% for the quarter and that new business was strong up 11% from the first quarter last year. Renewal premium change of 3.6 points was up from the fourth quarter due to an increase in exposure.","So Bond & Specialty results were excellent and we continue to feel great about our growth and returns, as well as the opportunities that our strong market positions and competitive advantages present for the future.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Michael, who will talk to you about Personal Insurance.","Michael Klein","Thanks, Tom, and good morning everyone. Personal Insurance began the year by continuing to deliver on our objectives of improving auto profitability, while maintaining momentum in our homeowners business. Net written premiums of $2.3 billion grew 8%, once again driven by higher pricing primarily in auto and healthy growth in homeowners\u2019 policies enforce.","Personal Insurance segment income of $129 million was up from $89 million in the prior year quarter, with an improvement in the combined ratio to 97.5% primarily driven \u2013primarily due to higher favorable reserve development. Catastrophe losses contributed 9 points to the combined, an unusually high level for our first quarter, but similar to last year. On an underlying basis, improved profitability in auto was essentially offset by a higher level of non-cat weather losses in property.","Importantly, we remain pleased with the expense ratio of 26.8%. It\u2019s worth noting that the expense ratio for the segment has improved by about three-fold points from 2013, the year we announced the start of our cost reduction initiatives.","In Agency Auto, the combined ratio for the quarter was 94.8%, down considerably from the prior year quarter, due to a 2.3 point improvement in the underlying combined ratio driven by the rate actions taken in the past several quarters, along with the 2.3 point benefit from favorable prior year development. As a reminder, the first quarter combined ratio is typically a couple of points lower than average due to seasonality.","In Agency Homeowners, the first quarter combined ratio of 98.5%, included almost 21 points of cat losses and a benefit of 2.4 points from favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio of 80.2% was 2.6 points higher than the prior year quarter driven primarily by higher non-cat weather losses.","Turning to the top line, Agency Auto premiums grew by 9% and we\u2019re achieved 10 points of renewal premium change down slightly from the peak of 11 points last quarter, in line with our plans. Retention declined modestly as expected given the pricing actions and fifth levels in auto have been holding steady.","In Agency Homeowners & Other, premiums increased by 5%, demonstrating continued momentum with another quarter of a healthy fifth growth. Our efforts to maintain the steady increase in property policies enforce have been successful, even as we have intentionally slowed the fifth growth in auto.","As Alan mentioned, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we introduced our newest property product, Quantum Home 2.0 in three states, and so far the response from agents and customers is in line with our expectations. Early returns are demonstrating the benefits of Quantum Home 2.0\u2019s flexibility sophistication and ease of use. We\u2019ll roll out several more states during the second quarter and then continue with waves of five or so states at a time throughout 2018 and 2019. The gradual rollout and implementation should enable us to sustain the momentum we\u2019ve already generated and support profitable steady growth going forward.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Alan.","Alan Schnitzer","Thanks, Michael. Before I turn it back to Gabby to open it up for Q&A, I\u2019ll share with you that we\u2019ve just returned from our annual conference with our most significant distribution partners, who collectively represent about half of our premium. We all left with the continued confidence and the strength of our relationships with these business leaders in their firms and feeling tremendous support for the strategic initiatives that we have underway. It\u2019s a great reminder that our position with distribution is an important competitive advantage and one that\u2019s hard to replicate.","On a customer side, we also just returned from RIMS, the annual conference for the large account risk management community. We were honored to receive National Underwriters Risk Manager Choice Awards in five lines of business, the most of any company. Taken together, the feedback we\u2019re receiving from our customers, agents and brokers suggest that we\u2019re on the right track in our work to continue to lead the market in understanding risk in the products and services, our customers need and to provide them a great experiences.","Lastly, as some of you know, after a decade of leading Investor Relations for us, Gabby Nawi has been recruited away by our own Travelers Personal Insurance team to take a role in their finance group, which is great for her and great for us. Gabby\u2019s insight has been incredibly valuable to me and the entire leadership team. I\u2019m grateful and we all wish her continued success. We will be announcing her successor shortly.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. And thank you for those kind words. Chris, we\u2019re ready to start the Q&A portion.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan","Thank you. Good morning. First, congrats, Gabby, and I guess we\u2019ll miss you next quarter.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you, Kai.","Kai Pan","Yes. My first question is on pricing. If I do the math, first quarter increase in BI, 1.6%. But if you look by segments, Select Accounts is up point 2 and Middle Market, up 1.5, which implied maybe the National Property and others increased much more. So can you compare and contrast for us like the deceleration in term price increase in the small accounts. Why big increase in the national accounts?","Greg Toczydlowski","Hey Kai, this is this is Greg Toczydlowski. Good morning. Just answer the first part of that question. Yes, you\u2019re correct. The reason why the two of the businesses that are illustrated in the documents are below the total is because of the national property business. We\u2019ve been very successful in achieving rate, particularly in the cat exposed areas in National Property and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing when that rolls up into the total number.","In terms of Select, the second part of your question, we\u2019ve shared with you for some time now around how we\u2019ve been thinking about that business and how we\u2019ve been very focused to have an adequate set of returns in that business and we\u2019re very comfortable with the returns in that business right now. So that\u2019s a output of a lot of deliberate execution of really thoughtfully growing that business because we are returning the returns that are hit in our threshold today in that business. So that\u2019s what underneath that.","Kai Pan","Great. My follow-up question is for Alan. You mentioned performance transform in your annual letter. I just want to follow-up on the transform part. And could you tell us a bit more about initiatives, both internally as well as potential acquisitions on that front?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes. Sure, Kai. Thanks for the question. Thanks for reading the annual letter. I guess I\u2019ll refer you back to our Investor Day, and we discussed they are the \u2013 the forces have changed, we see impacting our business and they need to make sure that our competitive advantages continue to set us apart in the world that\u2019s obviously changing. We\u2019ve been incredibly successful over the last decade or two, and the competitive advantages we\u2019ve had has serviced us very well. But we\u2019re very mindful that what\u2019s going to make us successful over the next decade to some degree will be different than what\u2019s made us successful.","And so at a broad level, we\u2019ve set two objectives. We want to be the undeniable choice for the customer and we want to be an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers. And underneath that, we\u2019ve got three priorities that letter up to that. So one of the things that\u2019s made a successful for long time that\u2019s an expertise in risk and the products and services our customer\u2019s need that \u2013 that\u2019s we put them on a pedestal for a long time and we\u2019ll continue to put that on the pedestal and invest in that. So think data analytics, third-party data, that type of thing.","In addition, we are highly focused on the experience for our customers and our agents and brokers. And some of the technology and workflow investments you\u2019ve heard us talk about are designed to do that. And then third, productivity and efficiency. We\u2019re highly focused on just making sure that we\u2019ve got the ability to do more with less and that creates flexibility for us. It gives us the opportunity to take the output of the productivity and efficiency and either let that fall to the bottom line and invested in new or other strategic initiatives. We\u2019ll put in the price if we need to.","So there is a lot of things going on across the company in all three of our business segments, in our technology group, in claim. But all of the things that we\u2019re working on latter up really inside of that framework. And we\u2019ve talked about a lot of those specifically at Investor Day and I\u2019ll refer you back to that maybe for more specifics.","Kai Pan","Do you need acquisitions to transform the business?","Alan Schnitzer","So do we need acquisitions? I do not think we need acquisitions Kai, but nobody should take away from that that were not highly focused on it, right? I\u2019ve said for a long time and I\u2019ll continue to say that our shareholders should demand that we are active in terms of M&A. And that in the lines of business that we\u2019re interested in and the geographies we\u2019re interested in, we are very active and we are \u2013 we will continue to be.","We often say some of the best deals we do or the best deals we don\u2019t do, so we\u2019re highly disciplined about it. And we\u2019ve shared with you many times what the lens is for thinking about transactions, so we\u2019re anxious to do them. If they improve our return profile, if they lower volatility of if they provide another important strategic benefits for us. And so highly focused on looking at things that match up to that criteria. But no, we don\u2019t feel like we need to do it.","And I would say, Kai, that again if you shouldn\u2019t take away from this any change in propensity to think about or do a deal. But one of the things that we think more and more about today that maybe we didn\u2019t 5 years or 10 years ago is the opportunity cost and the potential distraction from focus on all the organic innovation that we\u2019re doing. We think it\u2019s really important in a changing world. We think that there\u2019s a real benefit to doing that. We\u2019ve got the resources, we\u2019ve got the talent, we\u2019ve got the intellect, we\u2019ve got a lack of distraction. And so we \u2013 again, you shouldn\u2019t take away any change of propensity to do a deal, but that\u2019s a wrinkle we think about when we assess M&A.","Kai Pan","Great. Thank you so much.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jay Cohen","Thank you. On the business Insurance side, will you talk about your retention being now, I guess, an all-time higher. Certainly, a multiple year high, is that the plan? I mean you\u2019ve got the balance obviously pricing, new business and retention. Do you feel as if that retention is getting up even too high? Or maybe what would be too high?","Greg Toczydlowski","Good morning, Jay. This is Greg. Yes, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking at the combination of retention, new business and rate all the time. But most of the time, it\u2019s not at the macro level of what we\u2019re looking at. It really is a very granular and local execution. We think we have a high-quality book of business, and so we like the retention of where it\u2019s at. We\u2019re very comfortable with that, and we\u2019re trying to retain that book as much as possible. Obviously, a competitive marketplace out there right now. But when you look at the combination of retention, new business and rate, we\u2019re comfortable with where all three of those are.","Jay Cohen","That\u2019s helpful, Greg. Thank you. Just one follow-up on Homeowners. The deterioration from the last year on the underlying number, you mentioned some of that or a lot of it was due to non-cat weather. Is it possible to quantify that relative to what you normally would expect?","Michael Klein","Sure, jay. This is Michael. I mean I think what I would say is when you look at cat and non-cat weather, first of all, you have to remember that the way that we parse that between one category and the other, the dollars can move from one bucket to another based on the magnitude and the type of the events we\u2019re experiencing. So it\u2019s a little bit artificial to give you a number for the non-cat weather variance. But round numbers, you can think of it as a sort of 1 point or 2 points in the quarter. But again, some of that is dependent upon the mix between cat events and non-cat events, but I would say 1 point or 2 points of adverse relative to expectations in the quarter.","Jay Cohen","Got it.","Jay Benet","If you\u2019re thinking about it across companies, you got to remember that we define cat \u2013 we draw the line in different places in terms of cat and non-cat.","Jay Cohen","Absolutely. But the good news is as you guys do it consistently, at least for yourself, so we can compare year-to-year.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes.","Jay Cohen","Thanks a lot.","Alan Schnitzer","Thanks for the question.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning. Two quick questions. The first question goes back, I guess, to the discussion on pricing. In your letter, you talk about the more significant factor being the low interest rates and loss cost inflation outpacing pricing gains. Would it be possible to get your view on interest rates and loss cost inflation with some specificity?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes. Amit, I\u2019m not sure \u2013 Good morning. I\u2019m not sure what specificity you\u2019re looking for. And what we\u2019ve consistently said, certainly in BI, is we think about loss trend as a four across the whole book. Obviously, different lines, different businesses have different loss trends in them, but over time, we think about it as a four.","Amit Kumar","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I guess what I was trying to ask if there is obviously a lot of debate amongst the investors with the rising interest rate and the near-term rise in the 10-year and how should they be thinking about loss cost. And has that changed your view versus, let\u2019s say, going into end of Q4? I guess that\u2019s what I was asking. Has there been any urgency in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about pricing versus loss cost. Or based on I guess your answer, there is no real change based on the long-term view? Is that a fair assertion?","Alan Schnitzer","I got it. I got your question. So I would say that despite where loss trends have been, we always assume that there is a return to more normal levels in inflation. So certainly, there\u2019s no sense of panic or urgency when generally what we\u2019ve been seeing is generally inside of our expectations. We see that CPI moving, but as you know from us, we\u2019re most heavily leveraged to medical wage and poor inflation. And sometimes that\u2019s good for us, right? When you\u2019ve got wage inflation, for example, that contributes to exposure in workers comp payrolls would be one example of that.","There\u2019s probably benefits on the investment income from a rising rate environment. To the extent that there is inflation that is contributing to loss cost. That wouldn\u2019t necessarily surprise us because we do expect some of that. What\u2019s important is what is inflation relative to our expectations and do we have that data analytics and know-how wherewithal to see it when it comes, and we think we do. So no sense of urgency. And I would say generally speaking across all of our businesses, more or less in line with expectations.","Amit Kumar","And okay, that\u2019s helpful. And my final question is going back to, I guess, Kai\u2019s question. In your letter, you talk about we will look for opportunities, et cetera, lower our volatility. Does that rule out, I guess, the reinsurance companies or hybrid companies making the cut? The reason why I ask is clearly, there\u2019s a lot of debate and discussion amongst the other companies. And then have you seen the validation excel question of that acquisitions? So I\u2019m just wondering would that be a non-starter based on your comments regarding the volatility? Or am I reading too much into the letter?","Alan Schnitzer","I think well, let me answer in two ways. Yes, I think you\u2019re reading too much into it and that we don\u2019t mean to include or exclude anything categorically. So I wouldn\u2019t read that to exclude anything. Having said that, I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019ve been pretty explicit over recently long period of time that just given our core capabilities and skill sets reinsurances and the business has been particularly attractive to us.","Amit Kumar","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for the answer. And good luck for the future and thanks, Gabby for all your help over the years.","Gabriella Nawi","Thanks, Amit.","Alan Schnitzer","Thanks, Amit.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. My first question, I\u2019m looking at the outlook in your 10-Q. You guys within Business Insurance point 2 renewal premium change and you compare it to last year same that it\u2019s going to be higher than the 2017 level. How do you see the back three quarters the year-endreference to the first quarter? And then also, if you can tie in your response to that question, did you see great momentum pick up as we went through the months? The quarter meaning was March rates higher than what you had seen in January?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes. Elyse, so the way we gave the outlook this period was to tell you that for the back three quarters of the year, it will be higher than the back three quarters of the prior year. And I think we leave it there and probably not comment on where it\u2019s going to come in relative to the first quarter. And yes, there was some pricing momentum quarter-to-quarter throughout the first quarter.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then my second question\u2026","Alan Schnitzer","I\u2019m sorry. Elyse, I\u2019m sorry. It increase month-to-month throughout the quarter is what I meant to say.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you. And then my second question, in terms of Business Insurance margin, you guys said that rate \u2013 earned rate was below trend in the quarter, in line with expectations. When you think about your outlook for the year and based off of the rate you\u2019re taking, when do you think in your mind earned rate should start to exceed trend?","Alan Schnitzer","There\u2019s a lot of estimation involved with that, Elyse, because there are some components of exposure that we consider to be economically like rate. So it\u2019s hard to give you the precise date or time at which that\u2019s going to happen, but I can tell you that we\u2019re getting, at least on a written basis, pretty close if not there already.","Elyse Greenspan","And in terms of exposure growth that you guys see more or less rate? Would that pick up in the quarter two within the renewal premium change?","Alan Schnitzer","I think exposure was pretty consistent positive, but pretty consistent throughout the quarter.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you very much.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. In Business Insurance, the underlying combined ratio deteriorated year-over-year. And I know you gave some insight on that. I was just hoping you can discuss it a little further, given the \u2013 I think the expectation for the full year was for it to be slightly better year-over-year.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes. So we give you beyond the underlying and its insurance. There\u2019s always going to be things that impact normal volatility and that\u2019s really what we saw. So let\u2019s call it about a point. About half of that was rate versus loss trend. And by the way, as Greg said, that\u2019s moderated. It\u2019s better than where it was in prior quarters and we think that\u2019s heading in the right direction, as I just said in answering lease\u2019s question. And the rest of it is just normal volatility on losses and expenses, and we see that from time to time. So think weather, think large losses, think mix. All the sorts of things that impact period to period volatility.","Jay Gelb","Okay. So you still think for the full year 2018 could be a better underlying in Business Insurance than 2017?","Alan Schnitzer","Well, we gave you the outlook and we set underlying margins higher compared to the prior year and underlying combined ratio slightly lower compared to same period to prior year.","Jay Gelb","I see, okay. On the pricing side, that was helpful to give the rate change ex-worker\u2019s comp, but workers\u2019 comp is a major portion of the premium volumes. So I\u2019m wondering should we expect, given the downward pressure on comp, any overall further improvement in the pace of rate in BI?","Alan Schnitzer","We do give you \u2013 well, I mean, we certainly give you the outlook in the 10-Q relative to the prior year. And as you heard me just say, we think it\u2019s going to continue to be higher year-over-year and I think we\u2019ll probably stop there.","Jay Gelb","Okay. And then just switching gears last question, on personal auto, PIF slow to 1% growth although profitability certainly improved. I\u2019m wondering if given the sharp slowdown in PIF growth. Could that go negative in personal auto?","Michael Klein","Thanks, Jay. It\u2019s Michael Klein. It certainly could. I think we would look at it and say, plus or minus a point or around flat is where we\u2019re anticipating it\u2019s going to bottom. And obviously, it will depend upon our rate actions relative to the market and how they are absorbed. But at least at this point, if it does go negative, we think it will be slightly and our objective would be to put the business \u2013 the auto book sort of back on the trajectory for growth towards late 2018.","Jay Gelb","Okay. Potentially, return to growth in late 2018. Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Great. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. I guess just keeping it on personal auto. If you could just maybe tell us about how the competitive environment has changed, I guess, in the first three months of the year, if there\u2019s been any change following the tax reform bill?","Michael Klein","I would say the competitive environments remain broadly consistent. We track predominantly our indicator for that would be tracking rate filings amongst our competitors, and we see a little bit of bouncing around there. And there was a little bit of a slowdown in competitor rate in the first quarter if you review competitive filings, but a lot of that has probably more to do with just the typical timing of when filings are made than it does anything to do with the impact of tax is on rate filings.","And I would just \u2013 maybe broaden that slightly and just say when you think about the tax impact on filed rate, particularly in auto, our perspective is that it closes the gap, but it doesn\u2019t eliminate it. The estimated industry combined ratio for auto stage is remained in 105 to 107 range, depending upon which estimates you look at. So think round numbers, at least a 10 point rate need for the industry there. And all else being equal, maybe tax reform drop at a couple of points, but it\u2019s not going to mitigate the rate need and won\u2019t be a key driver of reduced rate activity in the marketplace we don\u2019t think.","Ryan Tunis","That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess just \u2013 I guess on the BI side, going down into the normal volatility component of the combined ratio deterioration. Was that \u2013 would you said that was just related to property type losses? Or was there a casualty component as well? I mean, I\u2019m curious to see maybe an increased frequency in casualty related claims.","Greg Toczydlowski","Hey, Ryan, this is Greg. Just to echo Alan\u2019s earlier comments and to give you texture to your comment. It was a mix of different product lines, but predominantly was property. You can think about some of the extreme weather that we had in the first quarter and there would be a cat window of a certain period of time and you can think frozen pipes that extend beyond that window of time that is a large loss activity like that would be driving some of the volatility there.","Ryan Tunis","Got it. And then just one more on just the commercial auto. $50 million of adverse development. That\u2019s how if you\u2019ve been align, we\u2019ve identified as somewhat problematic. Just curious what you saw this quarter that maybe was different and led to the reserve addition.","Alan Schnitzer","Ryan, we obviously not a new story. We\u2019ve been watching it. We react to the data that we have. It\u2019s the line we are getting the most rate in, and we\u2019re underwriting for it. In the quarter, a little bit more severity on the smaller claims actually is what we saw.","Gabriella Nawi","Great, thank you. Next question and before we continue, so I can just remind you also limit yourself to one question and one follow-up please. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Josh Shanker","Thank you very much. I want to congratulate you, but also some questions on the dividends. You pointed out that over the past 14 years, it\u2019s gone up by 10%. But the last two years, the increase has been 7. How does the dividend policy relate to your view of EPS growth? And how do you consider cash flow from repurchases versus dividends? And I guess I\u2019m getting it finally, why the slowdown in the rate of the dividend growth?","Jay Benet","Hi, Josh. This is Jay. In looking at our dividends, we look at in relation to a number of things. One is what the dividend yield is and other is. What the payout ratio is. How that compares to others in the industry. And the science behind it as well as a lot of judgment. If you look back at where things were several years ago, balancing all that out. And also given the size of the decreases in the average number of shares outstanding because of all the buybacks, all of that translated into the actions that you saw before. With our stock price at the level that it\u2019s at now, even buying back the same dollar amount, we\u2019re buying back fewer shares.","So keeping the payout in terms of dollars somewhere in the $750 million to $800 million range, again, getting back to yield in payout ratios has caused us to look at something more in line with 7% as opposed to 10%. But we looked at what we think our future earnings are going to be or how we\u2019re relatively short period of time and make that determination.","Alan Schnitzer","Josh, I would just add to that. We understand that there\u2019s a component of our shareholder base that\u2019s looking for the dividend and we want to make sure that we\u2019re paying a competitive dividend rate for that component of our shareholder group. But this also insurance and there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, and we want to make sure that we\u2019ve set it at a level where under hopefully just about any foreseeable circumstance, we continue to pay the dividend and don\u2019t have to rethink it. So that, in addition to what Jay shared, those two factors play into the decision as well.","Greg Toczydlowski","And then I would add one other thing to what Alan just said that, as you know, we have an ongoing policy of returning capital that we don\u2019t need to support our business to the shareholders. So whether it\u2019s an increase in dividends or whether it\u2019s a share repurchases, all of the balances out to returning the excess capital and that\u2019s not changed.","Josh Shanker","Well, I appreciate the answers and I\u2019ll just add my sendoff regards to Gabby, but I hope she won\u2019t get stranger.","Gabriella Nawi","Thanks, Josh. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney. Please go ahead.","Larry Greenberg","Good morning and thank you. Just going back to auto, a good underlying loss ratio in the quarter recognizing there\u2019s some seasonality to the first quarter, but still looks strong. And when you look at that and then maybe in addition, the favorable development on the 2017 year. Is auto coming in a little bit better than you would have thought at this point?","Michael Klein","Larry, it\u2019s Michael. Thanks for the question. I would say autos coming in about where we expected. As I think Jay mentioned, we did have favorable prior year development in auto. But importantly, that was really driven mostly by catastrophes and loss adjustment expenses. So sort of more of a one-off driver of that PYD then sort of a change in our view of underlying dynamics. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the auto PYD in that commentary. But I would say broadly it\u2019s coming in about as expected, and we\u2019re pleased with it.","Larry Greenberg","Great, thanks. And then is there any color you could give, I guess this is for jay, on the non-fixed income piece of NII for the second quarter, given the lag in reporting that?","Jay Benet","I\u2019ll let Bill Heyman address that.","Bill Heyman","Hi, this is Bill. Are you talking about the quarter, the quarter that we are currently in? Or about the quarter just ended, which is the first quarter.","Larry Greenberg","Yes, I\u2019m talking about the quarter we\u2019re in.","Bill Heyman","Well, only about 20 days into it. And historically, we have not really commented on what we\u2019re seeing. So I think I\u2019m going to keep to that.","Gabriella Nawi","Great. Next question please.","Alan Schnitzer","Larry, are we missing the question?","Larry Greenberg","Excuse me.","Alan Schnitzer","Are we missing the question? If you\u2019re asking about the second quarter, obviously, we couldn\u2019t comment on that. But are we missing the question about the first quarter?","Larry Greenberg","No, no, no, I\u2019m sorry. Just I given that I think your non-fixed income is reported on a quarter lag or depending a few months \u2013 a couple of months lag. We saw a bit of volatility in the first quarter\u2026","Alan Schnitzer","I think, we probably have too many discrete GP relationships to combine them and give you anything meaningful.","Larry Greenberg","Fair enough, thank you.","Alan Schnitzer","Thanks, Larry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.","Meyer Shields","Thanks, good morning. The general administrative expenses in both BI and PI was up faster than it had been in previous quarters. And also can you explain what\u2019s going on?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes. Good morning, Meyer. So let me start with a total and I\u2019m happy to go further into the segments, but simply business and FX would be about half of it for the total. And the other half, now we\u2019re getting into a relatively small dollars on the total G&A base. Other half would be timing. So extrapolating out to the segments per Business Insurance, most of it gets explained through Simply Business and through FX. In Personal Insurance, it\u2019s variability and contingent commissions and then some timing.","Meyer Shields","Okay, great. And then question, I think predominately personalized, but maybe not. When so nationwide obviously that they are going to an independent agency distribution model, how does Travelers plan to respond to that in terms of the growth opportunities?","Michael Klein","Thanks, Meyer. It\u2019s Michael. I\u2019ll take it and I think you\u2019re right. It could be broader than BI, but I\u2019ll sort of address that broadly. First, they did recently announce that they\u2019re making those changes, but it\u2019s important to know that it\u2019s not a brand new initiative for them. So certainly, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all well aware that through Harvey [indiscernible] they trade with independent agents already as a corporation.","But even underneath the nationwide brand, they\u2019ve had a number of nationwide captive agents that have had access to the independent agent market already. And in fact, they have an operation called nationwide broker services that those captive agents can access other markets through, and Travelers is one of many companies that actually trade with that brokerage services organization. So a, it\u2019s not brand-new. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve seen and been monitoring. And in fact, it\u2019s a trading relationship that we have. I would say on balance, we have a couple of observations.","First of all, Alan mentioned our strength with independent agent distribution. As a franchise, we think that\u2019s a continued competitive advantage for us and it is our primary focus in terms of distribution. But I would say that we primarily view this change as an opportunity to explore additional distribution points. We will certainly monitor and evaluate nationwide\u2019s performance with independent agents as we monitor and evaluate any competitors, results in the independent agent channel. But again, on balance, we\u2019d say something that\u2019s been developing for a while and on the margin probably more an opportunity than a threat.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Thanks very much. And good luck, all and Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on your latest thoughts on U.S. tax reform and the impact of competition. And given you\u2019ve seen in other industries like mortgage insurance, you saw one company pass along the entire benefit to customers. Does that change your view now at all about the impact on competition and pricing?","Jay Benet","Hi, good morning, Sarah. No, it really doesn\u2019t. We\u2019ve said pretty consistently that we\u2019ve got some ground to cover in tax reform helps, but it doesn\u2019t close the GAAP. And you really have to look at our pricing objectives holistically. So you\u2019ve got to take into account capital requirements and the adequacy of expiring prices and loss trend and the tax rate. We put all those things into the blender and what comes out is as we look ahead rate need. So we continue to think current course and speed.","And from a market perspective, again, I\u2019ll just remind you that not the whole market benefits from tax reform. You\u2019ve got both U.S. and domestic insurers who are positioned differently from a tax perspective. And even among U.S. competitors, those that don\u2019t have significant underwriting profit or underlying lost don\u2019t benefit to the same degree as those within underwriting profit. So it\u2019s not like the entire P&C business. The trades in the U.S. is all of a sudden flush and returns are \u2013 I think, at target levels.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay. Great, thanks. And then just following-up on the Business Insurance pricing, I think you\u2019ve talked about previously pushing for price increases to keep pace with loss inflation, which is about 4%. But do you think you can get there if you are keeping Select Accounts flat? It seems like you would need a lot of price increase in the other subsegments of Business Insurance and I\u2019m just wondering to what extent that\u2019s achievable?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, Sarah. So it\u2019s sort of a broad aspirational comment that we would like pricing to keep up with loss trend. We think that makes sense, but we don\u2019t execute for that headline numbers, right. We look at every account. We look at the circumstances of that account and sign a rate need to it and then try to achieve that. And what you heard, Greg say, is what we did, on the small end, was the function of deliberate execution, given where the returns are. So you got that factor, you\u2019ve got workers\u2019 comp, you\u2019ve got all sorts of things that will drive the headline number. As a reminder though, we\u2019re really executing on account by account basis.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Yaron Kinar","Hi, good morning everybody. First question on Business Insurance and renewal rate change there. So just given the momentum you\u2019ve seen months over months during the quarter and the fact that less of your workers\u2019 comp or I guess less of the renewals will be workers\u2019 comp waited. And the remaining three quarters of the year, would it be fair to expect maybe for the acceleration of the rate change?","Alan Schnitzer","I\u2019m not sure we agree with the workers\u2019 comp waiting observation by the way. I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true. I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s going to be a significant driver. And this in terms of outlook, Yaron, we give you a perspective in the Outlook sections of the 10-Q and we\u2019re probably not going to go beyond that. So I hope that\u2019s helpful.","Yaron Kinar","With regards to waiting, I was just referring to the 37% of workers\u2019 comp renews in the first quarter as opposed to 20 some the rest of the year. And I guess, the other question I had was just with regards to the large non-cat weather losses. So if those remain at the level we\u2019ve seen this quarter. Are you still comfortable with the guidance outlook for the year in terms of margin improvement in Business Insurance?","Alan Schnitzer","The guidance that we give you, one is an underlying basis, so it excludes cats. And two, we do say exclusively in the 10-Q, that it assumes a return to lower more normal levels of whether and other loss activity. So we are assuming a return to more normal levels.","Yaron Kinar","Okay, thank you very much.","Gabriella Nawi","And this will be our last question please.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. So drilling down on the Business Insurance pricing just little bit more here. Can you talk about how you\u2019ve kind of saw \u2013 it improved I guess, month-to-month you said. But if you were thinking about kind of what the pricing environment look like. We had your fourth quarter conference call to today. Is it in line, better, worse than you kind of we\u2019re expecting it to competitive pressures maybe a little bit more or less?","Alan Schnitzer","It\u2019s probably finer than we want to parse it. We start getting into competitively sensitive information there. So that\u2019s probably finer than we want to parse it. I did say in my remarks that we did achieve rate gains more broadly across accounts. That\u2019s true and that\u2019s a trend that \u2013 I think it was quarter-to-quarter throughout the year and probably going back five quarters or so. So I will share that color, but parsing it beyond that probably more detail than we want to provide.","Brian Meredith","Great. And then last question here. If I look at the exposure change and you\u2019ve talked about how that exposure change, there\u2019s part of it that actually has an impact on margins. Is there kind of a general kind of percentage of that, that we should think as part of margins? Is it half of it? Is it two-thirds of it?","Alan Schnitzer","We\u2019ve always resisted and giving that, because there\u2019s so much estimation involved. So all we said is that it\u2019s not insignificant, but we\u2019ve stopped sort of really quantifying that.","Brian Meredith","Thanks. Keep it to try, thanks.","Alan Schnitzer","Thanks you.","Gabriella Nawi","Okay, thank you all for joining us today. And it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you all over the last 10 years. And I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll hear from you again soon. Have a great day, and thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"21234":["The Travelers Companies, Inc.

We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on July 23, 2019.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.","Abbe Goldstein","Thank you so much and good morning. Welcome to Travelers discussion of our second quarter 2019 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.","Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three Segment Presidents, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take your questions.","Before I turn the call over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of our webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance.","Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.","Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. The overall results for the quarter were solid, benefiting from the continued successful execution of our strategic agenda. We said for years that the primary measure we use for managing the business is return on equity and we've also said that any strategy to deliver leading return on equity over time requires a strategy to grow over time.","To that end, a few years ago, we laid out a strategy to achieve profitable growth in the context of the forces of change we've previously identified impacting our industry. We established key innovation priorities and invested in capabilities consistent with those priorities. The successful execution of that strategy has contributed to growth over the past several years and contributed to the growth in earnings this quarter. Earned premiums were up 4% to almost $7 billion, adding meaningfully to underwriting income in the quarter.","We've also shared that improving productivity and efficiency is a priority and efforts we've been undertaking for some time to leverage technology investments and workflow enhancements are paying off. Again, this quarter and year-to-date, we've grown the top line and managed general and administrative expenses to about flat, while continuing to make important investments in the business.","All of that, together with strong performance from our investment portfolio, contributed to core income of $537 million, a 9% increase over the prior year quarter and core income per diluted share of $2.02, a 12% increase over the prior year. Core return on equity was 9.2%.","In terms of underwriting margins, this quarter we delivered a solid all-in combined ratio of 98.4%. As a reminder, our expected weather losses are seasonally highest in the second quarter. But as you can see on page 4 of the webcast, the underlying combined ratio was up 1.3 points over the prior year quarter.","There were a number of favorable items impacting the underlying results, including a lower level of large losses and improved expense leverage. But I'd like to highlight and put in context two items contributing to the increase; non-catastrophe weather losses and some continued deterioration of trends in the tort environment.","I'll start with the weather which, of the two, had the larger impact. For the quarter, total weather losses in the aggregate, cat and non-cat, were well within the range of what we would consider normal. But breaking that down, catastrophe losses were favorable, while non-cat weather losses were worse than what we would consider a normal level for the second quarter. That resulted in a nearly 2-point increase in the underlying combined ratio compared to the prior year quarter. Again, all-in weather losses weren't far off what we planned for, so we consider this bucketing.","In terms of the tort environment, the trends we discussed in the fourth quarter of last year impacting bodily injury severity in Commercial Auto have developed a little worse than we expected in the Commercial Auto line. And while we anticipated those trends extending into the other liability coverages, they extended into the primary and excess coverages of the general liability line somewhat more than we anticipated. That drove the adjustment this quarter.","On the whole and looking back over the last three quarters, the issues continued to be most heavily associated with Commercial Auto related losses, manifesting in two places, in the Commercial Auto line, as you would expect, and also in excess coverages of the general liability line, where the underlying losses are auto related.","The run rate earnings impact of this updated view of the tort environment is a little less than $20 million per quarter after tax. The current quarter underlying result also included a catch up of about the same amount from development of the first quarter. The aggregate impact of the first and second quarter adjustments added around two-thirds-of-a-point of the consolidated underlying combined ratio, which amounts to about $0.14 per share. Also, I'll note that unlike Commercial Auto, where the returns are still clearly inadequate, the returns in the general liability line, both primary and excess are much healthier for us.","Turning to the topline. Production was once again excellent in the quarter. We grew net written premiums by 4% to a record $7.5 billion. Our premium growth reflects high levels of retention and positive renewal premium change broadly across the portfolio. As I pointed out before, that speaks to the high quality of the business we're putting on the books. We're growing our new and renewal business with confidence in terms of accounts, geographies and industries that we know well.","In Business Insurance, we achieved renewal premium change of 6.7%, including renewal rate change of 3.6%. In both cases, the highest level since five years, while maintaining historically high levels of retention. We increased renewal rate change and renewal premium change both year-over-year and sequentially in each of our product lines other than workers' compensation.","In our leading Bond & Specialty business, we once again achieved strong production in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses, with a record levels of retention and new business in domestic Management Liability.","In Personal Insurance, higher net written premiums benefited from renewal premium increases in both our Agency Automobile and Agency Home businesses and an all-time high for domestic new business. We have momentum in all of our businesses. And in an environment of persistently low interest rates, ongoing uncertainty surrounding weather-related losses and continuing challenges in the tort environment, we will continue to leverage the power of franchise to meet our return objectives, including by continuing to selectively and thoughtfully seek pricing and improved terms and conditions. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Tom and Michael about our segment results.","To sum it up, our performance this quarter and year-to-date reflect both the successful execution of our long-term strategy and our relentless execution in the marketplace every day. With leading data and analytics in the hands of our frontline underwriters, the best talent in the industry and deep relationships with our agents and brokers, we remain well positioned to continue to deliver shareholder value over time.","And with, that I'll turn it over to Dan.","Dan Frey","Thank you, Alan. Core income for the second quarter was $537 million, up 9% from $494 million in the prior year quarter and core ROE was 9.2%, up from 8.7%. Earnings per share and core earnings per share were up 9% and 12% respectively. Our second quarter results include $367 million of pretax catastrophe losses, down from $488 million in last year's quarter, but the lower level of cat losses was more than offset by higher levels of non-cat weather.","As we have previously disclosed, our definition of catastrophes is limited to industry events where our losses exceed a specified dollar amount generally around $20 million. In the second quarter, a larger portion of the weather losses we experienced fell below our cat threshold and thus adversely impacted our underlying combined ratio. But again, as you heard from Alan, overall weather results, cat and non-cat combined were well within the range of what we would expect.","In terms of weather expectations, during our fourth quarter earnings call, we explained that our expectations for cat losses for 2019 would trend up for two reasons. One is that we've seen growth in our premium volume and the overall exposure level in the business. Two, is that we're replacing a little more weight on recent periods and that results in a bit of an uptick in terms of our view of normal cat load per dollar premium. Adding the seasonality of our cat losses in our second quarter total weather results were no surprise.","Pretax underlying underwriting gain, which excludes the impacts of cats in prior year reserve development decreased by 19%. Higher non-cat weather-related losses adversely impacted the underlying combined ratio of 94.9% by nearly two points compared to the prior year quarter. Also, and to a lesser degree, the change in the underlying combined ratio was impacted by several favorable items, including lower large losses and improved expense leverage, partially offset by a modest impact from the continuing challenges in the tort environment as Alan mentioned. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the second quarter was $123 million pretax, down from $186 million in the prior quarter.","In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD was $71 million. In terms of highlights, the net favorability resulted primarily from better-than-expected performance in workers' comp, which improved by about $275 million. Partially offsetting the favorability in workers' comp is unfavorable development of approximately $125 million in general liability for both primary and excess coverages and Commercial Auto. This represents the estimated impact of the continuing challenges in the tort environment that drove the nearly $20 million of after-tax run rate increase in the current quarter's underlying losses.","Second quarter PYD in Business Insurance also included a $60 million increase to environmental reserves for accident years prior to 2010. As a follow-up to last quarter, second quarter PYD also included a modest impact, resulting from a handful of additional states, extending the statute of limitations for molestation claims. The impact on our book from these legislative changes in the second quarter was much smaller than the first quarter impact from the adoption of similar legislation in New York.","In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable PYD of $39 million was driven by domestic Management Liability. In Personal Insurance, net favorable PYD of $13 million was driven by favorability in our domestic businesses. Last week, the U.K. updated the Ogden rate, which is the discount rate applied to lump sum bodily injury payouts. The rate change was modest, and as a result we expect to book only a small benefit in the third quarter.","Net investment income increased by 8% from the prior year quarter to $548 million after tax as higher fixed income returns were complemented by higher returns in our non-fixed income portfolio. Fixed income NII increased by $25 million after tax, due to the higher-average yield on invested assets and an increase in the amount of average invested assets. Higher returns in the private equity portfolio reflected the broader market recovery.","Looking forward with interest rate expectations now lower than they were three months ago, we have updated our outlook and now expect after-tax fixed income NII for the remainder of 2019, to increase by approximately $10 million to $15 million per quarter compared to the same period a year ago.","As we discussed on our earnings calls for the last two quarters, we added a new catastrophe reinsurance treaty for 2019 providing coverage for PCS-designated events for which we incur $5 million or more in losses, above an aggregate retention of $1.3 billion. While the impact on written premiums was reflected entirely in the first quarter, the new treaty impacts all four quarters on an earned basis.","For the second quarter, the impact of the treaty increased our consolidated underlying combined ratio by about 0.5 point as expected. Through June 30, we've accumulated a little less than $800 million towards the $1.3 billion retention. As you think about the elevated non-cat weather this quarter, it's important to keep in mind that much of that weather activity was from non-PCS events that did not count towards the treaty.","On the topic of reinsurance, I'll direct your attention to page 20 of the webcast and provide an update on our catastrophe reinsurance program. The structure of our cat reinsurance treaty is generally consistent with the prior year. We renewed our Northeast Cat Treaty effective July 1st with substantially similar terms and flat pricing. Our cat bond Long Point Re III is in the second year of its four-year term. And in the annual reset for the 2019 hurricane season, the attachment point was adjusted from $1.9 billion to $1.79 billion, while the total cost of the program was flat year-over-year.","A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage, which also includes a description of our gen cat, aggregate EXOL treaties that covers in the accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences is included in our 10-Q, which we filed earlier today and in our 2018 10-K.","Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.2 billion were again very strong all our capital ratios were at or better-than-target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. Net unrealized investment gains increased from $1 billion after tax as of March 31 to $1.9 billion after tax as of June 30 due to the decrease in interest rates during the quarter.","Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $90.05 at June 30, 3% higher than at year-end and 6% higher than the end of the second quarter last year. We returned nearly $600 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $376 million and dividends of $217 million. On a year-to-date basis we have returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn the mic over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.","Greg Toczydlowski","Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced segment income of $351 million for the quarter and a combined ratio of 101.1%. The combined ratio includes catastrophe losses, which were essentially in line with our expectations for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 97.4% was 0.9 points higher than the prior year quarter. There are several moving pieces underneath the 0.9 point year-over-year change, so we've added page 9 to the webcast to illustrate the components.","I'll start with the notable items that increased the underlying combined ratio year-over-year. The most significant item was non-cat weather, which was higher than the prior year quarter by about a point. Next, are two items that we've discussed with you previously, the first is the 0.5 point impact from lower earned premium due to the new cat treaty, and the second is the approximately 0.5 point run rate impact related to the Q4 2018 re-estimation of Commercial Auto losses.","The last of the unfavorable adjustments relates to further deterioration of the trends related to the continuing challenges in the tort environment that drove the re-estimation of Commercial Auto losses in the fourth quarter as you heard from Alan. The most recent data showed loss experience that was somewhat higher than our revised expectations from the fourth quarter. This included further modest deterioration in auto and extended into general liability for both primary and excess coverage's to a higher degree than we had previously anticipated.","For these adjustments, there is about 0.5 point of ongoing run rate impact and about 0.5 point of catch-up from the first quarter of 2019. As for the favorable year-over-year items, first, we had about 1.5 point from domestic large losses returning to a more normal level as we expected. And second, we had about 0.5 point driven by continued benefit from higher earned premium volumes and disciplined expense management. Importantly, we continue to achieve this expense leverage, while investing in strategic initiatives that position us for the future.","Now to the top line. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 2% over the prior year driven by strong underlying production results. Partially offsetting the production results were some items that were generally timing in nature. For example, we changed the timing of one of our reinsurance treaties from the first quarter to the second quarter. Adjusting for those items, the top line trends were in line with recent quarters.","In terms of domestic production, we achieved strong renewal premium change of 6.7% in the quarter, including renewal rate change of 3.6% both their highest level in five years. The renewal rate change was up 1.3 points from the first quarter and more than 1.5 points from the second quarter of last year. This is a strong result particularly given continued rate decreases in workers' comp. While the Commercial Auto and Property lines continue to lead the way, our general liability both primary and access as well as C&P lines also saw meaningful increases.","Importantly, at the same time as we achieved these pricing increases remained historically high retention of 85%. Last quarter, we said that in addition to price, we've also been focused on improving terms and conditions particularly in our property coverages. In this quarter, terms and conditions, things like deductibles, sub-limits and insurance-to-value tightened further contributing to rate adequacy.","Even after our updated view of loss trend resulting from our re-estimation of losses in the auto and general liability lines, which increased our overall view of domestic loss trend by about 0.5 point, we estimate that pricing that is rate plus the portion of exposure that acts like rate was an excess of loss trend on a written basis for the quarter.","New business of $531 million in total was essentially flat to a strong prior year quarter. We're very pleased with our production results and our continued granular and deliberate execution.","As you heard from Alan, given the low interest rate environment, continued uncertainty around weather-related losses and some upward pressure from the tort environment, we'll continue to seek rate and use all the other available levers to meet our return objectives. As for the individual businesses, in select renewal premium change, the renewal rate change both ticked up from the first quarter, while retention remained strong at 82%.","New business was strong in comparable to the prior year quarter. We're pleased with the returns in this business and these production results reflect our strategic execution.","In middle market, renewal premium change was 6.1% with renewal rate of 3.4%, up more than a point from the first quarter and 1.6 points from the second quarter of last year, while retention remained historically high at 87%.","New business premiums of $275 million were down from a strong prior year quarter. For the most part, we attribute the new business dynamic to our underwriters prioritizing improving price, terms and conditions at renewal and being disciplined in managing risk selection related to our exposure to the auto line. We're very comfortable with our execution. We continue to invest in our strategic capabilities and are confident that we're well positioned to profitably grow over time.","Page 18 of the webcast shows production statistics for our international markets across all three of Travelers' segments. Although, these statistics include more than Business Insurance, the overall trends are consistent with what we're seeing for the BI portion of international and reflect the rate risk selection, risk control and other measures we continue to execute to improve profitability.","Lastly, I'd like to touch on our National Property business, which had a notable increase in new business this quarter. In this space, we've been seeing more opportunities in the marketplace and we've been selectively writing some of that. Importantly, many are accounts that we quoted or written before, so we're familiar with them and we're writing them at prices and on terms and conditions that meet our discipline standards.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Kunkel","Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered another quarter of strong results. Segment income was $174 million, a decrease of $30 million due to a lower level of net favorable prior year development. The combined and underlying combined ratios were an excellent 74.9% and 81% respectively.","Net written premiums for the quarter were up a very strong 9% with solid growth across all businesses. Considering the high quality of our Management Liability portfolio, we are pleased that the domestic retention remained at a historically high 90% with renewal premium change higher at 4.2%.","New business for the quarter was a record $65 million, up 20% from the prior year quarter. These results reflect a successful execution of our various marketing, product and underwriting strategies to profitably grow these lines.","Domestic Surety net written premiums were up 4% over a very strong prior year quarter. Our existing portfolio remains well positioned to continue to provide leading returns over time and our competitive advantages allow us to thoughtfully and selectively add quality new accounts. So Bond & Specialty results were strong and we feel terrific about our marketplace execution, competitive advantages and our ability to continue to deliver excellent results.","And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.","Michael Klein","Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. Personal Insurance grew income, revenue and policies in force in the second quarter with improved performance in both auto and home.","Segment income for the second quarter of 2019 increased $105 million relative to the second quarter of 2018. Our combined ratio for the quarter was 100.2% an improvement of 4.7 points over the prior quarter, driven primarily by catastrophe levels that were nearly 7 points below last year.","The underlying combined ratio of 94.6% was up 2 points from the prior year quarter driven by an increase in non-catastrophe weather losses and the impact on earned premiums related to the new Catastrophe Reinsurance Treaty partially offset by earned pricing net exceeded loss trend in agency automobile and a lower underwriting expense ratio.","Weather losses in the aggregate were better than the prior year quarter and we're pleased with the overall results. Recall that the second quarter is our seasonally highest quarter in terms of expected weather losses.","Turning to the top line, net written premiums for the quarter grew 6% with Agency Homeowners & Other leading the way with growth of 11%. Personal Insurance had strong retention in renewal premium change and record new -- domestic new business for the quarter.","Agency Automobile once again delivered strong results with a combined ratio of 94% for the quarter, a 1.4 point improvement from the prior year period. The quarter benefited from a lower underlying combined ratio and lower catastrophe losses partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio continued to benefit from earned pricing that exceeded loss trend including continued favorable frequency trends.","In Agency Homeowners & Other the second quarter combined ratio was 104.5%, 9.1 points lower than the prior quarter due to lower catastrophe losses and higher net -- favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by a higher underlying combined ratio.","Higher non-catastrophe weather losses were the main driver of the 7.7 point increase in the underlying combined ratio to 92.9% as compared to the prior year quarter. While weather in total was favorable relative to the prior year quarter, a significant component of the weather activity came from non-PCS events this quarter in addition to PCS events that did not meet our catastrophe threshold.","Turning to quarterly production. Agency Automobile retention remained solid at 84% with renewal premium change of 4.6% and a modest increase in new business from the prior year quarter. We remain focused on actions to grow this book at returns that continue to meet our objectives.","Agency Homeowners & Other delivered another strong quarter. We achieved renewal premium change of 6.7% up 1.4 points from the first quarter and up 3 points from the second quarter of last year with retention remaining strong at 86%. The pricing we achieved reflects actions we're taking to address the higher loss activity that we and the industry have experienced in recent periods.","New business was up 26% driven by our successful rollout of Quantum Home 2.0. QH2 continues to be well received and is performing as expected driven by sophisticated pricing segmentation and the ability for agents and customers to easily tailor the product to meet their needs.","During the quarter we continue to make investments in the business. For example, we rolled out QH2.0 in three more states and the District of Colombia and QH2 is now available in 28 states. We remain on-track to complete the rollout in most of the remaining states later this year.","In addition we announced several new initiatives. First, we've partnered with American Forests, the oldest National Conservation Organization in the U.S. to plant up to one million trees in connection with our initiative to encourage more customers to enroll in paperless billing, resulting in more efficiency for us, a better experience for them all while benefiting the environment.","Second we're working with Wildfire Defense Systems to help provide loss prevention services in California that supplement local firefighters and other first responders in the event of a wildfire.","This new service gives California policyholders an added layer of wildfire protection at no additional premium. It is also an additional tool to help us manage our exposure. These are the latest examples of initiatives that continue to position us well to deliver value in the eyes of the customer and to grow profitably while investing in the business.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.","Abbe Goldstein","Thanks Michael. And thank you. We're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line is open. ","Jay Gelb","Thanks and good morning. I'm sure people are going to have a fair amount of questions on the underlying combined ratio shift in 2Q year-over-year. I really think you explained it well in terms of the impact of non-cat weather and the tort environment deteriorating.","I am wondering given the pace of price improvement, do you think at some point over the course of the rest of 2019 or 2020, we could see underlying margin improvement given how those trends are unfolding?","Alan Schnitzer","You know, Jay, we give you an outlook for the underlying underwriting margin in the Outlook section of the 10-Q and we do it by segment. So you can see there -- what it is that we're thinking going forward. In particular where -- in BI where we're calling for continued improvement really it's three things it's non-cat weather, it's -- we would expect improved results in international.","And in the fourth quarter of last year you've got the timing impact of the fourth quarter auto adjustments, but there is a lot of levers we have to pull to manage overall margins and profitability and including price terms and conditions and we're working on all those things relentlessly in the market every day and that will impact premium that we put on books and that also will earn in over time.","Jay Gelb","All right. That's helpful. Thanks. All right so expectations of continued improvement. And then I was wondering if you might have the rate impact or the rate benefit in domestic Business Insurance excluding the -- what I would imagine is a drag from workers' comp?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, Jay workers\u2019 comp continued to be negative in the quarter. And we have given that as a separate statistic from time-to-time. We do it when we think it's relevant and we need to do it to clarify one thing or another. But there is some competitive sensitivity there and we don't intend to continue to update that number and probably would prefer not to give it to you now. But clearly the numbers that you see for rate in RPC and BI would be higher, but for workers' comp which is negative.","Jay Gelb","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you, Jay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Mike Phillips","Thanks. Good morning. Two questions. First on the personal line side Agency Auto. I'm sure you saw a pretty decent expansion there of your core margin. And if I am reading correctly it sounds like your outlook calls for consistent levels of profitability into 2020. So I guess, could you talk about what you're seeing on the competitive environment sounds like it might be more competitive now than it was last year and sounds like if you're looking for consistent -- what is the profitability you're not concerned then with any rising in physical damage severity impacts in your margins there?","Michael Klein","Sure, Mike. This is Michael Klein. I would say on the competitive environment we talked about it the last couple of quarters we certainly see as you can also find a moderation in rate increases being filed by our competitors. I think broadly speaking it's in pattern with the methods that we've been sending that we're moderating rate in response to the improved profitability. And I think we're working to be in step with the marketplace there.","In terms of loss trend, we do continue to see upward pressure on severity in personal auto more than offset over the last couple of quarters with improvements in frequency. I think what we're working to do is to balance our pricing with the long-term view or trend over time and the outlook reflects the fact that we think we can do that and shift a little bit more growth in auto at attractive margins. So that's the view on our outlook.","The one exception inside the outlook you'll note that we talk about the fourth quarter in particular and so I'll just remind you that as you look at the fourth quarter of 2019 and the comparison to 2018 there is a challenging year-over-year comparison there because we had both very strong quarter in terms of profitability in the quarter and in the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized some of the favorable loss trend that we had been seeing throughout 2018. So there was a good guide catch-up in the fourth quarter of 2018. So broadly consistent with the exception of the fourth quarter which is really just a year-over-year comparison challenge.","Mike Phillips","Okay. Great. Thank you, Michael for the details there. Switching over then to workers comp you mentioned this time reserve development was from multiple accident years. I guess, one was there anything from accident year 2018 and anything from the first quarter of 2019 in that? And then, I guess, secondly on comp -- some competitors were talking about changing in loss trends maybe slightly getting worse and California recently came up with some uptick in severity in California. So I guess at what point do you become concerned on pretty substantial margin pressure in that line?","Dan Frey","So Mike, its Dan Frey. I'll take at least the first part of it on PYD, sort of, to clarify right so there wouldn't be anything in PYD from the first quarter of 2019. We'd count that as current year and we'd have called it out if there was a significant catch-up there. You k now, with the long-tail nature of workers' comp the majority of our prior year reserves development is going to have to come from years prior to 2018 just because you have a better chance to see how those were seasoning, but there is a small piece from 2018 as we see the favorability in some of the older years continue to bid into 2018.","Alan Schnitzer","Mike, its Alan. On the loss trend of workers' comp -- I'd say broadly speaking it continues to behave well.","Mike Phillips","Okay. Thank you very much.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Mike Zaremski","Hey, good morning. Couple of questions. First, probably for Greg. In your prepared commentary, I believe you said in addition to price you're getting tightened terms and conditions. If that's correct just want to clarify whether your disclosure of pricing changes is taking into account terms and conditions tightening as well?","Greg Toczydlowski","Yeah. Terms and conditions is all net inside our book of business yield. When we talk about terms and conditions, we're predominantly seeing that on the larger portion of the property segment. So think insured value, thing deductibles, all peril deductibles, sub-limits, so that's where we're seeing some of those terms and conditions improvement. So as we make those changes on the renewal block that certainly has an impact from a favorable point of view from a loss cost net on the book of business.","Alan Schnitzer","Mike are you asking whether that's somehow adjusted in the rate number, is that your question?","Mike Zaremski","Yeah. If it's mathematically taken into account within the disclosure rate.","Alan Schnitzer","It's not mathematic, I mean the rate numbers are pretty pure just price calculation, although to some extent it could show up on the exposure side, right? So if deductibles went up for example that would be negative for exposure, but it would not factor into the pure rate calculation.","Mike Zaremski","Okay. That's helpful. I may follow-up. And lastly on tort inflation, would you say it's gaining momentum in terms of the inflation rates? And do you think there are any underlying causes, I believe litigation finance there is a bunch of \u2013 there\u2019s couple of public firms and there's been a lot of capital raises there over the last couple of years and its gaining momentum as an asset class maybe that's one of the underlying drivers. If you have any thoughts there that would be helpful? Thanks.","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah. So it's -- so what we're describing is the result of squaring triangles and coming up with numbers and then looking for causal factors in the environment. So there's a fair amount of estimation here and it's not -- there is no math formula that gets us to the answer to that question necessarily.","But I would say broadly what we're reflecting in our numbers, we would describe it as a more active and more aggressive plaintiffs' bar. Now litigation finance is its own topic and we certainly read about, we can see numbers on that. We know more money is being raised for that as an asset class. We don't dismiss that as a factor.","I will tell you that that is one aspect that at least now, this could change but at least now we're not seeing that as a particularly significant driver in what we're referring to as change in the tort environment. That could come. I mean we see the funds being raised for that. And so -- and by the way to the extent we see that and anticipate it that would get reflected in our loss PIKs as well, but we're not seeing that as a standout issue.","Mike Zaremski","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. My first question going back to the Commercial Auto and GL PIKs that went up in the quarter. I guess what I'm trying to tie together is, A; the increase that you guys saw there and then also the commensurate increase in rate. So do you -- can you try to bucket I guess, how much of the rate was driven in your view off of just this higher loss trend environment because when we think about going forward it does sound like you guys are a bit more positive on pricing inflecting relative to loss trend in terms of just thinking about your outlook but if trend keeps going up that's going to, obviously, offset that rate versus trend phenomena?","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah. So, Elyse we did give you some perspective on outlook for RPC in the Outlook section of the 10-Q. And certainly everything we know about loss trend goes into our pricing models and our view of rate adequacy and our view what rate we need to achieve our return objectives.","I will say that that does come in on a lag basis. We've got to see it, we've got to put it through in our models to the extent there are regulatory filings there's a process there then you got to put it on the book it's got a earn in. So there is a lag between the recognition of these trends and the time price goes into the market and gets -- is put on the books.","So it's a long way of saying that Commercial Auto was at an inadequate return before we saw some of these trends it just got worse. And I think to a large degree, the pricing that we're seeing now is reflective of longer term trends in Commercial Auto, although some of what we're seeing in the quarter will be reflective of recent trends.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then my second question, so you guys said the increase PIKs are about $20 million going forward that's about 50 basis points within Business Insurance. I know there is two buckets one being Commercial Auto and then one being the GL portion, but you guys did increase your Commercial Auto PIKs two quarters ago in the fourth quarter. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense, the conservatism that you guys have now that this has been addressed and why -- maybe instead of half a point it's not one point that you chose to increase to your loss PIKs in the current quarter?","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah. Elyse our objective isn't missed at high or low. Our objective is always to get it right. We're trying to come up with an estimate of losses. We price the product based on an estimate of losses and an interest rate curve. And so our objective is always to get the right price. And so we weighed through a lot of data. We've got terrific actuaries and experts that help us think through this we've got management input on top of that. And our objective is to just get it right. So can we tell you, boy we swung a big stick at it and we're done this is it. No, we can't. But we can tell you that based on everything we see in the data. And based on our experience we think we got the PIKs in the right place.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bijan Moazami with Compass Point Research. Your line is open.","Bijan Moazami","Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I guess I want to understand a little bit more what's going on in the Commercial Auto business. In particular, you guys picked up a fair amount of premium volume this year and last year was it all great or was it something else?","And this big pick up in BI severity is that broad-based? Or is it related to a subsection of the Commercial Auto or is it geographically located?","Greg Toczydlowski","Hi. This is Greg. Yes, Commercial Auto as you can see in the quarter, we had an 8% change in net written premium. The predominant dynamic underneath that is broad RPC across the portfolio.","We're clearly seeing the Commercial Auto challenges that we believe the industry is also. So it really isn't a segment of the book. It's a broad dynamic and hence the reason why we've been achieving RPC, so broadly across it.","Bijan Moazami","Thank you. And then, regarding your $60 million reserve chart for environmental liability, I assume this is all pre-1986 and what's going on there?","Daniel Frey","Hey It's Dan. I am not sure that it goes all back as far as pre-1986. It certainly in the year -- action years older than 2009, it's really a continuation of what we have seen in environmental over the last several years.","We do see an improving environment in terms of the number of claims that come in. Because it is old, we do expect it's a runoff. The reaction here in this quarter is simply that things have not improved quite to the degree that we would have anticipated in our prior PIK.","So you're right to think about this as mostly very old stuff. You're right to think about it as generally improving over time in terms of the volume of these things slowing down it just hasn't slowed quite to the degree that we had previously expected.","Bijan Moazami","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Ryan Tunis","Hey thanks. Good morning. My first question I guess is just on the renewal rate number sequentially. And I'm trying to get a feel for maybe how much of that increase just had to do with the mix of the premium that you wrote in the second quarter versus the first.","Because I noticed that there was less workers' comp or you're obviously not getting rate but there is a lot more property, where I'm guessing the rate is better in the 3.6%.","So is there anyway to kind of tease out the impact of just control for mix in that 3.6% versus the -- or the 130 basis point increase sequentially?","Greg Toczydlowski","Yeah. Ryan, this is Greg again. Comp wasn't off materially. And obviously every month we pride ourselves in our pricing to the local execution very granular partnership with our distributions.","So it depends on the accounts that are coming up, the loss experience that's associated with them. And we do our best in partnering with them, but can't really say that there was a comp dynamic drive and that it was really the exposures that came up for renewal.","Ryan Tunis","And the exposure increase in workers' comp is it fair to kind of use the exposure increase for all of BI as a good barometer of what you're seeing in comp too?","Alan Schnitzer","No. Not necessarily. And we don't disclose comp at that level, but not necessarily. But Ryan, I'm looking here for the data. My instinct is that there's not a big mix factor driving the overall rate change.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. That's helpful. And then Alan was my follow-up was particularly on interest rates. First, I'm curious what the new money yield is today for the company? And then second of all, just thinking about buybacks versus where the stocks trading, like I haven't seen it trade at this price-to-book valuation in quite some time.","And I know, Alan you've always talked about structural returns in this business being linked to a certain extent to wherever interest rates are. And I guess we're back to very low levels of interest rates. So I'm curious looking into the back half of the year has your appetite for buybacks changed at all?","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah. Ryan, let me start with the buyback. And then I'll see if Bill wants to comment on the new money yields. But in terms of buybacks, our first objective for every dollar of capital that we generate is to invest it back in the business when we think we can do that and generate a return for it.","And when we can, we're going to give it back to investors. And our alternative is to put that fixed income bond portfolio. And we don't think that's what our investors expect us to do. As between dividends and buybacks, we think, by and large buybacks is the preferred solution it's less diluted to book value per share.","And so we're not trading in the stock. We're rightsizing capital. And we'll continue to do that. Of course we wouldn't be buying back stock. We thought the stock was trading at above intrinsic value and we don't.","So, this really is -- it's not tactical. We're rightsizing capital. And it's a strategy to deliver shareholder value. And over the last 10 or 12 years we get this question from time-to-time when depending on where the stock is trading.","And so this has come as a concern before or at least as a question before maybe not a concern. And I would just point out, since '06 we bought back something like $35 million worth of stock and at an average price per share of I think $66 or $67 a share. So we feel pretty good that we've bought the stock back thoughtfully in a way that's create -- created shareholder value and no change in our philosophy. Bill, do you want to comment on new money?","Bill Heyman","Yeah. Ryan in terms of new money yields, in the second quarter the new money yield was between 3% and 3.25%. It ended the quarter what was the bottom of that range and it's probably about there now. We think more in terms of the relationship between new money yields and mature yields. And obviously, in the fourth quarter of last year we were reinvesting at book yields comfortably above money running off. We were above in this first quarter, but less so, but obviously in the second quarter we slipped below and rates were at the lowest point in that cycle.","To measure the gap and on a daily basis, it's random, so we do it over periods. We look at the curve and spreads. We look at what is running off. We look at the mix of assets we're buying, which also changes. And we also look at sales we're making in the market, and we do make some sales, especially in areas where the tax reform act changed the profitability to us of certain products. I can tell you that the gap as we measure it is in excess of 50 basis points and can run higher than that.","Alan Schnitzer","And Ryan the net effect of everything built this year was in the outlook for NII that Dan shared in his prepared remarks and that's in the outlook section of the 10-Q. So that would all be reflected in that number.","Ryan Tunis","Thank you.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields","Pardon me, good morning. So quick question I guess on the workers' compensation reserve release. It's on a perfect comparison, but Schedule P showed $625 million-or-so of releases in full year 2018 for workers' compensation. So it seems like the pace is picking up and I was wondering is that because of more conservative PIKs or incrementally better observed loss trends?","Dan Frey","Hi. It's Dan. I wouldn't say more conservative loss PIKs. I would say, we're simply doing what we always do which is every quarter we're going to go through all the data as it comes in relative to the expectations that we had in the previous set of PIKs. Clearly, we've moved over time favorably in prior year reserve development in workers' comp.","We do take those things and reflect them in our most recent views. What you see this quarter is simply another quarter's worth of data where things have come in more favorably than what we would have embedded in the prior PIK. I don't think this is in anyway the unwinding of some increase in conservatism in prior PIKs.","Meyer Shields","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then I guess this is for Michael. When we -- if we take out the Personal Auto and Agency Homeowners from total personal lines, it seems like the remainder, the direct-to-consumer and international actually saw about 200 basis point in the quarter loss ratio on a year-over-year basis, excluding catastrophes and reserve development. Is that mix? Is that international?","Michael Klein","So we obviously disclosed the segment, we disclosed the components and you're talking about the delta. I would say, -- and we sort of talked about this in past quarters, the Canada -- the international book, which is predominantly Ontario auto, but broadly Canada has been underperforming. We're being impacted there by similar trends and experience that you've heard others in the industry talk about. We've got a game plan to work to improve that, but it's a challenging environment.","I will say on a positive note, we've got the seven point rate increase approved by Ontario earlier this year. We have another rate increase on file with the regulators as we speak. And through that and some distribution management and underwriting actions, we're working to improve the performance there. But yeah, the delta there is really a drag primarily from international.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Excellent. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you. Good morning. Going to the rate improvement in Business Insurance, so I think you said that it's currently in excess of loss trends on a written basis. Considering the fact that loss trends have moved up over the last couple of quarters at least, I guess, what quarter was the inflection point in terms of achieving rate in excess of trends?","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah. Yaron, that's a hard one to pick here on the fly. We're talking about going back and looking at it. We've said for a few quarters that they were close one way or the other, a couple of quarters ago when we said, written was a little bit ahead of trend. It was -- now based on our new view, it's probably a little bit behind trend. Exactly what quarter-to-date the inflection point is hard to pick. There is a lot of estimation in all of it.","We can tell you that as you heard Greg say in his prepared remarks, where we are today and it's not just rate, it's rate and exposure. Where we are today even taking into account our updated view of loss trend we feel like on a return basis, we're expanding margins.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. That's helpful. And then, if we turn to homeowners, so the deterioration in the loss ratio comes in the face of strong net premiums written growth and the quantum to product and in-home. Is the quantum product and is the growth strategy performing as expected? And is it just a matter of severe non-cat weather that's kind of thrown a wrinkle this quarter or -- I want to stop there.","Michael Klein","Sure, and this is Michael. I would say the short answer to your question is yes, the Quantum Home 2.0 product is performing as expected as we monitor the loss experience there and in particular the data that's most credible still at this early stages is frequency, but the loss experience is performing as we expected in the product. And in this quarter really the miss on underlying is actually more than explained by the non-cat weather variance.","I will take a step back and just talk to you sort of more broadly about homeowners profitability and just remind everybody that we have been talking about a bit of pressure on underlying loss experience in property some of that weather-related, some of that non-weather water-related. And while non-weather water wasn't a significant impact this quarter, it doesn't mean it's gone away. And so that's behind my comments about continuing to drive for price change in homeowners in order to address some of those underlying profitability challenges. But again, we think it's really weather-related and a little bit of non-weather water-related less about the product itself.","Yaron Kinar","Got it. Thank you very much.","Michael Klein","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning. Maybe two quick follow-ups on the total climate. The first question I have is what should give us confidence that I guess adverse trend line will not spread across other segments. Is it more so the inherent I guess nature of Commercial Auto which leaves it open to the plaintiffs' bar chasing it? Or what else is going on, on a bit more deeper basis?","Alan Schnitzer","Amit, I think we have said in prior quarters that we do see this thematically across liability lines. So whether it's bodily injury severity in personal auto or whether it's the CMP product or -- we have said we see it broadly. But we've also said that this is driven by a Commercial Auto underlying dynamic and the reason -- and I think we went into this a little bit in the fourth quarter, but the reason is there's a high degree of homogeneity to those losses.","And so in terms of the plaintiffs' bars business model, there is just a lot of attractiveness to that as compared to other claims. Slip and fall for example, where it's going to be highly dependent or -- anyway more dependent on facts and circumstances and it's a little bit more complicated to litigate. But again, as we've said in the past, we do see this thematically and we are taking that into account in all of our loss PIKs. Just so far, it's been for the most part a Commercial Auto dynamic.","Amit Kumar","Got it. The second question and my only question is, if you look at the pass trend lines and I think all of us have lived through adverse total climate, is your margin guidance -- is the thought process that it stabilizes here or are we at an inflection point? Or what should give us confidence that this does not deteriorate or continue to deteriorate further and then sort of swing back? I mean, how do we think about the inflection point here on this slide? Thanks.","Alan Schnitzer","Amit, Greg did say in his prepared remarks that we did increase our loss PIKs for BI as a consequence of what we're hearing. So we are -- we think that the starting point was higher and the inflation rate from here is higher. As I said in my answer to a prior question, do we think we've taken care of all of this? We think so otherwise we would have done something different. Having said that, we're not trying to be aggressive or conservative. We're trying to get it right. Our loss estimates or yield losses go into our pricing. And so it's important that we sharpen the pencil and put our very best estimate on it and that's what we've done.","And I think you can look back over some number of years in our business and our track record and whether it's in Commercial Auto or whether it's in Personal Auto or other issues, this is insurance loss estimates and underlying loss, I'm sure are going to change. And all you can hope is that you've got the right data, the right analytics, the right experience and the right expertise to see it and react to it. And we think if you look back over time in our business, we've done a pretty good job of reacting to that. And this -- it's unfortunate when it happens, but that's the business we're in and we think that we've done all the right things.","Amit Kumar","I got the answer I was looking for. Thank you so much and good luck for the future.","Alan Schnitzer","Thanks, Amit.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.","Brian Meredith","Yes. Thanks, Alan. I'm just curious here. Looking at the middle market, new business down year-over-year, little bit of deterioration to retentions, are you guys starting to dig in your heels a little bit more right now just on pricing in terms and conditions? Maybe kind of like we start to see happen back in 2011. Greg, it doesn't seems like an extreme situation. But is that -- should we expect kind of new business to continue to kind of be more challenging here going forward maybe retention start to deteriorate a little bit?","Greg Toczydlowski","Hey Brian, this is Greg. First, when you do that math, you're looking down from a really strong period in the prior year and we've shared with you in the past all those strategic initiatives we've been executing in the business really to free up our underwriters and give them more capacity to be active in the marketplace. The word active, we'll use based on different environments in the business.","Right now, active is really addressing what you said making sure that we do have the right terms and conditions and most importantly, the right adequate price on the product. And so, our underwriters have been using a lot of that capacity right now to improve the margins on the business and we think in terms of the book of business and your question on retention, we think it's a really high-quality book of business. And we do everything possible to work with our distributors to try to keep those retention levels up there while improving the margins on the business also.","Alan Schnitzer","I would like to point out 2011 was a very different environment in terms of where we were in terms of rate adequacy and returns. So, it's difficult to draw a comparison. Every point in the cycle is different and I'm not sure there's a lot of comparison.","Brian Meredith","Got you, got you. And then, second question just quickly here. I know you guys are in Q2, but you do have an excess surplus line through a non-admitted carrier. Can you give us any differentiation between those two markets as far as what you're seeing happening in non-admitted versus admitted? What you're seeing...","Greg Toczydlowski","Yes Brian, this is Greg again. Sure. We see some of the industry statistics also where there has been an uptick in some of the larger states from a non-admitted point of view. Just as a reminder, we have two areas where we write non-admitted business. One in our north field business which is a less complex solution, a smaller business exposure you can think of it that way. And then we also use the non-admitted business across our property book of business. But as you said, certainly not a real big part of our product strategy. And that's because, we think, we've got really modular and customized product offerings and what we need to do to address terms and conditions in this market, our product portfolio has been able to do that. So, we've been comfortable with that portfolio mix.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We have completed the allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Abbe Goldstein for closing remarks.","Abbe Goldstein","Thanks everyone for joining us this morning.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported fourth quarter core income of $633 million, generating a core return on equity of a little over 11%. That brings our full-year core income to $2.43 billion and full-year core return on equity to 9%. The fact that we were able to generate that level of profit and profitability given the extraordinary catastrophe losses for the industry this quarter and year on top of a decade of historically low interest rates and several years of a relatively soft pricing environment speaks to the earnings power of the franchise. It\u2019s the value of our competitive advantages, starting with underwriting excellence and investment expertise.","For the year, catastrophe losses were manageable and we generated an after-tax underlying underwriting gain in excess of $1.2 billion and after-tax net investment income of nearly $1.9 billion. Our results and strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 4% during the year after returning $2.2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders. As I\u2019ll share in a minute, we\u2019re encouraged about the outlook for 2018.","Overall, we were pleased with our underlying combined ratio of 92.6% for the year, which was impacted by high levels of non-cat weather and non-cat fire-related losses relative to our expectations. Underneath that, our commercial businesses continue to perform well. For the year, business insurance delivered a strong underlying combined ratio of 94.9%. Bond and specialty insurance delivered an impressive underlying combined ratio of 83.2% even after a charge in the fourth quarter for a single surety loss outside the United States. In personal insurance, we were pleased with an underlying combined ratio in the quarter of 90.4%, bringing the full year to 91.5%. Those results reflect continued success in our leading property business, loss trends in personal auto within expectations, and the continued successful execution of the pricing and underwriting actions we\u2019ve been taking in the auto business all year.","Notably, our consolidated expense ratio was down 80 basis points for the year as we grew earned premium by almost 5%, continued to invest in the strategic initiatives we discussed with you at our recent investor day, and delivered on our objective of improving productivity and efficiency, which resulted in about flat G&A expense dollars. ","Turning to the top line, we were very pleased with the success of our marketplace execution which resulted in full-year net written premium growth of 5% to a record $26.2 billion. Importantly, in domestic business insurance in the quarter, renewal rate change reached 1.4 points, doubling from the third quarter, and renewal premium change reached 4 points. For both measures, that\u2019s the highest levels in about three years. Brian will give you more texture on the execution underneath the headlines, including a view by line, but I\u2019ll note that we achieved renewal rate gains in the quarter more broadly across our product portfolio and our accounts compared to recent periods. It\u2019s an acceleration of a trend in improved pricing we\u2019ve achieved over the past six quarters as the market started reacting to two things: first, the hurricanes and wildfires in the back half of the year; and second and more significant in my view, declining margins generally as interest rates remain at historically low levels and loss trend has outpaced rate and exposure for a few years now.","As we\u2019ve doing all year and as I reiterated last quarter, we\u2019ll continue to seek rate thoughtfully and in close coordination with our agent and broker partners with the belief that our customers are well served by a stable and predictable market that keeps pace with inflation as opposed to more dramatic price swings of the past. Given our sense of the market and the fact that retentions remain at historic highs, we\u2019re encouraged.","Aside from the pricing environment, new business in domestic business insurance was up in the quarter and for the year. We explained at our recent investor day that a number of the initiatives we have underway are designed to create more top line opportunities for us. It\u2019s still early days, but what we can see so far is positive. Our marketplace execution in both bond and specialty insurance and personal insurance was equally successful. ","In our management liability business, we maintained retention at an impressive 88% throughout the year with stable renewal premium change and higher new business volume. Surety premium was higher both in the quarter and for the year as a result of an increase in large bond activity. Personal insurance finished the year with another quarter of accomplishing our objectives of improving auto profitability while maintaining momentum in our leading homeowners business. We achieved 11 points of renewal premium change in auto, enough to offset the bodily injury severity we identified in the second half of 2016 on a written basis, and delivered policy in force growth throughout the year in our homeowners business. ","As it relates to the market generally, there has been a lot of speculation about how corporate tax reform will impact pricing. Stepping back, we price our products with return objectives in mind. The tax rate is just one factor impacting the pricing we need to achieve in order to reach our return objectives. Other factors, for example, include the adequacy of expiring prices, loss trends, expenses, the cost of reinsurance, the impact of claims initiatives and so on. Speaking for us, tax reform will help shrink the gap between where returns are trending and where we\u2019d like them to be trending, but it doesn\u2019t completely close the gap. Also, not every participant in the marketplace will benefit from tax reform, and even among those who do, the extent of the benefit varies. In short, for us tax reform helps, but we still have ground to cover.","As I said a minute ago, we\u2019re encouraged about the outlook for 2018. We\u2019re well positioned to benefit from continued improvement in the pricing environment, the opportunities afforded by a more level playing field for domestic insurers as a result of tax reform, and the prospect of a strengthening economy. With that wind at our backs and from a position of strength, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our competitive advantages, focusing on extending our lead in risk expertise, improving the experience for our customers, agents and brokers, and enhancing productivity and efficiency. We believe we\u2019re well positioned to continue to create shareholder value.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jay.","Jay Benet","Thanks Alan. Core income was $633 million, down from $919 million in the prior year quarter, while core ROE was 11.1%, down from 16.4%. As has been the case all year, these reductions in core income and core ROE were not driven by changes in our underlying performance. Our underlying performance remains strong and actually improved over the prior year quarter. Rather, these reductions were reflective of a continued high level of cat activity and the inclusion of an $82 million after-tax benefit in the prior year quarter from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute.","The strength of our underlying underwriting results is evidenced by our consolidated underlying combined ratio of 92.4%, similar to the 92% we produced in the prior year quarter. Cat losses were $324 million after tax compared to only $89 million in the prior year quarter. This $235 million increase was driven by losses from the California wildfires of $426 million after tax, comprising $382 million after tax for the October wildfires in northern California and $44 million after tax for the December wildfires in southern California, partially offset by current year net favorable development of $102 million after tax for catastrophes that occurred earlier this year, almost all of which related to the third quarter hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. ","For both Harvey and Irma, the benefits of our underwriting actions over many years, including management of overall exposure, limits and deductibles, resulted in more favorable claim outcomes than we had expected. For Maria, given that the storm occurred late in the third quarter and access to the impacted areas was extremely limited, our estimate was based on an exposure analysis. That initial estimate has come down due to our receiving fewer claims than we had expected. ","Net favorable prior year reserve development, for which I\u2019ll provide more details shortly, was $192 million after tax, up from $172 million in the prior year quarter. Net investment income of $467 million after-tax, while continuing to be strong, was down $26 million from the prior year quarter. Non-fixed income NII decreased by $19 million after tax due to lower private equity returns which, although strong, were not as strong as in the prior year quarter. Fixed income NII, as anticipated, was lower by $8 million after tax due to the continued low interest rate environment. Taking into account long-term bonds that are scheduled to mature in 2018, growth in the size of our fixed income portfolio, higher short-term interest rates and the new U.S. tax law, we expect that after-tax fixed income NII for 2018 will be $25 million to $30 million higher quarter over quarter as compared to corresponding quarters in 2017, a significant improvement from recent years.","Relative to what several other companies have disclosed, the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 had a relatively modest impact on our fourth quarter results, a $129 million charge recorded as part of net income. This charge resulted mostly from revaluing our net deferred tax asset as of the enactment date using the new 21% tax rate and, to a lesser extent, providing on the taxes on the deemed repatriation of our foreign earnings. I should also mention that we executed some tax-related actions in the fourth quarter that provided real economic benefits while having an insignificant impact on fourth quarter 2017 core and net income, but slightly increasing our fourth quarter consolidating combined ratio primarily through the expense ratio by about half a point. Under the new tax law, muni bond investment income will continue to be taxed at 5.25% while all other U.S.-based income will be taxed at 21% rather than 35%, so looking forward, you should update your models.","Consolidated net favorable prior year reserve development was $293 million pre-tax compared to $264 million in the prior year quarter. Business insurance\u2019s net favorable reserve development was $244 million pre-tax compared to $221 million in the prior year quarter primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in domestic workers comp and commercial multi-peril, partially offset by higher than expected loss experience in domestic commercial auto. Bond and specialty net favorable development was $42 million pre-tax compared to $79 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in domestic management liability, while personal insurance had net favorable development of $7 million pre-tax compared to $36 million of net unfavorable development in the prior year quarter.","For full year 2017, we had consolidated net favorable development of $592 million pre-tax. As in prior years, I\u2019m providing you with some insight into what our combined 2017 Schedule P is expected to show when filed on May 1. Excluding A&E, on a combined stat Schedule P basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate developed favorably, and except for commercial auto liability, which developed unfavorably by $87 million pre-tax due to higher than expected bodily injury claims in recent accident years, all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development. ","Page 19 of the webcast sets forth information about our January 1 cat treaty renewal. Our corporate cat aggregate XOL treaty continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and an accumulation of losses from multiple cat events with similar terms as in the prior year, but at a slightly higher cost. The treaty continues to provide $1.5 billion of coverage, part of $2 billion excess of $3 billion after a $100 million deductible per occurrence. It keeps the same broad peril and geographic coverage and the same positioning of the coverage layer, providing a significant buffer between earnings and capital. The treaty has a single limit with no reinstatement provisions, and note that the total cost of this treaty and therefore the slight cost increase are quite small in relation to our core income.","Fourth quarter operating cash flows, which were impacted by the relatively high level of cat claim payments, were $538 million, bringing total operating cash flow to over $3.7 billion for the year. We ended the year with holding company liquidity of almost $1.3 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were over $1.4 billion pre-tax or $1.1 billion after tax, up from $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion respectively at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $87.46 and adjusted book value per share of $83.36 increased 5% and 4% respectively from the beginning of the year. ","Consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy and despite the high level of cat losses, we were able to return $549 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter while maintaining our balance sheet strength through dividends of $198 million and share repurchases of $351 million, bringing total capital return to shareholders to over $2.2 billion in 2017.","With me, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.","Brian MacLean","Thanks Jay. Starting with this quarter\u2019s results in business insurance, segment income was strong at $637 million and the combined ratio for the quarter of 88.6% was flat to the prior year. Income was down from the prior year due primarily to the settlement of a reinsurance dispute in the fourth quarter of 2016. The underlying combined ratio for both the quarter and the full year was about a point higher than 2016. In both cases, the increase was driven by the loss ratio with loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing, while the full-year variance also reflects an unusually high number of large non-cat fire losses in 2017. The full-year expense ratio of 31.9% was half a point lower than the prior year. As Jay mentioned, the fourth quarter included the impact of some tax-related actions, so the full year is a better indication of our expense run rate.","Net written premiums of $3.4 billion for the quarter were up about 5% year-over-year with domestic net written premiums up about 4%, driven by continued strong production results in middle market. International net written premiums were up 15% or 11% excluding the impact of the change in foreign currency rates. The growth in international was driven by strong production results in Europe and Canada, along with some normal fluctuations in the Lloyd\u2019s volume.","Turning to domestic production, we were very pleased with our results in the quarter. Renewal rate change was 1.4% and renewal premium change was 4%, and as Alan said, for both the highest the level in about three years. Retention remained at a historically high level of 85% and new business was strong for the quarter at $478 million, up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2016. ","Looking at the individual businesses, in select, production remains strong with renewal premium change for the quarter of over 5%, retention of 83%, and new business premiums of $100 million up 11% year-over-year. In middle market, renewal rate change increased to 1.5%, up about a point year-over-year, and renewal premium change increased to 3.6%. Retention remained at a historically high level of 87% while new business premiums of $298 million were up 17% versus the prior year quarter.","In terms of new business, the technology, tools and process changes we\u2019ve been rolling out over the last several years that we discussed at our recent day have allowed us to be more active in our targeted industry segments. In select, we\u2019re generating more submissions and quotes and having success in closing those incremental opportunities. In middle markets, we\u2019ve been successful in quoting more while also closing more large accounts than a year ago. While the normal volatility in writing large accounts was a factor in this quarter\u2019s growth, we believe our initiatives are beginning to have an impact.","For the aggregate, production results were very strong, but as we have said many times, the aggregate numbers alone don\u2019t tell the entire story. The detail of where we are getting rate and what accounts we are retaining is key to evaluating the success of our execution, and looking at the results below the headline numbers we couldn\u2019t be more pleased. For example, as you would expect, there was significant line of business texture below the headline production numbers. ","In terms of pricing, workers compensation, a line that has had strong returns in recent periods, had renewal premium change that was positive but lower than a year ago. Conversely, commercial auto, which is a challenge from a return perspective line, had the highest positive price change in the quarter, well above loss trends. What\u2019s also encouraging to us is that across all the other major product lines - property, GL, C&P, and umbrella, renewal premium change was positive and up both year-over-year and sequentially. Importantly, we were able to achieve these pricing increases while maintaining strong retention and growing new business.","There was also significant texture based on individual account performance. We continue to be pleased that we are retaining our best performing business, as evidenced by retention rates in excess of 90% for our best performing middle market accounts. In addition, pricing in the quarter improved across the continuum of middle market book, most significantly in our poor performing accounts where we achieved rate increases well in excess of loss trends. Finally, in addition to what we\u2019re seeing in the numbers, we\u2019re also encouraged that there has been some tightening of terms and conditions for catastrophe-exposed risks. ","So all in, a great quarter and end to the year. We were very pleased with our execution in the marketplace and how we are positioned for continued success in 2018. ","Before turning to bond and specialty, and I want to comment on our outlook for operating margins, which we include in our quarterly filings. Since our 10-K won\u2019t be filed for a few weeks, I would note that we expect underlying underwriting margins in 2018 will be higher than in 2017, and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly lower than in 2017 assuming lower and more normalized levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses and other loss activity. This is subject to the usual caveats and forward-looking statement disclaimers.","In bond and specialty insurance, segment income for the quarter was $112 million, down from the prior year quarter due to the international surety charge that Alan mentioned as well as a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development. In surety, losses are episodic and we remain pleased with the quality of our book. The underlying combined ratio increased from the prior year quarter to 91.1%, reflecting the impact of the surety charge.","Net written premiums for the quarter were up 5%, reflecting growth in both our domestic surety and management liability businesses. Surety growth was driven by a higher level of large bond activity in the quarter.","Turning to production in our domestic management liability businesses, we continue to execute our strategy of growing our profitable portfolio by retaining our best performing accounts and writing new business in return adequate product segments, so we couldn\u2019t be more pleased that retention came in at a strong 88% for the quarter while new business was up 17% from the fourth quarter of last year. Renewal premium change of 3.4% was up slightly from the third quarter. Bond and specialty results were solid, and we continue to feel great about our market position.","In terms of outlook for 2018, we expect that underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined ratio for the first nine months of 2018 will be broadly consistent with the same period of 2017. In the last quarter of 2018, we expect that underlying underwriting margins will be higher and the underlying combined ratio will be lower than in the same period of 2017. ","Turning to personal insurance, net written premiums for the segment grew 8% in the quarter driven by higher pricing primarily in auto and modest PIF growth primarily in homeowners. Catastrophe losses in the quarter were approximately $200 million after tax, above both prior year and our normal expectations, resulting in a $50 million loss for the quarter and a combined ratio of 108.7%. For the full year despite pre-tax cat losses of more than $1 billion, personal insurance generated $128 million of income. The underlying combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 90.4% improved by 3.2 points compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter, and the full-year underlying combined ratio of 91.5% was about half a point higher than full-year 2016.","The domestic agency auto combined ratio for the quarter was 103%, including a 1.1 point benefit from catastrophe losses as we reduced our auto estimate related to Hurricane Harvey. The underlying combined ratio of 104.1% improved by 8.1 points from the prior year. As you can see on Page 15 of the webcast, 4.7 points of the decrease is due to last year\u2019s fourth quarter having been elevated as a result of the year-to-date impact of the bodily injury loss re-estimation. The remainder of the improvement is primarily as a result of earned rate from filing actions we have taken over the past year now exceeding loss trends by several points, in line with the planned actions we outlined a year ago. I would remind you that seasonality inflates the absolute value of the fourth quarter combined ratio. ","As we have continued to take actions to improve profitability in the auto book, renewal premium change increased to 10.6% in the fourth quarter. Retention declined modestly, as expected, given the pricing actions, and PIF growth has leveled out, again in line with our plans. We were pleased with the level of written rate in 2017 and looking ahead, we expect that full-year RPC for 2018 will be broadly consistent with the full-year 2017 result as we look to continue to improve the profitability of the book.","Turning to agency, homeowners and other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 115.3% included over 45 points from cat losses, driven by the wildfires in California. The underlying combined ratio of 70.2% for the quarter was consistent with the prior year quarter as higher non-cat weather losses were basically offset by an improvement in the expense ratio. For the full year, the abnormally high cat result of 23.6 points drove the combined ratio up to 100.7%, while the underlying combined ratio of 77.1% was about a point and a half above the prior year due primarily to higher non-cat weather losses.","Homeowners volume continued to exhibit momentum with healthy PIF growth throughout the year to finish up 5.5% compared to the prior year-end. We\u2019re pleased that our focus on generating growth in this product line has enabled us to steadily increase property PIF count even as we have intentionally slowed the PIF growth in auto. We\u2019re also pleased to have introduced our newest property product, Quantum Home 2.0, in three pilot states during the fourth quarter with initial response from agents and customers in line with our expectations. ","Overall in personal insurance, while the headlines were all about the significant catastrophe losses, we feel great about having achieved the goals we had established entering 2017. In addition, we continued our ongoing expense discipline, which resulted in slightly lower G&A expenses while delivering 9% growth in net written premiums for the segment, reducing the full year expense ratio by 1.5 points. So for personal insurance in 2017, we were very pleased with the execution on the key elements needed to position this segment for success in 2018.","Finally as it relates to our outlook for the personal insurance segment as a whole, we expect underlying underwriting margins in 2018 will be higher than in 2017, and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly lower than in 2017. ","Stepping back to the enterprise, we generated over $2 billion in profits in a year that was dominated by the impact of weather and large losses, so we feel good about the result but, more importantly, feel great about the execution across all our businesses and our market position entering 2018.","With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Before we go to the Q&A portion, Alan has a few additional words.","Alan Schnitzer","Thanks Gabby. As bittersweet as it is, we have one last piece of business before we open it up for questions. I just want to acknowledge and thank Brian MacLean, who will be retiring at the end of March after a spectacular 30-year career and, after today, something like 53 consecutive earnings calls. He\u2019d never take credit for it, but we owe so much of what we\u2019ve accomplished over so many years to him. He\u2019s been a great colleague to so many and he\u2019s been an important partner and friend to me. Thank you, Brian.","With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Kai Pan","Thank you, good morning. First, congratulations to Brian for three decades at Travelers and best wishes for your retirement. That doesn\u2019t count as a question, so my first question is on pricing. So there is a saturation of BI pricing, and you mentioned that your outlook for 2018 the BIs lower underlying combined ratio, but the 1.4% increase is still lower than the general loss cost trend of 3 to 4%. Just wondering what\u2019s behind the scenes that you expect the pricing to accelerate.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes Kai, good morning, it\u2019s Alan. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s all the things that we talked to you about quarter over quarter in terms of our ability to pull levers and manage profitability, and I\u2019ll remind you that exposure is a piece of that, and that significant portion of exposure contributes to it, but so does selection and mix and the way we segment and the way we price the product claims handling, risk control, expense management. All of those things contribute to our outlook on profitability in the underlying combined ratio.","Kai Pan","Okay, then my follow-up is on the tax rate. What\u2019s your overall effective tax rate for the corporation in 2018, and Alan, from your comments it looks like most of the tax benefit will flow through to the bottom line.","Jay Benet","This is Jay Benet. The reason I gave you the pieces is that the effective tax rate is always going to be a function of the relationship of the tax-exempt interest to the total interest, so in whatever modeling you\u2019re doing, you need to come up with what you believe the tax exempt interest is going to be, apply a 5.25 tax rate to that, and then everything else that\u2019s U.S. domestic will be at the 21% rate. So the effective tax rate is going to move, but again that\u2019s the way of calculating it.","Alan Schnitzer","Kai, just reflecting back on your other question, you were talking about the pricing outlook, and I would just remind you that, as Brian shared with you, that assumes that in BI, the non-cat weather and elevated fire losses, and for that matter in PI, the non-cat weather will both return to normal levels by historical standards. Obviously weather and large losses are going to be what they\u2019re going to be, but the outlook reflects that as well.","In terms of the benefit from tax reform and what\u2019s going to happen to it, we--as I tried to express in my prepared remarks, it goes into the mix of everything else that we use to generate the prices we need, so yes, I do think that it will fall to the bottom line.","Kai Pan","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Ryan Tunis","Thanks. Just for Alan, and a follow-up to Kai\u2019s question, just thinking about the fact that last quarter we had a 2018 outlook for broadly consistent margins, and now three months later the outlook is they\u2019ll improve, just wanted to drill down a little further on what it is you\u2019ve seen over the last three months, because I think your outlook on pricing then was also pretty positive. But I guess over the last three months, what\u2019s given you more confidence to really think that margins will be better?","Alan Schnitzer","You\u2019ve got to remember that when we talk about underwriting margins, we\u2019re talking about dollars, and combined ratio we\u2019re talking about combined ratio points. That\u2019s a function of the written volume, for example, and everything else that goes into the mix, so it\u2019s a combination of all the things that impact margins and combined ratio. I\u2019m not sure how else to express that.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. I guess just on auto, then, I think what you said is you think that RPC will be a similar level to this year as it was last year, and it seemed like this year, it was several points above loss trend. If you could just talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing there, because that sounds like a decent amount of rain. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a severity uptick beyond what you expected, or something along those lines. Thanks.","Michael Klein","Hey Ryan, it\u2019s Michael Klein. Thanks for the question. The short answer is no, it doesn\u2019t reflect anything beyond what we expected. It\u2019s just the follow-on steps in our existing game plan, and I think when you think about pricing, think of it in three pieces, so the written rate we\u2019re going to achieve in 2018 is partly based on the rate we have already filed in addition to the rate we\u2019ll file in \u201918, and so that drives a lot of our rate outlook. What I think you\u2019ll see as you look ahead to 2018 is RPC in the first half of the year will be higher than the numbers you see on the page from the first half of 2017, and the back half of the year will be lower than the numbers you see for the back half of \u201917. Importantly, on an earned basis since written rate has accelerated through \u201917, earned rate will actually rise in 2018 relative to 2017, so that\u2019s sort of the way that we think about it. But no, the broadly consistent RPC outlook doesn\u2019t reflect anything unanticipated in our loss experience.","Ryan Tunis","That\u2019s helpful, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning. Maybe just staying on personal auto with Michael Klein, you gave some good color on RPC. How should we think about the PIF growth from here, just based on the fact that a majority of your book is 12 months? When should we see some change in that number down the road?","Michael Klein","Thanks Amit, appreciate the question. I think if you think about just the broad themes on auto, what we talked about in 2017, our objective was to improve profitability and manage growth, manage meaning being reduced. As we think about our objective for \u201918, it\u2019s really to try to achieve more balance between growth and profitability in auto, and I think you can certainly see as we talked about last quarter, we felt like we turned the corner on auto profitability in the third quarter. You\u2019re seeing in the year-on-year adjusted underlying combined comparison that improvement accelerating, but again consistent with our RPC outlook, still work to do there. So again, we\u2019re looking to achieve a balance between profitability and growth in \u201918, and then as that profitability continues to improve, we\u2019ll look to resume growth. But right now, we\u2019re trying to level off and then move it forward.","Amit Kumar","Thanks, that\u2019s actually helpful. My follow-up, switching back to commercial lines, I know there was some good texture on the pricing change. I\u2019m curious, if we were to step back and think about the active cat quarter for Q3 and Q4 and its impact on the marketplace, would you say that it\u2019s early days for, I guess, a broad-based firming of the small and middle commercial market, or is it more isolated near term?","Alan Schnitzer","Amit, it\u2019s Alan. You know, we tried to give you a perspective by line to really address that because putting workers\u2019 comp aside, and that is its own story, the price increases we were able to achieve in the quarter were broader than just the properly lines. As I shared in my prepared remarks, I think the more significant factor driving the pricing is where margins were, certainly for us, and that\u2019s probably true relative to the industry. So you know, I can\u2019t tell you exactly what the industry is going to do or what\u2019s going to happen, but I can tell you what we\u2019re going to do, and that\u2019s to thoughtfully and in close coordination with our agent and broker partners continue to push for rate where we need it to improve the outlook and trend of returns.","Amit Kumar","Okay, I\u2019ll stop here. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. ","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, thank you. Good morning. My first question, in terms of the margin outlook for business insurance for next year, can you quantify the impact that non-cat weather had this year so we know what to adjust for when thinking about \u201918? In your margin outlook, how are you thinking about the expense ratio versus the loss ratio as we think about you potentially earning in better rate next year?","Greg Toczydlowski","Hey Elyse, this is Greg Toczydlowski from Business Insurance. In terms of your first question, think about a point in terms of where large losses and non-cat weather are relative to our longer term expectations for 2017, and that would be a good way to think about a going forward perspective. ","Alan Schnitzer","Elyse, on your question about expenses, we\u2019re going to try to resist the temptation to break out the go-forward perspective on the loss ratio versus the expense ratio. We give you an outlook on the combined ratio, at least qualitatively, because you get into some judgements and a level of precision that is probably further than we\u2019d like to go, at least from an outlook perspective.","Jay Benet did say in his opening remarks, or maybe it was Brian, that looking at the full year was probably a better perspective on the outlook, and I will add, just following up on our comments at our recent investor day, that productivity and efficiency are important strategic initiatives for us. We\u2019ve seen that benefit of that this year. We\u2019ve got real productivity and efficiency enhancements on the shop floor right now, and we think there\u2019s more to come, and what that does for us, it\u2019s not necessarily that we\u2019re trying to dial in a much lower expense ratio. What we\u2019re trying to do is create all the benefits that come from operating leverage, so we can take those incremental dollars and, as I\u2019ve said before, we can let them fall to the bottom line, we can use it to invest in important strategic capabilities, or we can put it into pricing, and it really is that flexibility that we\u2019re looking for going forward.","But in terms of the outlook, we\u2019re going to stick with the broader commentary on overall margins.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. My second question, in terms of the pricing environment, going back to business insurance again, you said in your opening remarks that you want rates to keep pace with inflation. What are you pegging inflation at right now within your commercial lines book, and when you make that comment, I guess that\u2019s what we should compare when we think about the RPC going forward within business insurance? ","Alan Schnitzer","Yes Elyse, we\u2019ve said for a long time that our long-term outlook, and again that\u2019s long-term perspective for all of business insurance, is about 4%, and really no change on that. There\u2019s some texture underneath by line, for example. I\u2019m not sure what your question was about RPC, but rate contributes to margin, and there\u2019s a portion of exposure that\u2019s obviously part of RPC that also contributes to it, so I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the texture and color you were looking for.","Elyse Greenspan","I guess what I was thinking about was your RPC was about 4% in the quarter, and then you were saying that inflation was about 4%, but then to your commentary it seems like you are pushing for more price across your book of business from where we were at in the fourth quarter, so I was just trying to tie those two comments together. ","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, so Elyse, I would say think of RPC as having two components - one, pure rate, and two, exposure. Of the piece that\u2019s exposure, a portion of that behaves like margin and there\u2019s a portion of it that has real loss content in it and doesn\u2019t. So you know, RPC needs to be above the overall loss trend in order for us to consider margins to be expanding, and you could look at those numbers and you\u2019d say, at least on a written basis, we\u2019re getting close. Although, we do think--I do think over time that insurance like most other businesses, pricing ought to keep up with inflation, but I would say that given where we are now and in terms of the outlook and trend for returns, we\u2019re looking to do a little bit better than just offset inflation, were looking to expand margin.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is with regards to the rate increases in business insurance. If I strip out commercial auto, I think if my calculation is correct, I get to roughly flat rate for the rest of the business. Am I thinking about that correctly, or are there maybe areas or lines where you are getting more rates outside of commercial auto?","Jay Benet","Yes Yaron, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing the math entirely correctly. There\u2019s a lot of different pieces underneath the net written premium change, which I think you\u2019re trying to back into, so we\u2019re certainly, as Alan said earlier, very much focused on where some of the more distressed lines are - automobile and the catastrophic exposed areas of property, but we\u2019re also pushing ahead on all the products, so the math doesn\u2019t come out where we\u2019re flat on all the other product lines.","Alan Schnitzer","I would just direct you back to Brian\u2019s comments where he gave you a view of pricing by line, so price is positive in every line outside of workers\u2019 comp, higher both sequentially and year-over-year. We can follow up with you and walk you through the math if that\u2019s helpful.","Yaron Kinar","Yes, we\u2019ll do that. Then one other question on tax reform. Alan, if I understand your comments correct, basically you\u2019re looking at the results of--you\u2019re targeting a certain return, and tax reform ends up helping that return. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of are you expecting any change in investment allocation that would further boost or decrease the impact of tax reform?","Alan Schnitzer","Let me turn that over to Bill Heyman and ask him to respond to that.","Bill Heyman","I think it was possible there will be over time some reallocation. The elimination of corporate AMT removed a ceiling in terms of the amount of municipals we can own, although that\u2019s very theoretical. Every day we look at what the market throws up in terms of assuming roughly equal credit quality, which is rarely the case, where is the highest after-tax return. I think going forward, that will more often in certain segments of the curve be in taxables rather than municipals. It may even be that we buy taxables and sell municipals in certain parts of the curve, and the reason for that is for the first time I can remember, individual investors and corporate investors have very different utility functions, so at many parts of the curve your municipal is not worth as much to us as it used to be, but it\u2019s worth more to an individual investor than it is to us. So there may be opportunities to pick up after-tax yield on advantageous terms, but obviously we can\u2019t guarantee them or quantify them. But I suspect if you looked at the portfolio three years now, the mix would have changed.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. ","Paul Newsome ","I wanted to ask whether or not the outlook for M&A for Travelers has changed with tax reform. Does it make it easier or more interesting to buy something outside the U.S. for Travelers?","Alan Schnitzer","Good morning, Paul. What I can tell you is that tax reform for us and others who are similarly situated obviously just makes us a more competitive buyer relative to a non-U.S. taxpayer who previously had the benefit of some structural advantages, structural tax advantages. Those advantages have gone away, so that levels the playing field, so relatively speaking we\u2019re a more competitive buyer, so that\u2019s changed for sure.","What hasn\u2019t changed, Paul, is either our lens or our propensity to do transactions, and by that I mean we are always looking for opportunities, both organic and inorganic, and when we can make them happen on terms that are attractive to us, we\u2019re going to try hard to do that. As I\u2019ve said before and just to reiterate it, we\u2019re going to try to do deals when it improves our return profile, lowers our volatility, or provides us with other important strategic benefits, so maybe our positioning relative to others changes but our lens or propensity doesn\u2019t.","The other thing that won\u2019t change is our capital management strategy. We will continue to think about and allocate capital the same way we have historically. I guess given tax reform and all other things being equal, there\u2019s probably higher earnings and capital to put to through that capital management filter, but our thought process around capital management doesn\u2019t change.","Paul Newsome","That\u2019s it for me, thanks. Congrats on the quarter.","Alan Schnitzer","Thanks Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. My first question is on capital deployment in 2018. Should we still consider 100% of operating earnings as being deployable for share buybacks and dividends, absent another opportunity emerging?","Jay Benet","Hi Jay, it\u2019s Jay. As Alan just said, the way we think about capital management hasn\u2019t changed, so we\u2019re always going to try to fund growth, we\u2019re always going to look for opportunities to create shareholder value, and to the extent that we continue to create excess capital, we\u2019ll manage it the same way - returning it to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and the driver of that is the earnings of the play. So no change there, and what we\u2019ve said in the 10-K and the 10-Q all along with regard to that still holds.","Jay Gelb","I appreciate that. Then if I can try one on tax, using your supplement, if I look at the tax-free municipal income and apply the rate you mentioned, I guess I get kind of driven down to a 15.5 to 16% overall effective tax rate. Am I in the neighborhood on that? ","Jay Benet","If the calculation you\u2019re doing is looking at the supplement, taking some view as to what the average asset base would be for the munis, applying the rate that we show in the supplement as the earnings rate on that, you\u2019ll get the pre-tax muni NII, apply 5.25% to that, and you\u2019ll have that component of the tax accrual, and then the rest, whatever you\u2019re assuming with regard to the non-muni income, not just NII but underwriting, apply the 21% to and you\u2019ll get an effective tax rate.","Jay Gelb","Okay, thanks Jay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next call is a question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Jay Cohen","Thank you - back-to-back Jays. A couple of questions. First is the surety premiums went up. You said there was more activity. Do you see this being a function of the economy, and should we expect the top line on the surety side to possibly expand, especially if we\u2019ve got more infrastructure spending?","Tom Kunkel","Jay, this is Tom Kunkel, good morning. I think the way we\u2019re looking at the surety production in the month is it really can be episodic, and those are some very well performing businesses and accounts that we were doing that volume with but I wouldn\u2019t say that we in any way view it as indicative as an increase in activity for the type of work that drives surety bonding. So as they say, a little lumpy.","Jay Cohen","Got it. Other question, on the commercial lines market, your effort to raise prices a bit more aggressively has been met with a retention that has stayed at a historically high level. It suggests the rest of the market is coming along as well, and I\u2019m wondering if you could speak qualitatively about what you\u2019re hearing from agents and brokers regarding how your competitors are responding to the same pressures that you are.","Alan Schnitzer","Jay, it\u2019s Alan. We don\u2019t talk a lot to our distribution partners about the way our competitors price. It\u2019s a competitive marketplace, and they do what they do and we do what we do. I will tell you that just in terms of our process, we do a lot of work and we\u2019ve got a lot of talent out there in the field, and our underwriters are out talking to our distribution partners about accounts 90, 120 days out to make sure that we\u2019re working in partnership with them and making sure that we\u2019re sharing with our customers why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing. So you know, we\u2019ve got, I think just a tremendous field organization and I think they\u2019ve done a great job.","Obviously we do operate in a competitive marketplace, and so I do think that what you see in our results is to some degree a reflection of the market. I\u2019ve always thought that there are probably two reasons that maybe we have a little bit of incremental pricing power. One is just the franchise value we bring to the marketplace in product breadth and risk control and claims--an unbelievable claims organization, and I think that our agent and broker partners are proud to sell that and I think our customers see value in it. ","The other advantage I think we have to some degree is data analytics. It\u2019s about risk selection and pricing, and we\u2019ve been a pioneer for a long time in not just data analytics but delivering that data and analytics to the screen of the local underwriter at the point of sale. So I do think those two things probably give us a little bit of an advantage, but certainly there is a marketplace dynamic to what we\u2019re able to achieve.","Jay Cohen","Got it, thanks Alan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please proceed.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. Two quick questions here for you. The first one, I\u2019m just curious, could we parse a little bit business insurance as far as what\u2019s going on from a rate perspective? I\u2019m just curious, when small commercial, not a lot of rate, it just doesn\u2019t need it, more competitive pressures, and also on your large ticket property business, that\u2019s one that you had excluded a while from your rate calculations because it\u2019s so competitive, how is that trending now and maybe relative to your expectations? And then I have one follow-up.","Greg Toczydlowski","Brian, this is Greg. I\u2019ll start with the small commercial one. We\u2019ve been focusing on the small commercial business for a number of years now, really trying to get the margins to a place where we feel very comfortable with them, and we are very much within our target thresholds of where we want to be from a small commercial, so we\u2019ve had a deliberate set of execution around our rate plan there, so that\u2019s the first element around why you see a smaller level of rate in small than middle.","The second one really is around our express business, which think of it as the straight through processing of small commercial, really has a more prescriptive flat rating environment, and so when we see some of the pressures of rate reductions in workers\u2019 comp given the extraordinarily profitability on that line over time, we see that more immediately impact that business. Those are the two reasons that are driving the small commercial.","Brian Meredith","And on the property, large account property? ","Greg Toczydlowski","What was your question on the large property?","Brian Meredith","How is that--the large account property, how is that playing out from a rate perspective right now? Is it getting the rate that you kind of need in that area, or not?","Greg Toczydlowski","Given the hurricanes were in the third quarter, we\u2019re very pleased with our agility one quarter in, in terms of what we\u2019ve been trying to do on the national property side. As Alan said, we think franchise value matters, and we\u2019re seeing that inside our numbers where we\u2019ve been able to push thoughtfully and, at the same time, retain the book of business.","Jay Benet","Brian, just one comment on top of that. Looking back over significant cat events over the years, the impact in the large property book on rate is usually two, three, even sometimes four quarters out, the peak of that, so we\u2019re optimistic that there could be more to come, but that\u2019s just looking at the historical trends. ","Alan Schnitzer","And we made good progress in the quarter.","Jay Benet","Yes.","Brian Meredith","Great, and then just on personal lines, and just on tax, I appreciate the comments on how it\u2019s going to fall to the bottom line, but I guess my question more on the personal line space is as you look out, understanding you need more rate to get to the right returns that you really want in that business, but should we expect that kind of your combined ratios, where you\u2019d like them to get, are going to be higher here going forward as a result of tax, and specifically related to at least certain states have return on capital type benchmarks that they look at, is there going to be pushback from those regulators on returns here with tax reform?","Michael Klein","Brian, it\u2019s Michael. Thanks for the question. I would say where you started is probably where we start, which is we\u2019re not at target returns yet and we\u2019ve got work to do. I think consistent with Alan\u2019s comments in the opening, a lower tax rate sort of helps move us closer but doesn\u2019t get us all the way there, so when you think about it from a filed rate and a regulatory standpoint, we certainly see and actually have seen just this week news from some regulators on the fact that they are thinking about the tax rate and looking to apply it in some of those conversations, but generally speaking it doesn\u2019t change the direction we need to move rates, particularly in auto. We still have work to do there to get to target returns, and we\u2019re going to continue down that path.","Brian Meredith","Right, it\u2019s just the magnitude you need going forward is probably less today than it would have been before tax reform?","Michael Klein","I would say all else being equal, but again to Alan\u2019s point earlier, you\u2019ve got expenses, you\u2019ve got loss experience, you\u2019ve got investment yield, a whole bunch of things that go into that mix, and it\u2019s just one factor that we need to consider.","Brian Meredith","Great, thanks for the answer. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette and & Woods. Please proceed.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m over-thinking this, but I guess I was surprised that the outlook for 2018 for personal insurance was only a slightly lower combined ratio with auto earned rates likely to approach double digits. Am I missing something there?","Michael Klein","Meyer, this is Michael. Thanks for the question, and appreciate it because Brian did give you the overall outlook for the segment, but there\u2019s a little bit of texture underneath. So if you think about auto specifically when you see the 10-K outlook, what you\u2019re going to see is our commentary there is for improved margins and combined ratio. The home outlook, on the other hand, is broadly consistent both from a margin and a combined ratio standpoint, assuming more normalized levels of non-cat weather activity. When you put those two pieces together, you get improved margins and a slightly improved combined ratio in the aggregate.","Part of that, I guess the other factor is as auto premium is growing more than home, and auto carries a higher combined ratio, mix impacts the adjustment in the combined ratio. ","Meyer Shields","Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks. Second, I guess this is a broader question. You\u2019ve talked a lot in the past about how some elements of exposure act like rate. Are those elements more, I guess, reflective of the price of the exposure to the values that are being insured, or of exposure unit growth or on a real basis?","Alan Schnitzer","I\u2019m not totally sure I understand the question, but I think it\u2019s more of a value than it is unit, right? You increase the value of a unit and it\u2019s that increase in exposure that behaves more like rate. When you actually add another unit of exposure, you have another unit of loss content, so I think that\u2019s the right way to think about it.","Meyer Shields","Okay, perfect. That\u2019s exactly what I was asking.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah Dewitt with JP Morgan. Please proceed.","Sarah Dewitt","Hey, good morning. Wanted to try one more on the tax rate. What would the pro forma tax rate have been this year under U.S. tax reform?","Jay Benet","Actually, it\u2019s not something we actually calculated, so I think we would suggest you do the same thing - just look at what the NII was for the tax exempt portfolio and then for everything else, apply the 21% rate. But we haven\u2019t done the calculation.","Sarah Dewitt","Okay. Yes, I\u2019m coming up with some slightly different numbers than in the previous question, so just--I mean, if you were willing to disclose that, I think that would be helpful.","Jay Benet","Well just to add, the information is in the supplement, so maybe it\u2019s something Gabby can follow up with you on.","Sarah Dewitt","Okay, great. Thank you. Then secondly, just on the auto insurance underlying combined ratio, it improved nicely this quarter but it\u2019s still above 100. How long should we be thinking about it will take to get below 100, given some of the pricing actions you\u2019re taking offset by the new business penalty?","Michael Klein","Thanks Sarah, it\u2019s Michael. I want to just put a point on Brian\u2019s comment earlier about reflecting seasonality to start with. So if you\u2019re looking at Page 15 and you\u2019re looking at the 101 for the full year versus the 104 for the quarter, that is pretty consistent with the seasonality we would typically see in the quarter. In terms of how long it takes, I think we\u2019re certainly optimistic, and as we said last quarter, we feel good about the progress we\u2019re making towards our target combined ratio and see that continuing as we look ahead into \u201918 and \u201919. ","I think with the outlook that we\u2019ve given you for RPC, you can sort of make your own estimate of what the earned rate will be, apply a loss trend and get to an earned combined ratio pretty quickly, and I guess at this point as we look at our experience, we don\u2019t see anything that would cause us to tell you to do it any differently. ","Sarah Dewitt","Okay, great.","Jay Benet","Just as a follow-up to your tax question, in terms of the going forward approach to calculating an effective tax rate, what I said is absolutely on point - there is a little bit of foreign income that\u2019s taxed at a slightly different rate, but that shouldn\u2019t matter. That will matter more this year than in the future because of today\u2019s 35% tax rate versus the future. ","But one of the other things that we should point out, and you\u2019ll see it in the press release, we did have a favorable tax settlement earlier in the year that would have affected this year\u2019s effective tax rate, so if you\u2019re going to a pro forma for this year, you have to take that into account. Then in addition to that, I mentioned in my commentary that we did some tax planning initiatives in the year that had some impact on the effective tax rate as well, so really the calculation you want to do is not about this year, it\u2019s about going forward.","Sarah Dewitt","Okay, great. Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Okay, this will be our last question, please.","Operator","Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed.","Larry Greenberg","Thank you. If you can believe it, I still have a question to ask. So going back to tax reform and the level playing field, aside from the benefits that might be there on the M&A side, from an operating standpoint or from a business line standpoint, where do you think the most concrete benefits might arise given the more level playing field?","Alan Schnitzer","You know, I guess the way we think about that is the tax line is an expense line like any other expense line that we work into our pricing models, and to the extent that we\u2019ve got a level playing field and aren\u2019t at a disadvantage in that regard, I think again on a relative basis from a pricing perspective, that helps. I would say after M&A, and maybe even before M&A, that that\u2019s a significant factor in terms of a level playing field.","Larry Greenberg","But in terms of business insurance, specific lines, there is none that necessarily jump out more than others? ","Alan Schnitzer","I think the same math applies to all of our pricing models for all of our products, so I don\u2019t think I would make a distinction there. ","Larry Greenberg","Okay. Then just with better economic growth perhaps on the horizon, do you think that all things equal, small commercial premium growth should maybe catch up to the middle market and maybe even grow faster in an improving economic environment?","Alan Schnitzer","I\u2019m not really sure how to answer that question. I do think across all of our businesses, we\u2019re pretty well leveraged and pretty well positioned to benefit from an improving economic environment. In terms of--you know, if you\u2019re asking about growth in GDP by small enterprise versus large, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve got a better view on that than you or anyone else. If you\u2019re talking about our own market position, small versus large, there\u2019s so many things that go into growth and we actually don\u2019t think about it that way. We execute, as you\u2019ve heard us say many times, at a very granular level, so whether it\u2019s small or large, we\u2019re trying to keep our best business, improve the profitability on the business where we need to, and do a lot of hustle in leveraging our competitive advantages, trying to generate new business. When that very granular strategy adds up to growth, we grow, so that\u2019s the way I think about it and we don\u2019t really think about the small differently than the large from that perspective.","Larry Greenberg","Great, thanks.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the presentation back to Ms. Nawi. Please proceed.","Gabriella Nawi","Excellent.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We\u2019re quite pleased with the strong results we posted this quarter, particularly given the magnitude of our catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather losses. Operating income was $673 million or $1.93 per share. Operating return on equity was 11.04% and we continue to make great progress on lifting our returns, largely in response to continuing very low interest rates and continuing volatile weather. Who would have thought that we\u2019d be talking about a polar vortex in July and at 2.5% ten year treasury in 2014?","As demonstrated on slide four of the webcast, comparing this quarter\u2019s earnings to last year is more than accounted for by the tax and legal settlement gains of $122 million, recognized in last year\u2019s second quarter as well as the difference in catastrophe losses quarter-to-quarter.","The short story for each of our business segments is good. In Personal Insurance we are really pleased with the marketplace response and production trends. The manual personal auto program Quantum 2.0. While we need more talent, more time and data, the very early on loss indications are encouraging and consistent with our expectations. Our financial, professional and international insurance segment produced record results, with good results from both the bond and financial products business and the international business.","In Business Insurance, we continue to generate strong returns as underlying, underwriting margins on an earned basis, continued to expand and written rate gains in the quarter approximated loss trend. Because there was so much interest in our assessment of the rate environment in Business Insurance, we are going to spend a few minutes on that this morning, before I turn it over to Jay.","At our recent Investor Day, we were struck by the fact that one analyst asked a question about rate, but started off by saying that he knew we didn\u2019t like talking about aggregate rate indicators. That\u2019s just not so, but the critical caveats in discussing the headline rate, are that first we do not manage rate in the aggregate. We manage it account-by-account or class-by-class, and the actions that we take ultimately add up to a single number.","This granularity is evidenced on slide 15 of the webcast, which we\u2019ve shared with you before.","The slide is the distribution by rate gain of our commercial accounts business for the second quarter of 2014. And Brian will talk more about this analysis later.","Second, we believe that there can be an incorrect assessment of the competitive environment, based upon the direction of the headline number. Let me say again what I\u2019ve said many times before, we are a return driven organization.","We have talked with you before and have shared with you data, which demonstrates that the success we are having in improving returns, is based upon achieving rate gains on our poor performing business and maximizing retention on our best performing business. And we\u2019ve also said before, if we are successful, the headline rate gain will inevitably decline over time.","There is a conventional reaction amongst many industry observers that this decline reflects as many we put it, a more competitive environment. We just don\u2019t see it that way, given our ability to continue to achieve strong levels of retention at increasing returns approaching our targets. If we have an account where we\u2019ve been successful at increasing returns over time and that account has now reached an appropriate level of profitability, it would be unwise of us to attempt to continue to increase rate significantly on that account and risk the relationship with the agent and customer.","Consequently, we just caution everyone from reacting to the decline in the headline number as an indication that the environment generally has become meaningfully and broadly more competitive.","At least for us the environment has become more rate adequate and we are executing account-by-account and class-by-class. So now after three plus years of actions resulting in improved returns and profitability the question is where from here. We\u2019ve been reluctant to use the phrase soft landing because we believe that the phrase is often mischaracterized to mean that somehow we have finished attempting to improve the performance of our portfolio.","Nothing can be further from the truth, we remain concerned that weather volatility remains problematic and we are not convinced that each of our catastrophe exposed property accounts is priced to reflect that volatility. In addition not every line or every class of business is performing at the same level. For example we are not satisfied with the returns on our commercial auto book particularly in select and we will continue to analyze that portfolio and take the actions necessary to improve it.","So we have more work to do, but there are lots of accounts that after years of successful rate and underwriting actions are now at return levels that are consistent with our return threshold and our expression of the soft landing relates to that portion of the book what we have achieved so much. We don\u2019t see anything in the marketplace that suggests that we are at a precipice whether the increased churning of accounts were significant across the board, the rate of declines are imminent.","Of course we could be wrong about this, we know we operate in a fragmented marketplace with lots of competition. But we can only share with you our strategy. From our view it is more or the same and as we share with you at Investor Day we are going to relentlessly leverage competitive advantages. It should allow us to out select and out price our competition. We expect to produce earnings and capital substantially in excess of what we need to support our business and we will continue to return that excess capital to shareholders.","In short, nothing new and no shift, we feel very well positioned to continue our mission to creating superior shareholder value. And with that let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay Benet","Thanks Jay. Let me start by saying that we are very pleased with our results this quarter particularly taking weather into account. Our investment results continue to be very solid driven by private equity returns as were our underlined underwriting results. Within underwriting earned rate increases continue to exceed loss cost trends in each of our business segments. Al though the benefit to earnings into loss ratio was partially offset by higher non-CAT weather related losses this quarter versus the prior year quarter.","Underwriting also benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development of $183 million pre-tax down slightly from the prior year quarter and was negatively impacted by CAT losses of $436 million pre-tax up $96 million from the prior year quarter. We provided two analyses in the webcast this quarter to help you better understand the relationship of operating income to both the prior year quarter and to analyst estimates.","Jay already discussed the first analysis shown on page four of the webcast which provides insight as to why operating income decreased from the prior year quarter. The second analysis shown on page five of the webcast provides insight as to why operating income was less than the consensus estimate. The CAT loss estimates contained within the consensus estimates where significantly lower than our actual CAT losses. We hope this type of analysis is helpful to you.","Each of our business segments once again experienced net favorable prior year reserve development and BI net favorable development of $25 million was driven by better than expected loss experience in general liability excess coverages for accident years 2008-2012 resulting from a more favorable legal and judicial environment than we had expected. This was partially offset by an $87 million increase to our environment reserves.","Net favorable reserve development of a $146 million in FP&II primarily resulted from better than expected results in contract surety within bond and financial products. While in PI net favorable development of $12 million was primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in home owners and other were non-CAT weather related losses in the 2013 accident year. Year-to-date on a combined stat basis for all of our US subs only accident year 2004 and prior developed unfavorably by a very modest amount $73 million due to the strengthening of environmental reserves.","All other accident years 2005-2013 developed favorably. We\u2019ve included an overview of CAT reinsurance coverage on page 22 of the webcast which has been structured in a way that is generally consistent with the prior year. Effective July 1, we renewed our Gen CAT treaty keeping both the attachment point and the dollar amount of recovered loss as the same as last year.","Recovered losses of up to $400 million within the $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion layer, also effective July 1, we renewed our North East Gen CAT treaty with the same $2.25 billion attachment point as last year with an increased dollar amount of recovered losses up to $850 million this year as compared to $600 million last year. Given the current reinsurance marketplace both renewals were accomplished at lower rates online and with improved terms and conditions, including amending the loss accounts definition so that all win losses have a duration of a 168 hours rather than 96 hours.","A more complete description of our CAT reinsurance coverage including a description of our two long point PRE-CAT bonds our Gen-CAT aggregate excess of loss treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences, our earthquake coverage and our international coverage is included in our second quarter 10-Q which we filed earlier today as well as in our 10-K.","We continue to generate much more capital than is needed to support our businesses allowing us to return $1.065 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $190 million and repurchased $875 million of our common shares under our publicly announced share repurchase program consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy. Operating cash flows remain strong a little over $600 million. And we ended the quarter with over $1.8 million of holding company liquidity. All of our capital ratios exceeded our target levels and we ended the quarter with a debt to a capital ratio of 21.3% well within our target range.","Net unrealized investment gains rose to approximately $3.1 billion pre-tax or $2 billion after tax up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion respectively at the beginning of the year due to lower interest rates. And book value per share of $75.32 was 30% higher than a year ago and over a 7% higher than the beginning of the year.","One final note as you know we are revising our business segments and related disclosures to reflect the management changes that were announced on June of 10th and became effect on July 1.","Accordingly we report third quarter results using the new segment structure. We are currently in the process of restating our 2013 Form 10-K and our second quarter 2014 Form 10-Q and our financial supplements for the periods contained therein to reflect the new segment structure. And we expect to make these restated documents available to you in early September. So with that let me turn things over to Brain.","Brian McLean","Thanks Jay, in business insurance second quarter operating income was $409 million and the combined ratio was 99%. The underlying combined ratio which excludes the impact of CAT\u2019s and prior year reserve development was 92.1% for the quarter, an improvement of a 4 percentage point year-over-year. And 90.1% for the first half of 2014, an improvement of 2.5 points over the first half of 2013, the point of improvement in the quarter was driven by about 2 points of earned rate in excess of loss trends partially offset by about a point of non-CAT weather losses.","So despite the significant impact of weather solid profitability in the quarter. Turning to production trends beginning on page 11, retention of 81% was strong and slightly higher than recent periods. New business volume of $486 million was 8% was higher quarter-over-quarter while renewal premium change was down somewhat from recent periods at about 6%.","The 6% included pure rate increases of about 4% which was about a point lower than the last quarter. As has been the case for last 13 quarters all major lines of business had positive rate change with the largest change this quarter coming in commercial auto. Not surprisingly auto was the line of business with the lowest return and accordingly the greatest rate need. Loss trend for the segment continued to run at about 4% so on an aggregate written basis, rate gains approximated our current view of loss trends.","We believe the production results both in the aggregate and by line of business are appropriate given our view of product returns. But as Jay mentioned in his comments we don\u2019t manage the business in an aggregate or total line level. We execute it account-by-account or class-by-class and this is demonstrated on slide 15 which displays the distribution of renewal rate changes for commercial accounts in the second quarter.","As you can see from the slide most accounts received a single digit rate increase. But there were numerous accounts that got a rate increase greater than 10% or got some level of rate decrease. There were also some general trends in the portfolio, recently larger accounts have lower average rate changes. And has been the case for several quarters commercial auto accounts have higher average rate changes and there\u2019s always individual account loss experience matters.","But the real take away from this slide is that the aggregate rate number is simply an average of thousands of individual account actions. And accordingly success in this business is not about achieving a higher aggregate rate number, it\u2019s about doing the right things for the right account and generating an appropriate return over time.","So in this context our fundamental approach is unchanged and the results continue to be encouraging. Simply put, we are retaining a very high percentage of our best performing accounts at relatively modest rate increases. While on our poor performing business, we continue to get rate increases significantly above loss trend, with lower retentions. We are comfortable moving away from business where returns remain well below target levels and as always we actively look for new business opportunities with appropriate returns.","We continue to be very comfortable with how our organization is executing at the granular level and accordingly feel very good about the results.","In the financial, professional and international segment we had record operating income of $254 million, which was 65% higher than the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher levels of favorable prior year reserve development, improved underlined, underwriting margins, lower catastrophe losses and the inclusion of the Dominion.","The underlined combined ratio for the quarter was a very strong 89 two, a slight improvement from the prior year. The improvement was due to the 2014 exit from a management liability excessive loss reinsurance treaty, along with earned rate increases in excess of loss cost trend across the segment largely offset by the impact of the Dominion.","Net written premium was up 38% in the quarter compared to the prior year, due to the inclusion of Dominion. In the management liability business within bond of financial products, retention of 84% and new business of $37 million were both consistent with recent periods in prior year, while renewal premium changed of about 4% was down somewhat from recent periods.","In the international, retention remains strong at 80% while renewal premium change improved to 3% and new business was up year-over-year due to the impact of Dominion, so overall a great quarter for the segment.","In our personal insurance business, operating income of $75 million for the quarter was down 47% compared to the second quarter of 2013, driven by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and home owners, along with higher levels of catastrophe related losses in both auto and home.","The underlined combined ratio for the quarter was 89.8 a slight improvement over the second quarter of 2013 with lower underwriting expenses and rate increases in excess of loss trends, largely offset by higher non-cap weather related losses.","Looking specifically at auto on the production side, retention remains strong at 82%, renewal premium change was about 6%, while new business volume of 139 million was once again up significantly versus recent periods due to the rollout of Quantum Auto 2.0. We continue to be very pleased with the early results for Quantum Auto 2.0, the product is now live in 31 states and those states represent about 85% of our countrywide auto new business production. In the states where we\u2019ve launched the product, we\u2019ve seen quoted policies increase more than 10%, while the number of policies issued has more than doubled from pre-launch levels.","In addition, we continue to make progress on the expense initiatives announced a year-ago that are fundamental to our ability to make our auto product more price competitive. To date we\u2019ve executed on initiatives responsible for about 75% of the $140 million run rate savings target and we remain on track to achieve the full run rate sales by the end of the year in line with our original expectations.","Turning to auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio of 96.2 for the quarter, was a slight improvement compared to the second quarter of 2013 with earned rate increases more than offsetting loss trend, and the impact of higher mix of new business versus renewal business volumes. Our current view of auto loss cost trend remains at about 4% with no significant change in the underlying texture from previous quarters.","Looking at homeowners, production was strong in the quarter with renewal premium change of about 8% while retention remained at 84%, new business volume of $85 million was up from the prior year quarter and recent periods due in part to account rounding on our auto new business. From a profitability perspective, the underlying combined ratio of 81.5 was in line with the second quarter of 2013, with earned rate increases in excess of loss trend and lower expenses, offset by non-CAT weather-related losses.","So overall in personal insurance, we saw strong profitability and an improving production picture. With that let me turn it back over to Gabi.","Gabriella Nawi","I\u2019m sorry there is an addition from Jay Benet.","Jay Benet","Yes thanks Gabi, before we open for questions I did want to mention one additional item. We\u2019d be remiss if we did not say how pleased we were to have been recognized as a A++ company by AMBEST [ph] this past May so we just thought we\u2019d end with that and we\u2019d be happy to take your questions now.","Gabriella Nawi","Kelly we are ready for the question and answer portion. May I ask that you all limit yourself to one question and one follow-up please? Thank you.","Question-And-Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Yes, thanks couple of quick questions here for you. First of all Jay, just curious, if I look at the business insurance, and you kind of strip out the reserve releases and you can normalize for CAT losses. I kind of come up with about a 12% underlying return equity for the business, I guess my first question is that right, and is that about where you\u2019re kind of targeting given the current interest rate environment?","Brian McLean","I\u2019ll answer the second part of it; I\u2019ll let Jay Benet \u2013 if he does the math in his head. We\u2019ve been saying for some time that our stated target of achieving the mid-teens return on equity overtime was simply really not achievable in this interest rate environment, but we were willing to keep it as a statement, an aspiration goal but also because so much, so many of our systems and our culture are geared around it. Having said that, we\u2019ve chosen to avoid the notion of an artificial ceiling on what rate adequacy or return adequacy is on an individual line or an individual business. Some of that is driven by competitive dynamics, what is the rest of the marketplace doing, some of it is based upon capacity.","So I \u2013 it feels obviously at 2.5% tenure treasury, a 12% number feels pretty good, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to not pick the actions on an account-by-account or class-by-class basis, that would continue to lift it if it\u2019s possible. So that\u2019s really our honest assessment of it, it feels pretty good to us, but maybe there\u2019s more and we\u2019re certainly going to try, but that again is a specific comment more than it is an aggregate rate number. It\u2019s so important that we always keep that in mind, we price individual accounts, we don\u2019t price the portfolio.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","But if you\u2019re pricing right now in line with trend, isn\u2019t that kind of mean you\u2019re assuming that return to adequate?","Jay Fishman","I\u2019m sorry Brian try me again.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","You said you\u2019re pricing, you\u2019re pricing your business insurance in line with loss trend right?","Jay Fishman","Oh no, no what Brian said was that our best accounts are getting modest loss trend. I believe I\u2019m trying to go back to his comments and that our poorer performing accounts, whatever that means in that framework if the three years of rate increases, but there are always poorer performing accounts, if the poor performing accounts are getting significantly more rate increase at lower retention.","Jay Benet","So another way to say that Brian is this quarter, the way the arithmetic worked out, is rate that we got on the entire portfolio approximated the aggregate loss trend, but that could be very different and we could be thrilled with the result or unhappy with the result either direction depending on how we get there.","Jay Fishman","And I think the other part of that, that really is important, is that we wouldn\u2019t contemplate that we can improve our profitability by getting meaningful rate increase on our best performing business. Our focus there is to do our best to offset trend and to maximize retention. Our improvement in profitability is going to come from identifying those segments that under perform. And continuing to make real progress there, I recall in the last quarter, we actually put up a slide which showed the rate gain in our fifth bucket in commercial accounts I think.","I can\u2019t remember whether it was commercial or middle market, but compared to the number of accounts in the rate gain to the previous year\u2019s quarter, and the rate gain in that fifth bucket, was 21% I think last year and 20% this year was the rate gain. That\u2019s where the improvement and profitability is going to come from, not just from that shift class, but that\u2019s the example here. It\u2019s going to be identifying those segments that continue to underperform and continuing to drive one.","Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS","Great, thanks.","Jay Fishman","The other thing I would add before I\u2019ll address your first question is that we have this internal discussion about margin improvement. And you have to look at it in terms of what you\u2019re talking about. Are you talking about combined ratio or you are talking about dollars. And when you talk about combined ratio, now if you do the arithmetic, if you\u2019re covering loss trend let\u2019s make up some numbers, let\u2019s say you have a 60% loss ratio, obviously premiums were at the 100%.","If you\u2019re covering loss trend that\u2019s 4% with rate increases, you\u2019re multiplying the denominator and the numerator by the same number. And you come up with the same combined ratio at the end of it 60%, loss ratio, 60% in this case, which you lose track of in that of the dollars because you\u2019re applying a 4% increase to a 100 and another 4% increase to 60% of that. So you\u2019re actually increasing the dollars of margin and increasing profitability, therefore, even when you\u2019re loss trend.","So I just say that for all of you to keep in my mind that you\u2019ve got to look at it as to what question you\u2019re really asking. Is combined ratio changing or dollars of margin changing. Getting back to the first question about the overall returns, we do an analysis of our quarters, our year-to-dates. And if I look at the year-to-date operating return on equity, which was 14.6%, there is prior year development in there. Prior year development to our accounts, because a lot of it relates to recent periods where we\u2019ve seen trends different than what we expected and they\u2019ve been favorable.","So in any given period, you can adjust for, but if you look at the 14.6% and back out the amount of PYD and divide by the average equity, you\u2019ll come up with something that looks like a proxy for an accident year, this year. So that\u2019s a way of looking at it, but as Jay said, we look at these returns over time, and we try to manage as close as we can to that mid-teen\u2019s goal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Hi, good morning. I was hoping you could maybe review the topical issue the connections between the insurance market and primary market, particularly in the large account basis and just giving the fact that we\u2019ve seen a lot of rate decline and of reinsurance and how should we think about that affecting your businesses as the competitive environment changes a bit?","Jay Fishman","Hi Paul, it\u2019s Jay Fishman. We think a lot of pitching a little on that, first I just observed that broadly speaking, we are really not a large account writer. I suspect in the context of the question that you\u2019re asking, we are a small commercial and middle market account company. We do large accounts on a fee for service basis that are largely independent of the reinsurance decisions. And we obviously do some national property business; we certainly do that for large accounts.","Anecdotally, although some evidence I think exists, the layered national property business, and my recollection, we did this last quarter. I think it\u2019s less than 5% of our premium business overall but the layered large account property business is a much more a price sensitive price driven marketplace, more challenging than it was before.","Now there are returns in that segment that are awfully attractive, and so you\u2019ve got to balance up the notion of competitive dynamics within the overall returns. But nonetheless, I think you\u2019re seeing, we think you\u2019re seeing some of the changes in the new capital formation. Whether it\u2019s reinsurance by the way, or excess in surplus, bumping into that layered national property account business.","And I would say on a primary side, for us, that\u2019s probably where the impact is most significant. I\u2019m trying to see if anybody else here has a different view? We\u2019re really not \u2013 our treaty reinsurance is, for a company of our size, relatively modest. And so we\u2019ve got either savings opportunities, they\u2019re nice but they\u2019re not going to move the needle very much, or we can change the way in which we purchase. We can but more for the same dollars or less for even fewer dollars, but on the margin, it doesn\u2019t change anything.","I\u2019ve been asked a few times whether in this, is an opportunity for us, and I suspect that what people are thinking is, does the calculus behind primary exposure change? Would you be willing to do either different classes of business or more business, particularly in catastrophe exposed areas and rely more on reinsurance to produce an acceptable return.","So far the answer for us is no, that we worry a lot about the mismatch of business, we worry a lot about relying on reinsurance as a strategic solution rather than as a risk balancing factor, if you like. And the notion of expanding our liability base and relying on a reinsurance contract to bail us out.","We were not quite sure of that reinsurance capacity really sticks, is it permanent, is it really there for the long haul? It\u2019s just not clear to us yet. So for us, the answer is that the impact of all of this is not yet very much. We spend, not an insignificant amount, talking about it and thinking about ways in which it could impact us, but so far, I think you\u2019re hard pressed other than that layered national property business to find an area where it\u2019s really having an impact.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill","Maybe another fundamental question here, you\u2019d obviously talked a lot about how focusing on that renewal rate number and commercial insurance is not necessarily the best measure of what your assessment of the competitive environment. What\u2019s the alternative for us to look at and also illustrate?","Jay Fishman","That\u2019s actually a great question and I think you asked it actually in exactly the right way. It\u2019s not that the number doesn\u2019t have arithmetic meaning, we acknowledge it does, but the tendency to perceive it as a competitive indicator, we just don\u2019t see that. We\u2019ve always said, and have for many years, that retention is going to be the leading indicator of a changing competitive environment.","And I\u2019ll go back to the last really difficult pricing environment that we had, which was back into the \u201890s, you\u2019ll see retention rates in middle market drop down into the high 60s. And that really defined what was going on, there was tremendous churn in the marketplace. It didn\u2019t happen overnight, but retention rates declined and that followed, that led, if you will, the overall rate dynamic.","Now we haven\u2019t seen that yet, we haven\u2019t seen it on the way up, we haven\u2019t seen it \u2013 we\u2019re still on the way up, although we\u2019re at slower rates. We just haven\u2019t seen a drop in retention, and we said for a long time, that we think that\u2019s the principle indicator. Now we also, to provide whatever anecdotal observation we can, we often have provided you with commentary about what we\u2019re hearing from the field.","They had to take that with a bit of a grain of salt because it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right, but there are observations from people in the field dealing with individual accounts every day. And our comments remain, that there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019re hearing from our folks that would cause us to think that we\u2019re at a precipice or broadly a more meaningfully competitive environment, but I watch retention. And that\u2019s what I look at, and when I see a drop in that, that\u2019s when it\u2019s time to begin to understand what\u2019s going on in that local environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my call, my question is regarding to the segmentation changes and management change recently. Could you comment a little bit more on that?","Brian McLean","We have much more to say, we put out a press release its part of management\u2019s responsibility, our responsibility here is to make sure that the younger talent in the organization gets additional exposure internally, exposure externally and position the company for continuity and just felt to us like a very ordinary and inappropriate thing to do. The real alignment was to a great extent, driven by reporting relationships within those changes, so much more about the people than about any particular realignment about the business.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great just follow-on that and Jay has done a wonderful job for the company and the shareholders and is this the recent management change is part of evolution about how the boards think about the succession plan?","Jay Fishman","Well I would never speak for the board and so \u2013 we think we have a responsibility to develop talent and present to the board as solid a management team as we\u2019re capable of doing. And we\u2019re going to be a management team that\u2019s going to step up to that responsibility and not side step it. The depth of the folks in this place around here it never fails to amaze me.","The talent here is just remarkable. And my job particularly, is to make sure that those people get additional responsibility and additional exposure. And that when that time comes that it\u2019s very natural, there\u2019s nothing upsetting to the organization internally. There\u2019s nothing upsetting to the constituents externally, it\u2019s as it should be and that\u2019s really my goal. For I mean \u2013 I\u2019ll be 62 in November Brian I think is going to be 62 later this year. I think Jay Benet will be 62 in August, so we all \u2013 we\u2019re not Methuselah here, we\u2019re mere mortals and our time will come. And our job is to develop that next generation and present them and just have it not be a big deal.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie; please proceed with your question.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","Thanks, and I\u2019m not 62 yet so. Just two quick follow-up questions. The first is, I guess it was Brian\u2019s question and you answered that. Jay you said retentions, you haven\u2019t seen it on its way up. And I\u2019m trying to sort of think about those and you\u2019re right, we should focus on retentions and rate adequacy if so many lines are at rate adequacy shouldn\u2019t that eventually start class stating [ph] into better retentions and eventual growth in premiums?","Jay Fishman","Complicated question. I think that retention, something [indiscernible] taught me many years ago, that the real emotional content behind retention is agent comfortable, market comfortable, customer comfortable, a terrific set of circumstances where everybody feels good and fair and equitable in the relationship. And that will encourage accounts to stay where they are. And that\u2019s a really good thing, it\u2019s good for the accounts by the way.","We think tenure matters; we think it\u2019s a advantage, it\u2019s good for the agents. They can attend to things that they need to attend to and obviously it\u2019s good for the carriers that have the business. So the retention dynamic is, I think, really a reflection of the level of comfort of all of the parties to the transaction. And that\u2019s really good, that\u2019s a good thing. Dynamic of growth is a more challenging one. There\u2019s no green light that goes on that says, now we\u2019re interested in growing. Always interested in doing more business, always and when we can bring on new accounts and we have \u2013 we\u2019ve demonstrated this in slides in years gone by.","Recognizing that there is a, the internal expression is a new business penalty, but recognizing that there\u2019s a new business penalty associated with it, if we can see a pathway to bringing on new accounts, and over time managing them to acceptable returns, we\u2019re going to go ahead and do that, there\u2019s nothing different about that this month than there was last month. And it\u2019s not as if we weren\u2019t booking new business a year-ago when rates weren\u2019t as attractive as they are now. We were, we were as aggressive as we could be. And if anything, I would say that \u2013 if we had any disappoint, is that we weren\u2019t actually doing more notwithstanding our encouragement.","The thing to recognize is that, and again I\u2019ve said this before, I apologize for saying that so many times I don\u2019t want it to sound it as though we believe this because of this quarter and this is what we\u2019ve said. You\u2019re not going to grow your book by marginally changing your price attitude at the point of sale. First of all we don\u2019t have a price list. We don\u2019t have a price list; it\u2019s an individual underwriter sitting down with an agent talking about an individual account.","So it\u2019s not as if we can say lower prices by 3% or 4%, it just isn\u2019t that precise. And so the way you, the way you grow is by perceiving opportunity, typically by risk selection, either categories of risk, lines of business geographies that you weren\u2019t in before that amount for any number of reasons, you perceive opportunity for us Canada, terrific opportunity, Brazil a terrific opportunity.","We showed at Investor Day we\u2019ve grown our middle markets business. My recollection is like by 50% over eight or nine years from $2.1 billion to $3.2 billion in premiums. Now at the same time our construction surety business has shrunk pretty dramatically as a result of the environment we\u2019re in. And so you have to be \u2013 we\u2019re not in one market, we\u2019re 50 markets. And you have to be nimble enough to see the opportunities where they are and pursue them aggressively, but also be cautious enough to understand the risk presented in a changing set of circumstances and dial it back.","So we\u2019ve been growing in the lines of business here significantly, and either because circumstances change or we made mistakes in some markets than we did, we, we shrunk others, so it\u2019s all in net but it is in that granular dynamic.","Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie","My apologies for the fire alarm, just very quickly is there a portion of your book which can be potentially structured into a sidecar or an alternative capital provider, thanks.","Jay Fishman \u2013 I\u2019m reluctant to give a quick answer on something that, we haven\u2019t really thought about it, we haven\u2019t spent time contemplating it. I actually thought where you were heading was a portfolio transfer transaction, which we always think about, but I haven\u2019t thought about the sidecar dynamic and I\u2019d be reluctant to answer on the slide.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you. I had a question about Dominion actually, if I remember right, that was a business where you guys bought it was operating around a 100 combined, and it looks like you\u2019ve really turned that around very quickly,, just curious kind of where\u2019s that business running now. And maybe you can just talk a little bit about what actions you\u2019ve taken in order to kind of to get yourself to that place, thanks.","Alan Schnitzer","Sure Michael its Alan Schnitzer I\u2019ll handle that. I guess I would say, I would caution you from thinking that we\u2019ve turned it around that quickly there\u2019s certainly a lot integration work going on and we\u2019re still; we\u2019re still hard at work on that. So the improvement you\u2019re seeing I guess is your, you\u2019re looking at the results and seeing the combined ratio relative to what we guided you to and treating that to Dominion, that\u2019s actually not correct its mostly a reinsurance transaction and some large losses that were better than what we had in the \u201892. So it\u2019s actually not coming from the Dominion, but to get to your, to get to your question what are we doing?","We\u2019re doing all the sorts of things you\u2019d think that, that a company like us would be doing. We\u2019re working hard with Greg Toczydlowski in personal insurance and the whole business insurance team to bring all the know-how and sophistication in data and analytics, some scale and synergy advantage, but really just taking the know-how we have resident here at Travelers\u2019 and exporting it to that platform. And we feel very good about the opportunity, as good as we did when we signed up the deal, but I can\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s all been reflected in this quarter.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So then so the expense ratio benefit that we saw is primarily a result of the reinsurance, can you mention them?","Alan Schnitzer","No, no the expense benefit you saw does primarily come from the Dominion, but there is, there is a more than offsetting loss ratio deterioration from the Dominion. So on a net basis and an all win basis, loss and expense ratio, the Dominion is actually hurting, but it is helping on the expense ratio pretty significantly. And it\u2019s a loss ratio piece we think over that time, we\u2019ll be able to work through and bring to hurtle levels.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That makes sense.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Thanks very much. First I\u2019ve been covering the company and industry for a long time. I think we all understand the spring storms tend to be a heavy seasonal CAT quarter. I think it will be helpful for folks to get a perspective on what you would normalize annual CAT load to be. If I look back over say the past dozen years, I think the average is between 4 and 5 combined ratio points. Is that a good starting point?","Jay Fishman","And Jay, just for clarification you were talking about in the second quarter.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Correct, I was talking about \u2013 say for the full year I think that gives a better perspective.","Jay Benet","Actually, this is Jay Benet, Jay, actually if you go to the proxy, there\u2019s a discussion about results and in it we do talk about what the expectation was for the CATs in the year versus where we ended up. And my recollection is the numbers about $550 after tax dollars. In dollars yes, so we\u2019re just having somebody open up the proxy and make sure we\u2019re right about that.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Okay thank you, I can generally take a look at that. On the next issue it would be in terms of capital return, I\u2019m wondering if we were to think about out years, could Travelers ultimately be in a position where dividends plus share buy backs could exceed in your operating earnings?","Jay Benet","Not permanently, it can obviously year-to-year. And that\u2019s really a function of timing, but the only way that it could actually exceed earnings permanently would be if we look today at the company. That\u2019s the only way to do it, so you know not permanently, no.","Brian McLean","Jay let me just jump back, it\u2019s Brian McLean, you started with we all kind of know spring storms and volatility and clearly we do, but when we look at our data of particularly what\u2019s happened with spring weather over the course of the last \u2013 well since 2008, it\u2019s dramatically higher than what you would have seen in the previous 20 years. To the extent of you know a 3X kind of number and in fact that\u2019s not even counting the 2011 off the charts number that we had.","So we\u2019ve always known that we would have near term, short term volatility in our CAT numbers and everybody follows the industry, it\u2019s used to looking at that, but particularly for the second quarter tornado, hail activity and how our product is used to deal with that, we really have done a lot of thinking about what\u2019s the long term move to and whether we see continuing volatility in that number?","Jay Fishman","A good example anecdotal actually of the magnitude of the volatility, there was not two on the go, we didn\u2019t think about catastrophe loading auto, in personal auto. We do now and that\u2019s just the function of experience. So we\u2019re reacting to the changing weather patterns kind of almost on a real time basis. It\u2019s hard to answer the question at this point, of what a normal level is, that\u2019s why we talked about it so much over the last few years. There\u2019s been a driver of not only weight, but underwriting in terms of conditions; it\u2019s just proving to be a challenge.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Hi, good Morning. First question on the competitive environment, I think you\u2019ve done a good job explaining that it\u2019s largely unchanged. Jay, you mentioned that you think there is likely going to be a soft landing. Just curious sort of looking at the cycle versus the past, what\u2019s different and what gives you confidence that there is going to be a softer landing this time around?","Jay Fishman","Just because it\u2019s my opinion doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s so; I need to start off with that. It\u2019s just one persons point of view right, we\u2019ve been talking for years now about the fact that our view was that the magnitude of this cyclicality in our business, we thought would be lower than an historical experience. And it was driven by everything from much better data across the industry.","I\u2019ll exclude myself, but I think much better management in the industry than wasn\u2019t the case 20 years ago. You look at capital deployment philosophies; it\u2019s different than it was 20 years ago. I think Sarbanes Oxley and the attention of audit committees and boards to adequacy of reserves to the level, the procedures and policies around reserve setting has made them much more accurate.","It\u2019s not that people were abusing it before, it\u2019s that there\u2019s a whole different level of attention and focus on those initial picks, what\u2019s driving them, what are the factors for transparency that exists to what the governance committee, external auditors, internal auditors, boards, those are all things that will make the accounting and reserving process better. Never guarantee, we\u2019re all talking about the future but it will make it better and I think it has.","And I think as a consequence of that, the feedback move between clean performance and underwriters and pricing decisions is stunningly faster than it was 20 years ago. We actually are at a point now where we\u2019re booking weather dynamics virtually month-to-month. When I first started here, you were lucky if you had it in the quarter, that\u2019s the level of feedback there was. So the delay in understanding what\u2019s trans-factoring it back into reserving and changing pricing, was much more attenuated than it is today, its crisp.","And I\u2019ve listened to other companies and how they report, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re unique in that regard, I think \u2013 I listen to other companies and I\u2019m impressed by what I hear and the nature of controls and procedures and the thoughtfulness and I think is a consequence the magnitude \u2013 there\u2019ll always be some cyclicality here and there\u2019s cyclicality in every business. But I said, coming close to probably 8 or 9 years ago, I thought that the amplitude on the way up as well as the amplitude on the way down were going to be much more narrow.","I think that was true obviously on the way up we will now see it on the way down. So that\u2019s what I think, and we\u2019ll find out, I think the leadership in this industry has come to understand that attempting to grow market share by marginally changing price, and actually creating share holder value from it is impossible. I think about it all the time, and I don\u2019t know how to do it and I\u2019m not sure anybody else does. And so we\u2019ve all learned within our own cultures and our own environment and our own strategies, how to manage our businesses to create shareholder value, that\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to do.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Thank you and just a quick follow-up on the Quantum 2.0, I think you said that the results weren\u2019t what the expectations, just a little bit more color on that. You\u2019ve had 6 months, and so what do you think in terms of loss and what\u2019s your expectations thanks.","Jay Fishman","I\u2019m going to turn it over to Greg in a second to talk about loss trend, but it would be remiss if I didn\u2019t observe, because I think he takes it for granted on this. We mentioned that the number of quoted policies is actually up 10%. That\u2019s one of the really wonderful surprises here, we thought going into this, that we were being quoted everywhere because of the comparative rating process. And it was not our going in expectation that by putting in a different model, that we would actually increase the number of quotes.","And so what\u2019s been \u2013 that 10% is a big number and what\u2019s impressive about that, is the agent understanding and reaction of the Travelers product of Quantum 2 as a legitimate competitive product and they\u2019re embracing it in their quoting process. So that\u2019s where we loss trend, but we\u2019ve to some extent, taken for granted internally the increase in quotes but it\u2019s a substantive plus.","Brian McLean","Absolutely and I think that echoes about how we feel about loss performance, we\u2019re very encouraged when we saw that increase in quote flow that Jay talked about. Obviously our focus then shifts right to the margin about how we\u2019re feeling about the profitability in that business given that we\u2019ve just launched our three largest states last month. We\u2019re not up on our 1 year anniversary, obviously we don\u2019t have a credible set of earned premium yet to really declare a victory, but our focus is really looking at long-term surrogates of profit right now, including the mix of business, short-tail coverage\u2019s like the frequency on physical damage coverage and all of those things that we\u2019re looking at, they\u2019re right within expectation.","So we\u2019ll continue to aggressively measure the ultimate combined ratio, but all those proxies that we look at are within expectations. So we\u2019re feeling as good about the quote flow that Jay talked about that we are with the early loss indicators.","Gabriella Nawi","Before we go to the next question, Jay Benet has a correction.","Jay Benet","It\u2019s a comment more than a correction. We said we would give you the number from the proxy as it relates to the quote, unquote normal CAT losses. And what we\u2019re remembering was actually from two years ago, the proxy from 2013 had $645 million as the after tax cost associated with CAT. So we had $550 before, and as I\u2019m reflecting on that, the thing I\u2019d want to share with you is really the fragility of these kinds of estimates, because looking at the $550 going to $650; it\u2019s not a reflection of increased exposure.","It\u2019s really a reflection of trying to refine year-over-year what these CAT estimates are. And it\u2019s not all that long ago that if you ask the same question, we would have said something like $350 million after tax. And thinking back to those times, it\u2019s our exposure base was actually quite a lot larger than that. So this notion of \u2013 so while we\u2019re saying this is quote, unquote normal, I just want to highlight the fragility of the estimates.","Gabriella Nawi","Great, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR","Hi. Thank you. I have a couple on reserves and it\u2019s in the commercial area, you commented that asbestos environment led to kind of 08 to 12 releases. Can we infer just kind of from a normal claim closing pattern on general liability, that anything you\u2019d get 08 and prior in that area is kind of \u2013 you would have seen it by now?","Jay Benet","This is Jay Benet, when we\u2019re doing; we\u2019re dealing with reserves, by definition we\u2019re dealing with incomplete information. So we\u2019re looking at new information that\u2019s coming in every quarter and evaluating that with regard to whatever the assumptions have been. So I wouldn\u2019t look at any one of our reserves as being at finality. We\u2019re always looking at the flow of information and adjusting. There are times when you see some things; you\u2019re not sure whether you\u2019re going to react in full or in part to it. So I think it\u2019s the best I can do to answer your question.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR","Okay. Yeah I mean I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of \u2013 because there\u2019s some PL and GL but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not as long as like asbestos environmental, so I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of, if there really even is the potential for a lot more to come from 08 and prior?","Jay Benet","I mean our reserves are always a best estimate, so we don\u2019t really comment on whether they\u2019re going to change, we\u2019ll see what the data says going forward, there\u2019s always new information coming.","Jay Fishman","I\u2019d just make an observation, asbestos and environmental is a general liability exposure. The difference there is that particularly in the asbestos arena, much of it came from a time when there were no policy aggregates, there were per occurrence aggregates that we started on a mid basis.","I think we ended up with policy aggregate starting in the early 80s. So that was pre dated that, but liability is a policy that lasts forever, you can always have things \u2013 you just never know.","Gabriella Nawi","Great, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I guess question I had was on loss trend, you talk about a loss trend in business insurance of roughly around 4%. And I\u2019m wondering is that the number you\u2019ve priced for or is that what you are observing, because seemingly what you\u2019ve been pricing before for the past, you know five years. You\u2019ve seen something less than that given the reserve releases. So when you talk about that number what exactly are you referring to?","Brian McLean","Our actuaries, our finance, our business folks are always looking at what they think frequency and severities going to be and you know, building in you know various assumptions they take into account, what recent trends have been. There\u2019s always the question of gee, if you\u2019d seen \u2013 and make up an example, if you\u2019ve seen recent inflation running at 1% or whatever, what does that mean going forward? Is it going to continue at 1% or is it going to get better, is it going to get worse? So at a very granular level, we\u2019re making assumption everyday and pricing and reserving as to what the future has in store based on current events and past trends.","And when you look at the kind of environment that we\u2019re faced with today, looking at very tame inflation, but some of the factors at work as to creating uncertainty as to what those inflation rates are going to be going forward. You have to take that into account and ultimately, that along with every other assumption comes down to a series of numbers for frequency and severity.","And things have been running pretty moderately, but when we say there\u2019s a 4% trend factor and you go back in time, I think you\u2019re absolutely right in saying well maybe it was actually a little less severe than we had expected. So we had favorable development, but going forward, you have to make a determination as to whether that\u2019s going to continue or whether the world is going to change.","Jay Fishman","Right so specifically Jay, when we say this quarter 4% loss trend, we\u2019re talking about both what we\u2019re seeing is trend in the current year, and what we\u2019re pricing for. And obviously that\u2019s an aggregate number so it\u2019s all over the place by different lines. As we have prior year development, we\u2019re looking at why we had that development and does that change our outlook of what the current year should be?","So an example of one which usually wouldn\u2019t would be if we had favorable development on prior year CAT, we\u2019d probably say that doesn\u2019t \u2013 unless they were dramatic, wouldn\u2019t fundamentally change our view of CAT\u2019s this year. There are other things that you could obviously say would change it. So the base year does move but, its \u2013","Jay Benet","Yeah and the most volatile part of it is non-CAT weather. Our loss trend numbers make an assumption about non-CAT weather and that\u2019s obviously, at least I think, the most unpredictable part of that loss trend dynamic, it is one of the reasons why you\u2019re hearing us relentlessly talk about upset by favorable non-CAT weather or upset by adverse non-CAT weather, it\u2019s just who knows.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","On that topic you talked about non-CAT weather relative to a year-ago being worse. Can you speak to non-CAT weather relative to a normal second quarter, was this worse than you might have expected normally, instead of just compared to last year versus the normal expectation.","Jay Benet","I\u2019ll take that and it\u2019s a little different BI to PI so in, in personal insurance we would say this quarter was the non-CAT weather was about normal. It was a couple of points worse than last year, which was abnormally low. In BI this quarter non-CAT weather was a little bit high, so about a point unfavorable to both last year, which was kind of normal and what we would have expected this year. And the difference there is especially when you get into tornado, hail the, the impacts in the commercial business can be really random and volatile.","Personal lines you have a storm and it hits the neighborhood and we can kind of see the claims. In business insurance you can hit our risk or not hit our risk and it could dramatically change the number. So that\u2019s the perspective relative to kind of normal. PI about normal this quarter BI a little bit worse than normal.","Gabriella Nawi","Great. And this will be our last and final question.","Operator","And the last question comes from Josh Stirling with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","So we talked a lot about reserves. I was wondering if you could give us some color, I know it\u2019s the best estimate, but there\u2019s a range of different approaches across the industry. Some companies consistently target something like a zero favorable development targets on consistently target a much larger number.","You guys, just from observation, seem to be sort of in the middle of the range, but everybody is thinking about earnings over the next few years, pricing slowing you think you\u2019re guiding in your \u2013 in your outlooks actually talk about how underwriting margins and the underlying basis seem to be slowing and stabilizing. I\u2019m wondering what we should be expecting you guys truly would like to be sort of a normal level of favorable development, when you think about sort of what\u2019s your real philosophy really. And through the cycle or look like, it\u2019d be really helpful for us?","Brian McLean","Looking at each other, Jay and I my own view is that our goal is to get it right. If we could pick the right number, and first of all, that\u2019s our responsibility, our obligation is to record a best estimate. So that\u2019s what we do, we attempt to record best estimate. And the accounting rules are critical, they\u2019re a really big deal, but it\u2019s also how you price and how you think about the returns in your business. And where you perceive risk versus rewards.","So the importance of making it our best estimate is just critical.","We struggle to figure out how to manage the business if we were recording something other than that, because we priced to that loss ratio, we priced to that trend, we priced to that yield curve, it\u2019s just critical for us. So I\u2019m sure Jay and I would say this but \u2013 give you the same answer, which is our expectation sitting here today, is that there won\u2019t be any development.","We think we\u2019ve got it right, it doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have issues that we\u2019re watching and aware of and you\u2019ll ask us often about emerging trends and claims. We keep track of all that, but our goal is to get it right and so the notion of a question about a normal level of reserved development, just doesn\u2019t resonate with us. We don\u2019t think of it that way, we don\u2019t think there is a normal level of reserve development.","Jay Benet","And I fully agree with that. It\u2019s always about best estimates; it\u2019s always about getting it right. I just echo what Jay says.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","That\u2019s fine. And thank you but again, I just asked the question. This quarter seemed to slow a little bit, the competition was \u2013 I think you talked about some good guys and bad guys, I was very, was obviously a good news and then there were some environmental. Is there anything that we can infer from the lower PI favorable development and the lower personal lines favorable development that we should look at as a forward leading indicator or is the process still the same and should we look back over the average and make our own conclusions?","Jay Benet","Well we try to give you as much information as we can with regard to what the drivers of favorable development are. So in the case of PI, do you think about the first quarter, a lot of it dealt with weather related losses both CAT and non-CAT and we had some additional non-CAT weather related losses that turned out to be more favorable. And business insurance, you just mentioned of the level of favorable development was 25, but that was after the environmental.","So if you just look at the numbers, you\u2019ve got a storyline that over the last many years has provided insight as to what are the drivers of it and we\u2019ll see just how those drivers, or others, manifest themselves moving forward, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s more that we have to offer that relates to that. We try to be pretty transparent, very transparent.","Gabriella Nawi","Very good, that will conclude our calls today.

The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.","Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.","One final note before I turn it over to Alan, as a result of recent SEC insurance industry guidance relating to the use of terminology, what we previously referred to as operating income, we now refer to as core income. As we explained in the press release, we have also relabeled related terms. To be clear, this is a wording change, and there were no changes in the calculation of these amounts.","And now Alan.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported core income of $614 million and core return on equity of 10.8%, both of which are impacted by $226 million of after-tax catastrophe losses. About half of those losses arose out of storms occurring in the last 2 weeks of March. That kind of weather volatility is certainly in our playbook, but we'd normally expect it a few weeks later in the second quarter.","To give you some context, according to the National Weather Service, reported hale, tornado and wind activity in the quarter was almost 2.5 times higher than the 5-year average. The quarter also had 12 PCS wind and hail cat events, an all-time record for Q1. That surpasses the record that was set just last year. As sometimes happens in this business, the weather in the quarter obscures what was otherwise a very good start to the year.","Our underlying combined ratio was strong at 91.7%. Importantly, our Personal Auto bodily injury losses were within expectations and the same is generally true for loss trends across all our businesses. In addition to underlying underwriting profitability, we were also pleased with our investment results this quarter with net investment income increasing 9% over the prior year quarter.","Turning to production. For all our business segments, we were pleased with our execution in the marketplace, including the record level of premium we wrote in the quarter. In our Commercial businesses, the markets in which we operate remain stable. We continue to achieve historically high levels of retention of 85% in domestic business insurance and 88% in Bond & Specialty Insurance. Renewal rate change improved somewhat over recent quarters, and as always, what's important is the texture underneath the headline numbers. For example, in our core Middle Market business, renewal rate change improved more than 1 point compared to the first quarter of last year. And during the current quarter, Middle Market renewal rate change was positive on 59% of our accounts compared to 53% of our accounts in the prior year quarter. This is the result of our efforts to seek rate selectively and thoughtfully to meet our return objectives in light of the persistently low interest rate environment and the fact that rate change has been below loss trend for a few years now.","It's a similar story in our Management Liability business. Contrast that to our Select business, where rate change has been positive and stable for 3 quarters but modestly below where it was a year ago. Given the returns in this portfolio, we were comfortable with the renewal rate change and pleased to see retention in new business levels up, both sequentially and year-over-year.","In Personal Insurance, we are encouraged that so far we have been successful in implementing the pricing and underwriting actions that we discussed with you last quarter to improve profitability in our Auto business. And we were very pleased to have maintained momentum in growing our profitable Homeowners business. All in for the company, net written premiums were up 5% compared to the prior year quarter.","Brian will take you to the production data and top line results in more detail, but I'll note that, to a very large degree, the growth reflects a combination of higher levels of retention and higher renewal rate change. That speaks to the quality of the premium growth.","During the quarter, we were pleased to have announced our agreement to acquire Simply Business, a technology company and a leading digital provider of insurance to small businesses in the United Kingdom. In addition to a number of immediate benefits, like a profitable and growing business in the U.K. and access to talent with leading expertise in digital commerce in our industry, this is a medium- and long-term strategic transaction for us. It's about building important capabilities. It's digital R&D that will give us important insights into serving our customers and working more efficiently with our distribution partners. It's about making sure that we're positioned to serve the customer however, whenever and from wherever they choose to engage with us. We would have undertaken to develop these capabilities in any event and teaming up with the company and people that have been at it for over a decade and that are leading the way, gives us an important head start.","Our agreement to acquire Simply Business is an example of our investing thoughtfully and strategically in the business, building on the meaningful competitive advantages that have enabled us to deliver industry-leading returns over time. And just as we have for more than a decade, we'll make investments like that for the long term and continue to right size capital by returning excess capital to our shareholders. There's no change in our capital management philosophy. While Jay Benet will have more to say about our capital management, I'm pleased to report that as a reflection of confidence in our business, today our Board of Directors declared a 7.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.72 per share. This marks the 13th consecutive year of dividend increases. Our board also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases.","So wrapping up, weather was a factor this quarter. But the underlying results of the business were strong, we're well positioned for continued success over the near term, and we're excited about the investments we're making for sustained success over time.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay.","Jay Benet","Thanks, Alan. Core income was $614 million, down from 698 million in the prior year quarter and core ROE was 10.8%, down from 12.5%. There were several moving pieces this quarter, so let me spend a few minutes providing you with some further insight into these numbers.","I'll start by saying that the absolute levels as well as the reductions in core income and core ROE were not driven by underlying performance, rather they reflected the relatively high level of tornado hail that Alan discussed, along with the impact of the so-called Ogden rate adjustment, the U.K. Ministry of Justice's decision to reduce the discount rate applied to lump sum bodily injury payouts from a plus 2.5% to minus 0.75%.","Beginning with underwriting, Cat losses were $226 million after tax, $19 million higher than the already high $207 million after tax in the prior year quarter. Page 4 of the webcast provides an analysis as to how our first quarter results compared to analyst estimates and, as best as we can tell, analyst estimates for cat losses appear to be significantly lower than what actually occurred, which more than accounts for the difference. Net favorable prior year reserve development, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly, was 44 million after tax, which was $75 million less than the prior year quarter, mostly due to Ogden.","While remaining strong, as evidenced by a 91.7% underlying combined ratio, our underlying underwriting gain was lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to two things. The first was normal fluctuations in non-cat weather and other loss activity. And the second, as we had anticipate it, was the timing impact of Personal Auto bodily injury loss estimates that were consistent with the higher loss trends that we had recognized in the second half of 2016. Partially offsetting these reductions in the underlying underwriting gain, but not impacting the combined ratio, was a $39 million tax benefit from successfully closing out our federal income tax exams for 2013 and '14.","Turning to investment results, which was strong. Net investment income of $480 million after tax increased by 9% or $41 million as compared to the prior year quarter. Non fixed income NII increased by $59 million after tax, primarily due to strong private equity returns more than offsetting the fully anticipated $17 million after tax decrease in fixed income NII that was driven by the continued low interest rate environment. Consolidated net favorable prior year development was $81 million pretax, driven almost entirely by Business and International as compared to $180 million pretax in the prior year quarter. The quarter included the previously announced reserve increase of $62 million pretax that resulted from the Ogden rate change. Since this reserve increase primarily related to our public liability and commercial auto liability lines of business in the U.K., approximately two thirds of which are in runoff, any impact of this Ogden rate change on our future operating results is expected to be insignificant. Excluding the impact of Ogden, Business and International had net favorable reserve development of $133 million pretax, up from $93 million pretax in the prior year quarter and driven once again by better than expected loss experienced in Workers' Comp and General Liability.","Bond & Specialty had net favorable development of $10 million pretax, while Personal Insurance had no prior year reserve development, which was an improvement from the unfavorable development we experienced in the two most recent quarters. On a combined stat Schedule P basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development this quarter.","Operating cash flows of $775 million remain very strong and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $2.1 billion, up from $1.7 billion at year end 2016 and higher than normal for us. This increase in holding company liquidity resulted from moving the excess capital that was generated by our highly profitable fourth quarter 2016 from our operating companies to the holding company, coupled with our decision to moderate share repurchases in first quarter 2017 to provide financing flexibility for our pending acquisition of Simply Business. As Alan said, there was no change in our capital management strategy.","In the coming weeks, taking into account then current capital market conditions, we'll finalize our financing plans for Simply Business, which will likely include some combination of debt and internal resources. And once we've made that determination, we'll return remaining excess capital to our shareholders. All of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $1.3 billion pretax or $0.8 billion after tax, up from $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $84.51 and adjusted book value per share of $81.56 increased 2% and 1%, respectively, from the beginning of the year.","We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $476 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $190 million and repurchased $286 million of our common shares this quarter, including $225 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy and $61 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Alan said, the board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.67 to $0.72 per share and authorized an additional $5 billion in share repurchases.","With that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.","Brian MacLean","Thanks, Jay. Starting with this quarter's results in Business and International Insurance. Segment income was $468 million, with a combined ratio of 96.3%, a strong result even with the impacts of above-average catastrophe losses and the $51 million after tax related to the Ogden rate adjustment. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development, was 94.5%, up a little more than a point compared to the first quarter of 2016, due to normal quarterly variability in weather related and other loss activity, along with loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing. Net written premiums for the quarter of over $4 billion, a record level, were up 3% year-over-year. Domestic Business Insurance premiums were up 2.5 points, driven by strong production results in Select and Middle Market. International net written premiums were up 6%, due primarily to the timing of certain adjustments in the first quarter of both years.","Turning to Domestic Production. Our focus continues to be on retaining our business. And accordingly, we were pleased that retention for the quarter of 85% remained at historically high levels. Renewal premium change came in at 2.8 points, up 0.5 point from the fourth quarter of 2016 and included positive renewal rate change of about 0.5. New business was $532 million, down from a very strong prior year quarter.","Looking at the individual businesses. Beginning with Select, where we continue to make product and technology investments to drive growth. And we're pleased with the progress we're making as evidenced by this quarter's production statistics. Retention of 83% has remained at historically high levels for three consecutive quarters. Renewal premium change was over five points and new business premiums of $121 million was the highest level since the first quarter of 2012.","In Middle Market, our results reflect a continued stable marketplace. Retention of 88% was at historically high levels, while renewal premium change was nearly three points and included about a point of renewal rate change. Our new business writings continued to reflect our underwriting standards and return objectives, and although down from last year, were in line with our expectations. The combination of strong retention, positive RPC and solid new business levels resulted in meaningful premium growth during the quarter.","In Other Business Insurance, renewal premium change was up slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 with renewal rate change that was flat. Retention came in at 79% and new business premiums were $121 million. In International, production was also very strong in the quarter. Retention improved to 84%, while renewal premium change was slightly positive and new business volumes are strong. So all in for the segment, it was a good start to 2017.","I'll now turn to Bond & Specialty Insurance, where segment income for the quarter of $129 million was strong, though down somewhat from the prior year driven by a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by the segment's portion of the tax item that Jay mentioned earlier. The underlying combined ratio of 81.1% was very strong and unchanged from the prior year. As to the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were up slightly for both Surety and Management Liability. In our Management Liability business, we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best performing accounts, while writing new business in return adequate product segments. So we couldn't be more pleased that retention for the quarter again came in at historically high levels at 88%, while we continued to add a substantial level of new business.","Renewal premium change of 4.4 points was up from recent quarters, reflecting a modest increase in average policy duration along with improvement in the rate component of RPC.","Shifting from the financials, I'd like to comment on 2 things that we did in the quarter to advance our product offerings. First, we added to our expertise in Surety by bringing on board Family Business Institute, a specialist in strategic planning services for closely held construction businesses. We also entered into an agreement with Symantec Corp. to provide our cyber policy holders with leading cyber risk services. These actions will allow us to deliver additional value-added services to our customers, further enhancing our industry-leading product portfolio. So Bond & Specialty results remain terrific, and we continue to feel great about the segment's performance and our position in the market.","Turning to Personal Insurance. Net written premiums for the segment grew 12% in the quarter, with a combined ratio of just under 100%. As you've already heard, there was a historically high level of tornado hail activity in the quarter. And as a result, catastrophe losses of 10 points were significantly higher than our expectations. Excluding the impact of cats, the underlying combined ratio of 89.5% was in line with our expectations. Weather aside, both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners got off to a good start toward achieving the goals we laid out in the fourth quarter earnings call.","The Agency Auto combined ratio for the quarter was 101.1%, and consistent with the segment, the cat component was larger than we would normally expect in the first quarter, with catastrophe losses accounting for 2.5 points. The underlying combined ratio came in at 98.6%. Excluding cats, first quarter auto loss experience was in line with our expectations. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, the underlying combined ratio is up 4.6 points. As you can see on Page 18 of the webcast, 3.2 points of the increase was due to the timing of the higher run rate of bodily injury losses that we recognized in the second half of 2016 and that Jay mentioned earlier. The remaining 1.5 points was primarily due to the additional impact of tenure, which resulted from the earning-in of the increased levels of new business that we wrote last year. As we explained a couple of quarters ago, while the higher level of new business is creating loss ratio pressure in the short term, we believe it is a good thing for the long-term economic value of the portfolio.","As we mentioned last quarter, in response to the higher bodily injury loss levels, we're taking actions to improve profitability, and our primary response is to improve the pricing of the book. Renewal premium change ticked up in the quarter to 5.9%, reflecting some of the impact of rate changes that have been approved thus far. As additional rate filings are approved and impact policies at the renewal date, we expect RPC to increase sequentially each quarter, likely approaching double digits in the third quarter. The rate of TIF growth both sequentially and year-over-year, slowed modestly in the quarter. While within the quarter, the monthly rate of growth decelerated, reflecting our efforts to manage growth while profitability improves. As we said last quarter, it will take time for the actions we're implementing to fully earn into the portfolio, but the first quarter results are on track with our expectations.","Turning to Agency Homeowners and Other, we believe the quarter's results once again reinforced the value of providing portfolio solutions. In a quarter when our combined ratio included 19 points of cat losses, more than double our expectation, we still posted a 96.7% combined ratio. The underlying combined of 77.6% was a little more than 1 point higher than the first quarter of 2016, due primarily to higher levels of non-cat weather. Importantly, net written premium and policies in force both grew at an accelerating rate in the quarter despite moderation in the growth rates for Auto. The 4% growth in net written premiums was the strongest result since 2011. We said in recent quarters that it was important for us to maintain focus on generating growth in our Homeowners book, and we feel good about the results so far in 2017. So for the segment as a whole, we're encouraged by our first quarter results.","Before I turn it over to Gabby, I'd like to comment on a change in the reporting of our segment results going forward. Effective April 1, 2017, the company's results will be reported in 3 business segments: Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance. With this change, the company's international businesses, which were previously reported in total within the Business and International segment, will now be disaggregated amongst these 3 newly aligned business segments. This change doesn't reflect the shift in strategy. Given the progress that we've achieved within our international businesses, we believe that the newly aligned segments will allow us to more effectively engage the product capabilities and talent across both our domestic and international operations.","With that, let me turn it back to Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. We're ready to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie. Please proceed.","Amit Kumar","Two questions, the first question is, I guess, going back to the discussion on the Personal Auto book, you talked about the higher underlying loss ratio, which is not a surprise. I'm curious, how should we think about that loss ratio, either stabilizing at the current level or ticking up or down going forward based on the market environment.","Michael Klein","This is Michael Klein. So in terms of the underlying, you see the 3.2 points on Page 18. When we talked about that last quarter, we talked about the fact that the full year impact of that in 2016 was about 3.5 points. The fact that 3.2 versus 3.5, there's some quarterly fluctuation in what that number will be quarter to quarter, but underlying coming into the year, we've got a 3.5 point gap that as we talked about last quarter we're working to close. The amount to which that starts to get reduced will, again, as we talked about, sort of earn in over 18 to 24 months as the rate comes through. So there's a couple of things going on there. There's the rate that we're taking that will eventually eat into that 3.5 points, but there's certainly an unfavorable year over year comparison for the first three quarters of this year because we don't have the full 3.5 points recognized till you get to the basis of the full year 2016.","Amit Kumar","Okay. The other question I had and this is switching gears on I guess, the broader reserve releases and some other questions we've gotten from investors have obviously focused on the lower level of reserve releases. Bond & Specialty was higher in Q1 2016 due to the AOI experience back in 2016. I'm curious, was that sort of a one off benefit we got in Q1 2016? And hence, we should be careful how we think about reserve releases going forward. Or am I over thinking the meaningful decline in reserve releases this quarter?","Jay Benet","Hi. This is Jay Benet. Let me start by saying what we always remind people of. That is, that every quarter, we're looking at, literally, all the reserves, doing lots of analysis and when there's an indication that the reserves needs to change, we make those changes. So we always try to get and always get our best estimate of what those reserves are on a quarter by quarter basis. We've seen things take place in all of the segments that in different quarters have led to mostly favorable development, although we did have a little unfavorable development in Personal Insurance last year. So I don't look at the reserves and try to predict anything in terms of patterns, in terms of intent, in terms of how things are going to emerge. I think of it more as episodic, and that we had large -- larger reserve development in Bond & Specialty last year versus a smaller amount this year. I just look at, that's just what the data said, and we'll see what the data brings in subsequent quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of a Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed.","Jay Gelb","For Personal Auto, I was a little surprised at the persistent high level of policy in force growth at 12%, given the efforts to fix profitability there, can you give us a bit more insight on that?","Michael Klein","Sure, Jay. This is Michael Klein. So the one thing I would point out about policy in force growth, particularly if you're looking at that 12% year on year number, is that's really a lagging indicator of growth. So think of the 12% as the 12 month weighted average of the growth we've seen over the last 12 months, right? It's this year's policy in force in the quarter relative to the first quarter of last year. So there's built into that 12% number, primarily is the growth we saw last year. That said, Brian mentioned growth decelerated within the quarter. So what you'll see as you look forward and what we expect is that annual policy in force growth number will come down, but it will come down relatively slowly, again, because of sort of the embedded volume already in the back half of 2016. To Brian's comments about growth decelerating in the quarter, we've seen and you can look at it in the production statistics, a bit of a drop in renewal retention in response to the rate. But also importantly, we're essentially where we expected to be. We continue to see win rates come down as we put rate into the marketplace. And then equally importantly, we talked about at bats last quarter, the efforts we've undertaken to take underwriting action and manage the flow of quote volume into the business have started to take hold, and so where it's actually seeing our quote activity and our win rates come down consistent with expectation and the growth continue to moderate.","Alan Schnitzer","Jay, it's Alan. I would just emphasize what Michael said that we were generally able to achieve what we wanted to achieve, and we generally are where we expected to be. So a quarter past, what we talked to you about last quarter, so far so good.","Jay Gelb","I appreciate that. And then my follow-up is on the buyback and how the Simply Business acquisition affected that. So in the Q, it says the Simply Business acquisition was total consideration of around $490 million. I thought an acquisition of that size might not have slowed the pace of buybacks in the quarter. And I'm just trying to think about what the implications are for buybacks going forward.","Jay Benet","Yes. Jay, this is Jay. The way we manage capital, as you recall, we're preserving capital for organic growth in our business and for any kind of activity that would add to shareholder value over time. So what we looked at here was a relatively modest acquisition, given the size of Travelers. But it does impact the resource space that we have. So in this particular case, what we've decided to do in the first quarter was just hold back a little bit on share repurchases. We know we have an obligation that this thing will close later in the year. We never rely on capital markets being favorable or open or whatever. We take a very conservative look. So all we've done is held back some funds to be able to unequivocally close on the transaction. As we said before, as we get closer to finalizing our financing plans for it, which will be a combination of debt and some of the internal capital, we'll make a final determination as to what the capital level should be, and then return the remaining excess. So I wouldn't look into it as anything other than some cash planning on our part, and no change whatsoever in the whole capital management strategy in the place.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of a Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Sarah DeWitt","Could you talk about what you're seeing in terms of loss trends in Business Insurance? Do you expect any upward pressure there? I know last quarter, you talked a little bit about how the propensity to litigate in Auto had spread to Small Commercial.","Alan Schnitzer","Sarah, good morning. It's Alan. I would say, broadly speaking, we haven't seen any significant changes in loss trend in really any of our commercial businesses. And I think you mentioned propensity to litigate. That's not exactly right. What we've seen is a little bit of an increase in attorney representation. And that, actually, we're typically seeing it at smaller less complex cases. So not necessarily increased litigation, just a factor that takes longer to settle the cases and sometimes results in ordering more medical diagnostics, things like that. That's impacting severity. But that's actually not new. We've been seeing that manifest itself on our commercial businesses probably over a couple of years. But I would say, broadly speaking, Sarah, no real change in what's been a pretty favorable loss trend environment. Now in terms of the way we think about that and price and set reserves, we always assume things will return to longer-term normal, but I would say, maybe with the exception of Auto that's been persistently difficult, really no change.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great. And then in Business Insurance, you've been taking modest renewal rate increases for the past 2 quarters, but you mentioned it's still below loss trends. What would need to happen for you to take rates to keep up with loss trends?","Alan Schnitzer","Well, first of all, we'd have to keep going. And I guess I'd step back, Sarah, and I would say that what we were able to do in the quarter reflects what we were trying to do in the quarter. It was very small, very thoughtful, very subtle shifts, and it's just a reflection of what we thought we needed to do, given what's happened to interest rates and where pricing has been relative to loss trends over a couple of years now. And so we were really encouraged by what we were able to accomplish, and we'll see where that goes in the future. I would point out that we've told you in Business Insurance broadly, loss trends about 4%. Rate would not need to get to 4% in order to be flat because, as we've said before, there's real economic impact from incremental exposure that we're getting. And there's other levers we can pull to improve profitability. And we've talked about those before, terms and conditions, mix, expenses, claims handling, other strategic investments. So all those things add up, Sarah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. ","Kai Pan","First question to follow up on the Personal Auto side. The 140-basis-point deterioration, it's, if you're excluding the reinstate, reestimates, that's assuming mostly coming from the new business drag or tenure impact. If your TIF growth is gradually slowing down, is that impact will drag on for a little bit longer?","Michael Klein","Sure, Kai, this is Michael. Couple of comments and one, just to remind everybody, there is also seasonality in the overall underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance. So the 98.6% for the first quarter is reflective of, generally speaking, a lower underlying loss ratio in the first quarter than for the balance of the year. So I just wanted to clarify that point. In terms of the 1.5 or so drag from tenure, you're right, that will mitigate over time. But remember that it's not just the new business we've just recently written. It's the cohorts of business we've written over the last couple of years, earning their way through the book. So as we've talked about in the past, the reduction in the tenure impact is something that we measure in years, not quarters. So it will take a while for that to roll off.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. My follow-up question is on Simply Business. So Alan, I just wonder, could you explore a little bit about the strategic rationale behind it? And why do you do that in the U.K. rather than do that in the U.S.? And do you expect to expand that platform in the U.S. market, because you have a dominant, kind of like a leading position in Small Business Insurance here?","Alan Schnitzer","Sure, Kai. Good morning. Thanks for the question. We've been thinking about everything changing in the world for a long time. And clearly, one of the things changing most significantly and maybe poised to have the biggest impact on us is the world becoming more digital and more mobile. And so every aspect of our business has to get more digital and more mobile. And so that's the way we engage with our customers, the way we engage with our agents. We've got to be there when and however they want. It's the way we manufacture our products and underwrite our risks. It's the way we market our products. It's the way we manage our internal operations. It's about creating a better experience really for all of our constituencies, internally and externally. We've got to be faster, we've got to be more efficient and we've got to be more flexible.","So we look around the world, and we think how are we going to develop those capabilities? And we've got two choices: we can develop it internally or we can see who's great at it, and see if we can bring that expertise in-house. And so you scan the world, and we see Simply Business. They've been a hugely successful customer-focused technology company for a dozen years. So it's not a startup. They've been at this a long time, and they've got a real demonstrated success in this. They've got technological capabilities, they've got know-how, a winning approach to innovation, all things that we think that we'll benefit from. And so we were going to develop these capabilities as I said, one way or another, and it turns out that we thought that the best solution for finding those capabilities and bringing them in-house in terms of where they resided, a great cultural fit, and who we actually think the market leader is, it was Simply Business and they happen to be in the UK That fits nicely with us. We've got a business in the UK We've got a very small budding direct Small Commercial business there. Fits nicely. And even before we had started conversations with Simply Business, they had made a decision to bring their model to the United States. So that's even before early stage. I would say that's just getting started. But our ability to help them accelerate that in the U.S., I think was really attractive to them and the capabilities they bring to us is attractive to us. So it started in the UK, and we'll bring it to the U.S. and potentially other geographies.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of a Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.","Paul Newsome","I'm curious about the change in the International business. Could you -- in one sense, you said that the strategy isn't changing, but it sounds like there is some change going on there, either from a who's in charge kind of position or something else that would drive the segment change. Could you just give us a little bit more color on what actually is changing from a business perspective as opposed to a reporting perspective?","Alan Schnitzer","It really is a way -- it's -- this is completely born out of the way that we plan to manage the business and really, it's the opportunity we think we have to leverage our terrific know-how and capabilities in the U.S. to deliver those capabilities outside of the U.S. It's really -- not that that's not significant, but it's nothing more significant than that. It's not a different approach the way we think about the opportunity outside the U.S., it's just a different approach to how we think we can best deliver our capabilities. And we've been on a journey for eight or so years now in trying to invest in and improve our international businesses. We've invested in technology, we've invested in talent, we've -- we're running a better railroad, and we've had a lot of success. And so the leadership that's brought us there will continue to be actively involved in managing those businesses as a portfolio. We'll have an ongoing obligation to manage those companies on a standalone basis, because we've got regulated entities in the various countries, and we'll continue to do that with the great leadership that has always done that. But we've got an opportunity with the talent and the capabilities in the U.S. to just do a better job of leveraging that outside of the U.S.","Jon Newsome","But there's nobody is there an actually a change in who reports to who or anything like that in those segments?","Alan Schnitzer","Well, it's -- we've always had a matrix reporting structure, and we'll continue to have a matrix reporting structure of the international business and our the people that run the countries will continue to report to Kevin Smith, and he'll have responsibility for that. But beneath that organizational alignment, we'll look at Greg Toczydlowski for Business Insurance and Tom Kunkel for Bond & Specialty and Michael Klein for Personal Insurance, and they will, on a matrix basis, manage their product delivery outside the United States. It's not it's actually not that different than the way we've thought about it all along. It's just an opportunity to reinforce the engagement on a product level.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of a Randy Binner with FBR. Please proceed.","Randy Binner","I had a follow up to Amit's question earlier. And the question is, how are actual severity trends developing relative to the assumption you made, call it, late last year? And if there's commentary on frequency as well, this is in Auto, of course. I'm just wondering, yes, I know that you are re-pricing against elevated trend, but anecdotally, we all observe, I think kind of continued challenges in auto accident frequency and severity. So the question is, how is the actual loss environment developing relative to that re-pricing assumption that started late last year?","Michael Klein","Yes. So Randy, it's Michael. The actual development is consistent with the re-pricing assumptions, whether that's the 3.5 points of elevated bodily injury losses that are now in the underlying or whether it's the elevated level of loss trend that we talked to you about in the fourth quarter that we added to our pricing. So as we sit here today, the experience in the first quarter of 2017 developed consistent with those expectations. The only thing I just want to add a point back to the question from Kai, and I think it was implied in my answer, but the 1.5 of tenure impact that we're talking about year on year is year on year, and therefore, that's not the full amount of tenure impact, right? There's -- there was tenure impact in the base in 2016, the 1.5 point is an additional 1.5 point on top of that, just to clarify. But to your question, the experience thus far this year has been consistent with both the elevated starting point and the elevated trend that we factored into our expectations.","Randy Binner","Okay, great. And then, I guess, the follow up there is understanding that and understanding the price that you're moving, you're putting into the market. Do you see Travelers as an auto insurance company that's going to gain market share because of the dislocation out there with some of the mutual's really having to push very high pricing? Or do you see yourself kind of in the middle or potentially losing market share as we see market share dislocation in U.S. auto insurance?","Michael Klein","Sure. So just a couple of points. First of all, in 2016, we gained share ever so slightly, 0.1 point based on the growth that we experienced last year. Certainly, coming into this quarter, you see the TIF growth at 12%, you see the period to period TIF growth at 2%. We would view in the first quarter, our growth probably outpacing the market. That said, our objective is to improve profitability and manage growth. So our the glide path we're trying to move the business down is one to reduce the growth rate but continue to grow as we manage profitability. What that amounts to in terms of market share really depends on what happens with the other players in the marketplace. We would tell you that the pricing actions that we're putting into market, again, consistent with our view of the loss trends being environmental, we're not alone in terms of driving rate. But what that ultimately amounts to in terms of share, we'll have to wait and see.","Alan Schnitzer","And Randy, we don't really manage to market share, we manage to returns, profitability, balancing that with growth, and market share will fall out of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","First question, I was hoping to get some additional color on your outlook for the Business Insurance pricing environment. In the Q, you guys point to the renewal premium change basically being consistent with the Q1 for the balance of the year. So I mean, how do you view kind of pricing compared to expectations or any changes in the U.S. economy when you came to that outlook for the RPC?","Alan Schnitzer","So Elyse, RPC obviously includes rate and exposure. And so it's a broader measure, and there's obviously a corridor around the words \"broadly consistent.\" And so we're probably not going to break that down into pure rate and exposure. Obviously, we thought we needed to get more pure rate in the first quarter. And as I said, we were encouraged, we were able to do that. I will say that the trends that lead us to do that, namely a lower interest rate environment and where rate has been for a while relative to loss trends, those trends still persist out there, and so we'll have to take that into account. And so we'll take it from there. Obviously, we operate in a competitive marketplace, and so that will be a factor. So we're encouraged and then we'll see where it goes.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you. And then just a couple of numbers question and going back to the Personal Auto book. If I look at your underlying loss ratio this Q1 compared to the adjusted last year, it seems like there's about 2.5 points of deterioration. You guys said year-over-year the delta was about 1.5 points that changed from tenure. So what else am I missing when I look at that calculation, since it's adjusted with the elevated trends last Q1? And a second-part question in terms of the auto margins, your expense ratio in the Personal Auto book came down in the fourth quarter, and then also with that, that kind of lower level this quarter. How do you think about the expense ratio for the Auto book when you think about your margin outlook for that business for the balance of 2017?","Michael Klein","Yes. So Elyse, it's Michael, to your point I'll start with expense ratio. We continue to manage expenses on a pretty disciplined basis inside PI, and we're enjoying the benefit of the increased volume over relatively flat expense base. And that continues to be our plan going forward. In terms of the other components of loss ratio, it's really normal period-to-period fluctuation. There's nothing -- there's some puts and takes underneath that, but it's really normal period-to-period fluctuation has explained those other changes in the underlying.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of a Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Ryan Tunis","I guess my first one was just a follow up on Alan's comments about -- in Domestic, the positive rate indication this quarter on 59% of the book versus 53% a year ago. And I guess, just thinking a little bit more granularly, what is leading to the upward rate indication? Is there pressure on certain accounts? Or is it, I think the point you made just several years of rate running below loss cost trend?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, good morning, Ryan. So we manage the business on a very granular level with a return objective in mind. And we had a bunch of years going back to 2010 or '11, where we had a rising rate environment and that put us in a very good position in terms of where our earned and written returns were. And since, I don't know, beginning of 2014 or so, we've been in an environment where rate's been below loss trend, and we've had low, continued low interest rate environment. I think the 10-year this morning was slightly over 2.2% or something like that. And so over time those things have an impact.","And while today, we're satisfied with our [written] returns, we look out the windshield into the future and see where things are going, and it causes us to, again, very selectively, very thoughtfully in a way that we think makes sense, given our portfolio, our returns, working with our distribution partners in a way that's never intended to be disruptive to them or our customers. We try to improve the return outlook. And not everywhere, I made the point, in our Select business was in a different position from our return perspective. And we were happy to take the rate where it was, where it's been over recent quarters, and so it's just very granular execution with the return objective in mind.","Ryan Tunis","That's helpful. And then, I guess, just following up on the line of questioning in Auto. I guess thinking about weather in Q1, it seemed like January, February, weather was somewhat benign. You had warmer temperatures. I'm wondering if, how you characterize the impact of weather on Auto in 1Q in the first quarter. I think the way to ask it is, how did frequency trend year-over-year?","Michael Klein","Yes, again, I would say, broadly speaking, frequency and severity in the first quarter came in consistent with our expectation. I think, we talk about the impact of the weather, and we'll talk about warm temperatures, above freezing in cold months, can give you sometimes higher speeds and higher severity. Cold temperatures below freezing will give you ice and will give you more high frequency, low severity bumping into things. But you see those period-to-period fluctuations, and again, that's part of my point in the response to Elyse, is we got just normal period-to-period fluctuations, but we didn't see anything in the first quarter significantly different than our expectations.","Brian MacLean","Well, and specifically, this is Brian. When you think of the first quarter cat activity, it's the tornado hail and specifically the hail that is driving the numbers. And that is usually the case. So especially in Auto, hail will bring about an immediate uptick. And that's what we saw in March, as Alan pointed out.","Ryan Tunis","Got it. So maybe over March, weather normalized some. Okay.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of a Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed. ","Lawrence Greenberg","Just staying on Auto, are you seeing anything new in how you think about the long-term value of the business that you put on in the last couple of few years, probably undeniable that you'd, like to have repriced some of that a little bit earlier. But are you seeing anything new that would support or refute that this is business that you ultimately want and will be value enhancing over the long term?","Brian MacLean","No, Larry, we're not. I mean, as we've talked about over the past several quarters, we're slicing and dicing it 18 ways to Sunday. But from a quality perspective, the quality of the business, the profile of the business is very consistent with what we targeted when we designed and developed and launched the Quantum Auto 2.0 product. Again, the profile of the business coming in doors is consistent with what we've been looking for. We continue to evaluate and examine that tenure impact and make sure that the business is tenuring consistent with our expectations.","And so to your point from a long-term economic value perspective, it's tracking with our expectations. Again, we would have liked to have charged more for it, but that is really the primary conclusion. And that's why the strategy to improve the profitability is to go after it with base rate.","Alan Schnitzer","And to the extent that we do keep it and improve profitability from an economic perspective, it'll be a good thing in terms of creating economic value.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of a Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith","A couple of quick questions here. First, Brian, Alan, can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics right now in the Workers' Compensation insurance area? The premiums are down a little bit the last couple of quarters. And are you seeing any impact in the marketplace from, perhaps a competitor having some issues?","Brian MacLean","Yes. So thanks, Brian. And I always preface our comments with we feel great about our Workers' Comp capabilities. We clearly feel we're the industry leader. We've got, between our underwritten book and our service book, the largest portfolio in the industry. So we know the line well. We know the difficulty there can be with any long-tail line and more than any business we have, incredibly granular, industry-by-industry, state-by-state, account-size-by-account-size. So we look at that a lot. Yes, pricing is -- so directionally, there is definitely good news on the loss trend side, now it's a very long tail line of business. So short-term movements in loss trend get blended in as we look at long-tail loss trend.","But loss trends have been positive, but pricing is reacting and probably overreacting to that in the marketplace. So we're looking at it very closely. There has been some disruption with carriers out there in the market, and we are looking at that business closely. It's still got to meet the economic hurdles that we have in the profitability, so to the extent that there are opportunities out there that we think we can write at appropriately prices, and we're excited about it. But we'll look into that closely.","Brian Meredith","Okay. Great. And then, next question, I'm just curious in the Management Liability area. What are you seeing with loss trends there?","Alan Schnitzer","Nothing significant. There's been a lot written about securities class actions being up and the numbers may be up. I would say as it relates to us, we've got a very diversified Management Liability book. We manage positions in the tower and limits very carefully. And the activity that we've seen that's been at elevated levels is in industries where we're under-weighted. It's been biotech, pharma, health care, and we're under-weighted there.","I'd also add that as you look at that commentary out there that suggests that numbers of security class actions are up, sometimes the methodology in counting the cases distorts the numbers. You've got to look at cases that were previously brought in state court that are now being brought in federal court for reasons you'd have to ask a plaintiff's bar about, but you really have to look at the aggregate of those two numbers to see the trends in claim counts.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of a Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Jay Cohen","Most of my questions have been answered. But just one question. When you look at the difference in the renewal rate change versus the renewal premium change, that difference is much bigger in Select than it is for the broader Commercial or Business Insurance segment. And I'm wondering why that is. Why is there a bigger difference in Select?","Gregory Toczydlowski","Hey, Jay, this is Greg Toczydlowski. In the Select business, just given the smaller nature of those policies, we have a certain segment of the business that we call Express business and the CMP or the BOP portion has some inflationary guards inside there. So that's automatically applied, typically to the property line, so underneath the CMP or the BOP product. So that's one of the drivers. The other one is around Workers' Comp. Workers' Comp, we continue to see the type of mix that we're writing, some wage increases and some increases in payroll. So the combination of the two has really given us that exposure lift that we're getting in that business.","Jay Cohen","And Workers' Comp then is a bigger piece of the Select business than it is of the overall segments business?","Gregory Toczydlowski","Is the question as a percentage of the overall premium? It's got a similar mix profile, if that's the question.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Meyer Shields","Very briefly, when you talk about reallocating the international business to the individual segments, can you talk broadly about what impact that would have on the reported underlying combined ratios?","Brian MacLean","Just procedurally, one of the things we're in the process of doing is reconstituting the 10-K information as well as the supplement. So just in line with your question, we'll be providing this kind of data to you in advance of the webcast for the second quarter. We expect late in the second quarter to get the information out into the public. But I think when you look at the overall size of the various segments versus the size of the international operations, I think the impact on the combined ratios will generally be pretty modest.","Alan Schnitzer","And just to state the obvious, when you look at the consolidated number for prior periods, there will be no change, right? It'll be modest reallocation among the segments, but relatively small impact.","Meyer Shields","Right. No, that makes sense. And then, the Simply Business acquisition, where are we going to see those earnings in the segments and then in the income statement?","Jay Benet","Simply Business, will be part we expect it to be part of the Business Insurance segment. So it'll be there, but we'll see how we'll present that. I mean, it'll be part of the segment, it'll be wrapped in. But again, and just in terms of the size of the Business Insurance segment, Simply Business will be a pretty small piece of that.","Gabriella Nawi","Excellent. That concludes our call for today.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available on the Investor section on our website. And now Jay Fishman.","Jay S. Fishman","Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased that we posted solid results in the fourth quarter with net income per share at $1.51 and return on equity of 10%. The story for the full year, of course, was the remarkable weather. Weather losses were far and away the worse in our history, and as a consequence, net earnings per share of $3.36 for the year were considerably lower than what we've become accustomed to. Nevertheless, we price our product for the long term, and of course, we don't control the weather. There will be years such as 2006 and '07 in which weather losses are surprisingly low, and of course, there will be years, but hopefully not too many, in which losses will be high. ","Also a less financially significant, but nonetheless important piece of the 2011 story was the persistent low fixed-income investment environment. A 1.5 years ago, in the middle of 2010, we made the important decision that we were going to actively take steps in terms of rate terms and conditions to improve future returns in light of the insurance pricing environment and our view that it was increasingly likely that we would be facing low fixed-income yields for some time to come. We increased those efforts in the middle of 2011 in recognition of the possibility that weather patterns might be changing prospectively for the worst, particularly given the active weather we experienced in 2010 and into the first half of 2011. ","We've shared with you before that we are just not big believers in magic market cycles. We understand that our business is about one underwriter and one agent discussing one account at a time. But we believe that our franchise were strong enough that we could seek improved profitability through improved rate terms and conditions without adverse effect to our business. And 18 months later, we have proven that to be the case in most of our commercial businesses. We take these actions selectively where analytics suggest they are warranted, and we try very hard never to be disruptive to our agents or insureds. In our judgment, the success we've experienced speaks to the value that we bring to agents and customers and the success we've had positions the company very well going into 2012. In particular, Business Insurance, excluding National Accounts, had a pure renewal rate gain of more than 6% for the quarter and 8% for December. As a result, given our current view of loss trends, we anticipate widening of the underlying underwriting margins in Business Insurance in the first half of 2012. ","In Personal Insurance, the regulatory environment is such that while the progress we've made is important, the real evidence of success remains ahead of us as we continue to roll out the pricing and underwriting changes that we have decided to pursue. But I want to emphasize that the steps we are taking are not limited to rate. There are a number of levers available to us in addition to rate as we pursue improved returns. It include underwriting actions, particularly with respect to risk selection and location, as well as changing underwriting standards with respect to roofs and loss history in Personal Insurance. We've always been attentive to our expense base and we continue to be very thoughtful in that regard. ","Our commitment to improving perspective returns in Personal Insurance is no less than that which we had in Business Insurance when we began this program 18 months ago. Every personalized franchise is unique. Every company's agent group is different, and importantly, the value proposition to the insureds is quite different company to company. We believe that we will be successful given our agents, our insureds and the value that we bring. So while the bottom line financial results this year were less than we would hoped, we couldn't be more pleased and more proud of our people when we look at the progress we've made to achieve improved returns, particularly given the difficult environment that continues to confront the U.S. economy. ","We have really demonstrate the value of the Travelers franchise to agents and insureds as well as the strength and diversity of the business that has allowed us to achieve all that we have over the past 18 months. We ran the business for the long term and focus on returns over time. We're also pleased and proud that since 2005, we've generated an average annual upgrade and return on equity of 13%. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay S. Benet","Thanks, Jay. Let me begin by stating that we have maintained our strong cash position, ending the year with holding company liquidity of $2.4 billion. Operating cash flow is $351 million for the quarter, which included unusually high claim payments that resulted from this year's severe weather and $150 million payment to our qualified pension plan that even in this very low interest environment kept our funding level close to 90%. And consistent with an ongoing capital management strategy, we continue to return excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.2 billion of our common stock, which was at the top of our previously announced range and paid $166 million in dividends, bringing year-to-date common stock repurchases to $2.9 billion and year-to-date dividends to $669 million. As was the case this quarter, there have been many periods during the past several years in which our share repurchase and dividends significantly exceeded our earnings. We achieved this by diligently and systematically identifying opportunities to free up capital, returning that freed-up capital to our shareholders. ","After several years of working at it, the process of freeing up capital is now largely complete so we now expect the future common share repurchases will be driven more by future earnings levels, taking into account capital needed for business growth and corporate needs such as death service and pension obligations. Having said that, we remain fully committed to identifying and returning excess capital shareholders, whatever the source. ","I'd also like to point out that all of our capital ratios remain at or better than target levels at the end of the year. Net unrealized investment gains increased by $337 million during the quarter to $4.4 billion pretax or almost $2.9 billion after tax and book value per share rose to $62.32, a 7% increase since the beginning of the year. So now let me turn the microphone over to Brian to go through the results in more detail.","Brian W. MacLean","Thanks, Jay. I'll start with Business Insurance, and the real news in this segment is that the rate on the business we are writing is up significantly in the last 6 months and is now meaningfully exceeding our current view of loss trend. ","Renewal premium change of 8% for the quarter included pure rate increases of over 6%. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter that Business Insurance has seen positive rate change on renewed accounts, and as with recent quarters, rate increase across all product lines, with the largest increases in workers' comp and auto. We are very pleased that the months within the quarter continue to show sequential improvement in pricing with December renewal premium change of 10% and pure rate increase of 8% for the segment. And based on our preliminary look at January business, pure rate gain looks pretty similar to what we achieved in December. ","Net written premiums were up year-over-year, driven by pricing gains and positive audit premiums. Retention and new business levels were solid, though down somewhat from recent quarters. As we mentioned last quarter, execution on our pricing strategy may impact business volumes going forward, and so far we continue to remain very comfortable with a balance between improved pricing and volume. ","Through 2011, this has been a very easy call. I want to emphasize here that when we speak about pricing strategy, our goal is not simply to increase the price on every account. It's a very granular approach based on analytics where we're looking for the appropriate price for the individual risk or the class of business. It's never been a one-size-fits-all approach. ","Turning to losses. Overall loss trend was relatively benign. In workers\u2019 comp, we saw some higher-than-expected frequency from 2010. In commercial auto, 2009 and 2010 bodily injury and 2011 physical damage losses were above our initial expectation. So some movement in loss trend concentrated in the 2010 accident year, but more than offset by increased prices. ","In summary, we feel extremely positive about the results in Business Insurance. And in our current pricing levels, we believe that we will be generating underlying underwriting margin expansion beginning in the first half of 2012. ","In the Financial, Professional & international Insurance segment, operating income of $152 million for the quarter was very strong and consistent with the prior year quarter. This caps a very good year for the segment with full year earnings up more than 4% over what was a good 2010 result. ","In surety, we continue to see strong margins and slightly less volume driven by sluggishness in construction spending. We could not be more pleased that we've been able to maintain our current position as the market leader in this business during a very challenging economic environment without a meaningful increase in losses. That we have done so speaks volumes about our ability to select risks, the credit quality of this business and our approach of running this business for the long term. ","Looking at management liability. This remains a line of business where market pricing continues to be challenged, but less so at the smaller end, which is the source of most of our premium. While our pricing here has lagged most of our other businesses, we were able to achieve positive renewal premium change for the second quarter in a row. This is reflective of favorable production results in our private and non-profit business and is due in part to benefits from recent technology investments. ","In international, net written premiums were down quarter-over-quarter due primarily to the timing of a few small reinsurance transactions and our exit from the personal lines of business in Ireland. Over the past several years, we have increased our focus on our international operations, and we are pleased with the progress to date. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in the underlying loss ratio more than offset the increase in the expense ratio, which is a good sign that the investment is paying off. ","In Personal Insurance. Looking at auto profitability, the story is essentially the same as discussed for commercial auto. We've seen a moderate increase from expectations in bodily injury severity for the most recent accident years and the higher-than-anticipated level of claim frequency in severity in the physical damage coverages for the 2011 accident year. The quarter-over-quarter impact of these items both from prior year and 2011 prior quarters was almost 6 combined ratio points. Because of this volatility and the normal seasonality in the quarter, we think a better way to focus on the run rate of the business is to look at the full year combined ratio, which after adjusting for cats and prior-year development, was 99.5. This includes 1 point directly attributable to higher non-cat weather-related losses. And so 98.5 is our view of the current run rate, which is only 2 to 3 points higher than the combined ratio required to get us back to our historical target return. As Jay mentioned, we are committed to improving returns in this product in 2012 by aggressively pursuing rate and implementing local underwriting strategies. ","In Homeowners and Other, profits were once again down in the quarter due primarily to adverse weather. Although, the impact of the weather in the fourth quarter was dramatically less than in recent quarters, it was still slightly higher than expectations, driven by the unusual northeast October snowstorm. In addition, we did have some increased claim activity in the non-cat weather from earlier in the year. ","As we have said many times, we obviously don't know what the weather will be in 2012, but given the experience of the last several years, we are managing the business with the expectation that weather losses may continue to run above longer term historical averages. Accordingly, we are taking a broad-based assertive approach to managing the property product, which includes not only executing local pricing strategies but also seeking to tighten underwriting standards and changes in terms and conditions. ","As examples, we are underwriting for age and quality of roof, re-assessing how we factor in the number and type of previous claims and implementing higher minimum deductibles for weather and non-weather claims. Additionally, we are changing a small portion of our re-insurance program to create a structure that better responds to higher frequency, lower severity events. So we are taking a lot of actions in homeowners and are confident that these actions will further enhance the long-term profitability of our industry-leading franchise. ","Turning to production. For both Agency Auto and Property, renewal premium changed and retention remains strong while new business continues to trend down slightly as we accelerate our pricing, underwriting and terms and conditions action. With that, I'll open it up to.","Gabriella Nawi","Carlos, you can open it up for Q&A now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, ma'am. Ma'am would you like me to read the Q&A instructions now?","Gabriella Nawi","No. It's okay. You can open -- you can open it up to questions now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Ma'am, would you like me to go to the first question?","Gabriella Nawi","Yes, please.","Operator","And the first question comes from the line of Keith Walsh with Citi.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Couple of questions. First, Business Insurance. You've alluded to in the press release the underwriting margin, it looked like it would potentially improve in the first half of '12. Is this more optimistic than what you guys talked about last quarter where you seem to be a lot more adamant that this would take time to earn in over the next 12 months? And then I've got a follow-up.","Jay S. Fishman","Well, Keith, this is Jay. The rate that we earned -- the rate that we wrote -- I'm sorry, the rate we wrote in the fourth quarter was obviously at a higher level than that which we wrote in the third quarter. So going into 2012, as we look out into 2012 as it earns, we are not more optimistic because that implies an attitude. This is fact. The fact is, the rate in the fourth quarter was higher than the rate in the third. So wherever we were in the third quarter with respect to margins, we're better off today, and it will simply take the time to earn that written premium into earn. So I'd say that it's not a matter of optimism, meaning feeling, it's really a matter of arithmetic and fact. We're in a better position today than we were at the end of the third quarter with respect to the speed with which those margins will expand, and assuming that we continue to earn rate at this level, the effect that it will have in the margin arena.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just sticking with Business Insurance. Obviously, the rates are good, but let's focus on the other part of the game here. I guess, the retention in new business which are both pretty -- down pretty sharply on the new business side, especially. So what are the dynamics of not just the accounts you're keeping, which we can see in the rate, but what about the accounts you are losing? What's really going on there? If you could talk about new business hit rate. Thanks.","Jay S. Fishman","First, I would disagree categorically with your characterization of this down sharply. The retention in Business Insurance for the fourth quarter was at 81%...","Jay S. Benet","79%.","Jay S. Fishman","I'm sorry. 79%. 79% was commercial. 79%. In the context of thinking about business long term, that's still an exceptionally high retention rate. I mean, we've gotten used to rates in those mid-80s that, frankly, we've never ever seen before. If you go back to the period in the late '90s and early 2000s and middle market retention, we struggled to get it above a number that started with a 7. So what's happening on the Business Insurance side is really -- it's just fine. This is an easy trade-off. The one segment of the business where retention has been lower than others has been in the larger end of Select, right? You may recall that we define Select as the smallest end, which is highly technological. And then there's Express Plus, which is the larger end of Select. That category remains a more challenging pricing environment. It has to do with the way we think that regionals compete and how they view middle market pricing. They don't have the technology to really compete effectively at the low end of small commercial. They don't have the infrastructure to compete effectively at the true middle market business that we define, so they tend to land in that larger end segment. We've established our own thresholds for return expectations, and to the extent that we can capture business that meets those return thresholds, we'll take it, and to the extent somebody else decides they want to take it away from us at a lower price, that's just fine. We're -- so far, this has gone better than I think any of us would have expected 18 months ago. And the trade-off at this point between return gains and retentions, as we described it, is losses. It's just fine. What was the 81%? The 81% was...","Brian W. MacLean","81% was Commercial Accounts...","Jay S. Fishman","Commercial accounts, yes...","Brian W. MacLean","Overall -- this is Brian. Overall in retention, x the high end of Select, we are right around 80%, a little bit north of 80%, and we feel great about that. On the new business front, we're going to look at business in the marketplace and if we can find stuff that meets our return thresholds, we're going to write it. And in this environment, we're not going to search below that.","Jay S. Fishman","I'd make other observation -- and it's more challenging for us in quantify it and demonstrate it, but we have indicators that will support what I'm about to say. New business pricing is also better than it was. It's part of the measure because you simply don't have the prior-year expiring premium to compare it, but we are comparing new business pricing against the manual rate that we construct. And when you look at that pattern, there are 2 things that are really encouraging. One is that there's clearly lift going on. And two, that the gap between -- and I'm not speaking necessarily about this particular quarter, but looking at it over a longer period of time here, 6 , 8 months, the gap between renewal and new has narrowed. And so both of those things give us a pretty good sense of confidence that the pricing for new business is lifting as well. Can't quite quantify it with the level of precision that we can renewal, but we feel awfully good about it.","Brian W. MacLean","The one comment last comment I'd make on new is that our flow is still very solid. So if this was a matter of we weren't getting opportunity to quote on business and we weren't quoting, we'd be a lot more concerned with that. So we feel good about the flow, we feel good about our activity in the marketplace and profitably levels will be where they will be.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions, both related to pricing. Can you talk about your desire in 2012 to continue to push for rate on the commercial side? Because obviously, you've achieved a certain amount of rate already. Is that desire still very much in place? Or will you be satisfied now where the priced ROEs are and you don't need to push as much? That's question number one. And then secondly, if you could describe the dialogue you're having with agents and brokers. Obviously, your effort is to improve profitability, improve returns, theirs is to do the best for their clients. How much pushback or are you getting from the agents and have you sensed a change in that pushback?","Jay S. Fishman","Jay, I'll take on the first one. No, our strategy now remains as is. We're going to continue to do this selectively, thoughtfully targeted, but we are going to continue. And our goal -- we get asked all the time, \"What's the target?\" We don't have one. And that's partially because some of the conditions that we're responding to were just not as clear to us as they might be. I'm speaking specifically about weather. I'm speaking about investment returns. And so we're going to try and drive our products and our returns back to the historical kind of broad-based targets. We still have a mid-teens ROE as a -- long term. We talked about it over time, but we still very much have that as a long-term target. We are most certainly, from an individual pricing basis, this is important now, I'm not speaking about the return on equity in the whole place, I'm getting very granular with you in talking about the returns on allocated capital of individual products based upon the rate that we have in place today and our immediate view of loss trend. We are getting closer. We are making real progress in getting back to the levels that will ultimately convert it to mid-teens ROE on a GAAP basis. So we got some to go yet but we are encouraged and we're going to keep driving until we find whether we can or not get back to our historical kind of return thresholds. So that's, I think, the answer with what does 2012 feel like from a strategic and tactical perspective. [indiscernible] Bill Cunningham to talk about the agent arena.","William E. Cunningham","Good morning. I would say on overall basis, we look at our agent relationships as very strong partnerships and as being a strong partner, not surprising them is critical. So being upfront early in the process with our agent in terms of what we're doing on an overall basis, but more importantly, as Brian mentioned, this is not a one-size-fits-all. So every account communicated to the agent as early in the process as possible because our ultimate goal is together, to be out with the client, explaining why we need a given rate increase on a given transaction. At the same time, we do -- from time to time, agents feel a need to test where we're coming from, so they give them time to do that. But I would tell you on an overall basis, it has been very positive in terms of the feedback we received and how we've handled it. And so again, partnership early in the process, no surprises, together sitting down with the customer whenever possible and not putting them in a position where their back is against the wall is key to our partnership.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of questions here for you. First, going back to the auto insurance results that you're seeing in the quarter. When you talked about the 98.5 and need to get it down to a 96, I guess, the question I have there is, one, kind of what are you doing to get it down there? Is it just pure rate? And is the market kind of receptive of the type of rate that you need to get it back down to those 96 levels? And then I have one follow-up.","Greg Toczydlowski","Brian, these is Greg Toczydlowski. In terms of the auto strategy, predominantly, a rate strategy that we're focused on automobile. When Jay and Brian talked about all the other levers that we're looking at from an underwriting in terms of conditions, we're focused a little more on the property side of the house with that. So we're monitoring our competitive position all the time and given the regulatory environment that we live in, it takes a little bit of time before we can get that rate grow, but we're feeling that we're continuing to see good flow and good retention numbers and we'll continue looking at that as we go forward with the business.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But obviously, if you're writing at a 98.5, 99, that's not your kind of an acceptable return level. They can't get a double-digit ROE off of that, right?","Greg Toczydlowski","That is correct. We are shooting closer to that combined ratio that you threw off [ph] in 96 and we're going to be doing that through pricing.","Jay S. Fishman","And some of the dynamics, Brian, that we've been experiencing we suspect are more broad-based. This is just one. But it's -- some unusual -- the pattern has developed with the slowdown of the new automobile business generally. Price of used cars has risen. If the price of used cars has risen, what's been interesting is the number of accidents that result in total losses, where the car produces salvage, have actually gone down. The car relative value up. Auto repair cost much less so more cars are being put back on the road. And a consequence, we've seen of that is an increase in sheet metal cost. I'm not talking about new sheet metal. I'm speaking now about replacement parts. And that's not unique to us. That's going to be a condition that's going to affect lots of people. Now it may impact us a tad more because we tend to write more comprehensive coverage than some other carriers do, so we may be on a more extreme side of that. But the kinds of things that we're seeing are not things that -- it's very important, are not things that indicate problems with underwriting or risk selection. They are more episodic issues with respect to specific costs that are not, I would say, unique to us . So our hope is, and of course, we are going to find out, that we can go to the market and drive the kinds of rate increases that will bring this back, just like we did in Business Insurance. We started extremely slowly. We started 18 months ago asking fundamentally if our folks can get 1 point. That's what we said. Let's see if we can get 1 point, and we've built on that every month. We're going to take that same systematic, thoughtful and patient approach to auto insurance and homeowners and see what progress we can make.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then question for Brian. When you mentioned pure rate also up 8%, can you define that? Is that just rate less cost inflation?","Brian W. MacLean","No. When we say pure rate, we're looking at the components of the premium change.","Jay S. Benet","No exposure.","Brian W. MacLean","So it's the rate charged per -- exposure on that, on the average renewal.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And then how would that compare to what loss cost inflation kind of looks like in the quarter?","Brian W. MacLean","We don't peg the exact number, but we've said we're meaningfully exceeding it.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. Excellent. And then just lastly, Interest rate assumption when you're talking about getting rate, getting close to your kind of historical kind of double-digit ROE targets, what are you thinking about the interest rate environment?","Jay S. Fishman","Mechanics on that are that all new money is discounted at the current yield curve, basically, where we invest money today, and the surplus embedded in the business in that calculation is a more historical element premised on the fact that we have surplus that rolls off from old products and then comes on to support new. But importantly, we're not kidding ourselves the investment return. That's all new money at all new -- at current yield curve today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question is on pricing. We've seen pricing and workers compensation and commercial auto up sharply because of high loss cost trends. Curious about what are trends you've seen in pricing and other lines that you're pushing this year versus last year?","Brian W. MacLean","So a couple of just clarifications on that. The comp and the auto, we have the strongest rate improvement. It's not just because we're seeing -- or it's not because we're seeing sharp increases in loss cost there. Obviously, pricing always has something to do with the loss cost trend, but it's not a sharp increase. We saw a fairly significant increase of a couple of points, really, on almost every single line of business we write. So this isn't an example where comp is spiking up dramatically. Auto's up a lot and everything else is kind of flat. I would say every line in the commercial space is moving comp and auto more dramatically, but it's not completely out of pattern with everything else.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Are you talking about rate?","Brian W. MacLean","Rate. I'm talking about rate change.","Jay S. Fishman","And as Brian reminds all of us, and you as well. In many of our lines of business. It's very much a state-by-state story. There tends to be this view that it's one national rate. It's not. There are states where either frequency or severity underlying trends are either more concerning or less concerning than others. So our reaction with respect to rate and what we're trying to accomplish is very much driven by the state environment, specific to that particular risk.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. That's helpful. As a follow-up, what is the impact of non-cat to weather for all the segments? I believe for the personal lines, it was 2 years for the full year.","Brian W. MacLean","Non-cat weather? I'm looking at Greg. Non-cat weather in PI for the full year. Can we disclose that level of granularity, I guess, is the question.","Greg Toczydlowski","It's not something that we've disclosed previously. We obviously have some view of it, but the substance of that answer is functionally dependent upon whether our assumption of normal weather is right or wrong or high or low. So rather than trying to get into a debate of how much was non-cat weather, we just -- that's just -- it's internal, and I'm not sure the data is all that meaningful.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And just one last thing, if I may, what -- to what amount of rate increase do you think on the personal auto line do you think will be necessary for you to get to your level of profitability that you're targeting?","Jay S. Benet","Well, the arithmetic is actually pretty simple. In Personal Insurance, if we want to drive the combined ratio down by 2 points, we got to get about 3 points of rate above and beyond what we otherwise would, because we are obviously in effect, I'd say, always getting rate. That's not universally true. But fundamentally, it's a business where the renewal price change has always been positive. I can't recall that it ever went to a [indiscernible]...","Gabriella Nawi","Up 2 to 3 points.","Jay S. Benet","So that's really the dynamic of kind of 3 points of rate above and beyond we would otherwise get, and under the presumption that loss trend stays about where it is. So there's an all other things being equal dynamic. But the answer to that is it's not as far away as it might otherwise see. Now the marketplace will have to say whatever it wants to say and we're obviously aware of that. And our influence, our market consequence, our breadth in Business Insurance is I think one of the attributes that's enabled us to accomplish what we did in PI whether -- we'll see whether that same dynamic holds true in personal in the same way. But it's just not that far off.","Brian W. MacLean","Just jumping back to his first question because we have answered part of this in the past, so on the non-cat weather. I mean, we said last quarter in Business Insurance, and it's still probably about the right number, is there's a point in the combined ratio of variance above a normal non-cat weather number for the year. I said -- in the quarter, it was pretty flat in BI, but for the year, it' still about 1 point. In auto personal lines, I said there was a point of clearly identifiable non-cat weather it might actually be more in auto. And the Whole number, I don't remember off the top of my head.","Greg Toczydlowski","They are going to go on a same basis. Full year property would be closer to 2 to 3 points.","Brian W. MacLean","Variance from a non-cat weather.","Jay S. Fishman","From whatever we [indiscernible] coming back to the notion of...","Brian W. MacLean","Whatever was normally our view of normal and weather always been.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two questions for you. The first is on the share buyback pace for 2012. Should we be thinking about buybacks being equal to net income, operating earnings, retained earnings, can you just clarify?","Brian W. MacLean","Well, what we were trying to say was, it should be looked at based on earnings, so not retained earnings for sure. And then net income versus operating income, they are both income and they have tended to be relatively similar. So we think mostly in terms of operating income but if they were large realized gains or something, we would take that into account as well, but that would be more episodic.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I just want to confirm. And then what's the sort of maximum comfort level on debt to capital x the unrealized gains?","Jay S. Benet","We've talked in the past about -- for AA company like us it's being in the 15% to 25% range. We are at a little over 23%. Part of the 23% is actually driven by prefunding $250 million of debt that's going to mature in 2012. So that's worth about 7 basis points in that calculation. But being within that range is a very comfortable place for us.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. And then the final one is on the non-fixed income, after-tax earnings, it was down in 4Q versus 3Q. I'm just try to figure out what you feel would be a reasonable run rate heading into this year.","William H. Heyman","Jay, Bill Heyman. For what it's worth, the quarter came in just about exactly where we thought the quarter would come in on October 1 as we look to the matrix of factors which affect returns in the non-fixed income portfolio. I suspect the best way to make predictions about the future is to look at the bar graph. Back a few years, try to draw a mean, I figured that's about what we'll make because if we couldn't make that, we probably wouldn't maintain the portfolio. For what it's worth, there were no real surprises in the fourth quarter. This was about what we expected.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So if I look at that over the past couple of years, probably averaging around $50 million to $65 million a quarter?","Bill Malugen","I'd have to look at the bar graph. I think on the low side of that.","Jay S. Benet","This is Jay. It's one of those things, as you know, it's really difficult to predict. So whatever you put in your model, there is a level of uncertainty. We have great visibility into the fixed-income part of the portfolio but this is going to be so dependent upon what the economy does.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to dig into the workers comp line for a bit, just get some color on the market, and I guess, more specifically, one of your competitors in Hartford has had -- has had some trouble -- some emerging troubles grow through 2011 in that line. Some other cracks are appearing from other competition. I know you don't believe in the cycle but what are you seeing specifically in that line? How do they manage their books of business different? And why are you so confident that this won't begin to have some issues into '12 and beyond?","Jay S. Fishman","Let me talk for a second about -- in a little more specific, what we're seeing. I'm not going to comment on how other companies might be managing their business but we can talk certainly about how we manage ours. So just to be clear on workers comp, what we saw this year, in the aggregate, continues to be a pretty strong picture for us. So if you look at the prior years, '02 through '09, every year continued to perform better than we had expected. So positive in every one of those years. In 2010, we did see...","Jay S. Fishman","Bill said to me yesterday, and make sure you still believe this, that if you look back to '02, the current expected loss outcome in each of the year '02 through '09 is currently lower than the original estimate at the time we made it.","Jay S. Benet","Better. Lower loss ratio, better result, right.","Jay S. Fishman","'02 through '09. So in 2010, we did see some continuation of the increase in late reported claims that we discussed in the second quarter. And we believe this is really a direct result of the impact of the great recession on workers comp claim reporting patterns. And so the 2010 year was out of pattern. But overall, all years, including 2010, we continue to have positive development on our overall workers comp book. The impact of all of that is fully reflected in not just 2010, but rolled into how we look at 2011 and what we booked there. And most importantly, is completely rolled into our pricing the products today. And given the pricing improvements that we've gotten, we feel good about the returns and the profitability levels of the comp business we're writing today. Now as Bill said before, it's a state-by-state game and very, very granularly managed.","Jay S. Fishman","And I've got a couple of other facts that I think would be helpful. First, the magnitude of the 2010, I'll call it, excess claim activity, to put a number on it, it was under $100 million after-tax. That's the -- that's the magnitude of that change. And again, what we see -- everything that we see tells us that those were occurring to dates, incidents in '10 that didn't manifest themselves until 2011. That's an unusual dynamic and something we haven't seen before. Maybe it's a function of the economy and how people feel about job security and whether they raise their hands or not. And again to Brian's point, we've rolled that forward into the 2011 loss estimate, book that fully and are currently incorporating that into our 2012 estimate for pricing and reserving. And this is -- I think it's important because it will, again, help quantify it. The combination of the rate gains and the loss trends and the positives and negatives and everything else, our estimate of that allocated return on capital measure that we use to measure the profitability of the products in workers\u2019 comp all-in now is low double digits. It's low double digits. So it's, I think, it's helpful to put a perspective on what we saw. Now our view on that 2010 development is that it's more, I'll call it timing rather than a permanent change. And of course, we'll see whether that's the case or not. To get back to your other question about -- and of course, you all know this, you're sophisticated analyst, you get it. The issue of how one company reports versus another. The critical element in all this is what did the company generally assumed? And so whatever experience we have in the loss arena is sort of one thing. But what original assumptions were made is a critical element in determining the embedded health of the business and I'd come back to the \u201802 to '09 period as at least indicative of the way we view the line. Importantly, severity remains as expected, that's an important element so the actual inflation dynamic there is not an issue. And lastly, and again, this just speaks to the mechanics of the business, and I think the integrity of the process here, the delta, the change that we had assumed from the '10 into the '11 year, that turned out to be a good -- at least so far, remains a good assumption. The base of your [indiscernible] change some, but the delta into '11 that we had anticipated turned out to be, at least, so far consistent. So a tiny bit of a complicated story but you've got all the news.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple questions here. One thing you haven't talked about for a little while is the direct initiative. You mentioned and it looked like in the release about 80 basis points on a combined ratio, which something about $0.30 a share, if my math is right. Clearly, more significant than it was as a percentage of earnings when you launched it. Just kind of what do you look at in the development of that business to let you know that you're creating value and that you're hitting your objective so that it eventually starts to bring in earnings as opposed create that pressure? And just one follow-up.","Jay S. Fishman","I'll let Doreen and Greg answer as well, but I picked -- the one element that we continue to work on from an operational dynamic is we're getting pretty good at getting people through the quote process and getting quotes out. And our next step is to do better. Next step, we're working on more than anything else right now is to do better in converting those quotes into actual sales. And it's not immediately apparent to us that it's a function of price, although, it won't surprise any of you. If you listen to all the ads, the comment is those who switched saved whatever the number is, $400. No great shock. $400, no great shock if you quote someone $400 more than they're currently paid, the likelihood of switching is actually pretty low. So to comment, price is not an insignificant element there. We have a -- I don't know exactly what to call it, but we have a conversion curve. We know -- relative to at least what the customer discloses to us, their current prices is, we know how far, either plus or minus to that mark, we -- in a large number of accounts, how close we need to be to convert. But we've got more work to do in the conversion process so that the dollars that we're spending in the media -- and we're not spending nearly what anyone else and the big players, but to maximize that investment, just to get more of the quotes converted into sales. So that's our dynamic. Some of it is, we suspect, I'll say, reputational. I think there are other companies that have, as a result of doing this for years, found a reputation for being less expensive. Whether that's true or not is a whole other question, but they've seen to have earned a reputation for it. And we have to continue to build a reputation dynamic around the value proposition that we give. We're never going to be great at selling half a coverage sandwich, which $6. We're not comfortable selling half the sandwich for $3.10. That's just certainly not that who we are culturally. We're much more comfortable providing customers with the coverage they need rather than the dynamic of how much they can afford. That's just not us. So we're going to keep working at this and we got our fingers crossed, but we're well on our way.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just a little bit more on workers comp. Just the premium line was pretty bumpy during the year. I'm just curious. Is that a result of pure seasonality? Is that a result of maybe some change in the competitive dynamic or just the market itself or any strategic change on your end?","Brian W. MacLean","It's actually more just pricing and audit premium running through the numbers. So a decent piece of that is movement of the underlying exposure of the accounts and what payrolls have been and how those have moved up. And especially when compared to a year ago when many comp accounts had some fairly significant return premium dynamic. So you're going from a return premium environment to an audit premium plus environment, and that's probably the biggest single driver of the movement in that line.","Jay S. Fishman","And from our perspective, it's a good thing.","Doreen Spadorcia","Yes.","Brian W. MacLean","Oh, yes, that's definitely true.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So it's not initially a policy count, it's more of a exposure per unit?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes.","Jay S. Fishman","Payrolls. The initial premium is based on an estimate. We're coming down the road. When the policy expires, we do an audit. If the actual payroll was less than had originally been disclosed to us, then we have a return on premium if the payroll turns out to be more than what it was originally disclosed to us, we have an additional billing during the sort of depths of that great recession we were in the return of premium arena as customers shed payrolls far more aggressively than they have anticipated they would. And now they reached the stage where they were flattening out. That brought the audit premium back to 0, and have been growing modestly. And so what we're seeing again is now a change into the build arena of audit premium.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I mean, any change in the competitive dynamic just over a year, just in the larger case market that you've noticed?","William E. Cunningham","This is Bill Cunningham. Nothing discernible. I mean, in a large national...","Jay S. Fishman","When you say large, let's make sure...","William E. Cunningham","You're talking large national accounts less responsive business?","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Like your commercial accounts business, not the small, not the Select or Select Express, not the small and the commercial but kind of the down-the-middle commercial accounts business.","William E. Cunningham","I would just say over the course of the last 12 months, some of the crack that you've described, and we have seen competitors pushing price and moving price in another direction in a number of states that we compete with them.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank.","Jay S. Fishman","I'm sorry, let me -- before I could take that question, let me just -- because Bill used words that we understand here internally. I think what he was saying -- you should correct me if I'm wrong, but I think what you're saying is when you say cracks, what you're seeing is other competitors struggling with workers comp line and not an insignificant increase in rates by other competitors as well. We never deal with other competitors. We get anecdotal observations from agents. But that's what Bill is speaking about, that we're, particularly, in the states that have been more challenging from a loss trend environment where we see other -- we understand, again, trying to -- we never talk you never talk with other competitors about rates in any way but we see them reaching for rate as well in that environment. That's what our comment was.","Gabriella Nawi","Okay. Next question -- Josh Shanker, question, please.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","During the Goldman Sachs Financial Service Conference Call, you dissuaded investors from taking a look at Schedule P. Obviously, now we're going to look at that. But maybe you know more than we do, and if you can walk the math on why our look Schedule P would lead us to the wrong answers, and maybe if you can talk about what your reserve are going to look like when we do that following all of the 2011 numbers?","Jay S. Fishman","First, I don't think we ever dissuaded anybody from looking at the Schedule P. I just -- go back to that Goldman Sachs conference and we were talking about the complexity of making, I'll call it somewhat simplistic assumptions based upon kind of overall views. But our Schedule P is going to reveal the things that Brian shared with you earlier. You're going to see the 2010 accident year for workers comp had more claim frequency than we originally anticipated. You're going to see, in the auto liability line, particularly, I guess not particularly, but commercial auto for sure is going to see 10, 9 and -- 9 and 10?","Brian W. MacLean","A tiny bit in 8 but mostly 9 and 10.","Jay S. Fishman","9 and 10. And I think those are going to be the things that you'll see that -- and that's why we're providing the explanation here today, so that people understand what it is they'll be looking at when they see it.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then so far from what you're seeing, looking at the beginning of the year of 2011 to where you are today, those things you're seeing in 2010 have sort of reverted to the mean are not showing up this year?","Jay S. Fishman","Well, we booked the change into 2011, first of all. In other words, the base year, what we do, we develop loss estimates for a given year. We started out with the immediate preceding year. We'll make adjustments for frequency and severity that we anticipate. So when 2010 had that $94 million after-tax increase in claim activity that I spoke about, we obviously rolled that forward into our 2011 loss estimate, and that's been booked and recorded. As we look to 2012, we obviously are starting out with the base, again. But now you're asking the complicated question, of that $94 million in that year, how much is a timing difference that we see just from one year to the next, and how much is permanent difference? But we certainly are going into 2012 eyes wide open with respect to the 2010 accident year and what its effect was. That gets me back to my comment earlier that the estimated return on allocated capital for comp broadly speaking. I mean, before [ph] across the whole book is at the moment in the low double-digit range, so it's -- and that's incorporating that 2010 development into that.","Jay S. Benet","And if I could add a couple of things. I mean, there's a story line that you have to follow in our Q's where we're describing things that are taking place each quarter, some of which, as Jay said, impact us as we look at the business going forward. And that's when we talk about base year movement and our adjustments for current year loss picks and ultimate results for a particular year. There are other things that take place that get reflected in Schedule P that don't impact the numbers going forward. So if you look at some of the property line, as an example, what you'll see is disclosure in our 10-Qs talking about some development that's taking place, one that comes to mind were the Arizona hail storms that impacted us from 2010 where we made loss estimates associated with what we have been seeing. And then in 2011, saw a further development on those losses that get reflected in our property lines. Those are losses that are episodic, and therefore, don't impact us when it comes to looking at loss fix. So we say it's complicated, those are the kind of things that we're talking about. The granularity of information that we go through to make a determination, number one, are our reserves fairly stated at the end of the quarter which are at always best estimate. And then two, what do this information tells us about the past as well as the future and then trying to very granularly and thoughtfully build those into our ongoing analysis.","Jay S. Fishman","The important point I think we made the important point on the Goldman Sachs Day was that there seems to be a view somehow that current year reserve adequacy is a function of late. And that concept is just foreign to us. We don't understand it actually. We make estimates of losses and we make those estimates of losses, frequency, severity, and so the notion that we would not be making our best estimate because a couple of years ago, rate was more challenged relative to 5 years ago when it was less challenged. It was just completely foreign to us. We don't get that. So to us, at least, and I'm speaking just for Travelers, the way we establish loss reserves are independent of whatever the rate is, that's being very granularly determined and they are constantly being reviewed by actuaries internally. And you've heard us say, when we make re-adjustments to current year loss picks, current year loss picks, not prior year, it's because we're seeing activity either up or down that was different from what we had originally expected that loss activity to be, so that was the comment. By all means, dig into Scheduled P.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I appreciate, and thank you, very granular answers. Just a quick numbers question. Brian went through the math on personal auto. What is the run rate for this U.S. thing for annual cats per year in the loss ratio, normalized?","Jay S. Fishman","In auto?","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You said you were targeting 96. You got to 98.5, but that doesn't include any normalized cats. So I just want to also get that part. I think, at least, maybe a bit.","Jay S. Fishman","No. That -- go ahead answer the question.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, Josh. It leads us [indiscernible] really insignificant for the auto side and put this in normal expectation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, just to start clarifying. Your 99.5 to 98.5 run rate, was that  Personal Auto Or Personal Insurance?","Brian W. MacLean","That was Personal Auto and the delta is the 1 point of pretty clearly identifiable weather-related activity above that pretty low normal activity.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. I just wanted to make sure I heard that right. And then within FTI, obviously, you've been exiting the personal lines of business in Ireland. You talked about that from a premium standpoint. Just curious whether or not that exit is having any positive impact on the loss ratio, and if so, how much.","Brian W. MacLean","I don't know the exact number. It should have a positive impact, but it will be pretty small.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just kind of timing wise, how far are we -- I mean, my sense is there might be one more quarter of kind of cycling through. Is that right in terms of timing?","Brian W. MacLean","Maybe 2, but I think the overall personal lines of premium in 2011 was about $24 million, $25 million. It's pretty small and should tell us in the next couple of quarters.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, I guess, a bigger question, how customers are adapting to the rate increases? Obviously, we know exposures are up on an underlying basis with the economy. Which puts some purchase -- price pressure, at least dollar spend pressure, on customers who are raising rates on top of that. Are you seeing customers either change the limits they're buying? And I recognize not all your customers may have the flexibility to do so, but are you seeing any change in buying behavior? Either limits, deductibles or other things, clients are dealing to try to mitigate kind of the dollar impact on them?","William E. Cunningham","This is Bill Cunningham. I would say, we're not seeing any meaningful change in the commercial space on terms of conditions either limits or deductibles. Where we are seeing changes in deductibles would be on the larger property end in wind exposed areas, and that would on the margin, but I would say across the board, clients are opting more for the price increase than a deductible increase. But again, that's largely anecdotal. But the numbers would support that it's more about the price and less about the terms and condition.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Then can you just help, on a written basis, connect the dots between what you reported for rate increases, exposure increases in Business Insurance relative to what we're actually seeing show up on the net line in terms of written premium increases? I mean, I get retentions down, but it doesn't seem to be down relative to the positive push from those 2 things to explain kind of the delta.","William E. Cunningham","It's a retention and I would say new business dynamic, the new business being off of it.","Brian W. MacLean","I'm not sure I got the question there, Matt. I'm sorry.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, based on your chart, it looks like you're saying Business Insurance pricing are up 6%. It looks like based on your chart, you're showing exposure growth of somewhere between 2% and 4%, which would make the range 8% to 10%. Retention's down 4%, so that takes that to 4% to 6%. And I get new business is down a little bit but that feels more like 100 bps, so I would net-net expected better growth.","Brian W. MacLean","Okay. So you got audit premium spread. Why don't you...","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That was a positive delta year-on-year too, though.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. Right. So if you're trying to reconcile written premium year-over-year, you've got the rate as a big improvement on a full year basis about 5 points. You got 2.5 points of exposure. You got retention down 5 points plus you've also got new retention business, a change in new business.","Jay S. Fishman","The biggest driver offsetting the price gains is retention in new business the quarter.","Brian W. MacLean","And then you've got audit premium swinging from negative to positives.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe I'll follow up offline because I'm not exactly following.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I appreciate all the colors and disclosure on the reserve issues both in change. And you really substantial disclosures in your third quarter stat filings, which, I think, are better than a lot of your peers. The one question I'd have basically the follow-up on Josh's conversation and all the sort of talking we've done about workers' comp and commercial and personal auto and the challenges there. Recent past couple of quarters have seen a lot of releases from surety, as well as I think disclosures on your third quarter regulatory filings suggests that the asset funds and the liability, so claims made in occurrence, are funding much of the recent reserve favorable development, as well as -- it potentially sound like you're maybe a UA [ph] reclassification. And I think we use the word episodic before, I'm curious, should investors be looking at these as the sorts of things that we should be plugging into our models for next year as favorable offsets to potentially sort of modest favorable development and going forward in the other lines where we're talking about potential challenges?","Jay S. Fishman","This is Jay Benet. We've answered this question a number of times in the past. We, as a management team, have this very, very robust processes each quarter to evaluate, what our reserve changes look like, and to come up with our best estimate of reserves. We have no guidance. We have no views that we would have either internally or to share externally as to how reserves are going to develop. So I think, you, as an analyst, can feel free to think of whatever patterns you've seen, whatever you're hearing from other companies. As Jay said, it's all dependent upon what a company's assumptions are, what the starting point is, what are the loss ratios that they have at this point in time and how things are going to develop. So one company's development can look a lot different than in other companies. But I think you see our history, you see what we've done in terms of putting up reserves in the past, how those reserves have developed. And as I said, our view is we're always at best estimate and you can come up with whatever you view you think is appropriate.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, that's certainly fair and expected, something like that. Just in the context of sureties, obviously, sort of an episodic, credit-related reserve and then the commentary you guys had suggested around the excess coverage, which is related to favorable traditional environment over the past number of years. And we're just wondering if we should look at this as kind of a onetime thing and maybe you've already answer that so...","Jay S. Benet","We're always building in the current view as to how an environment has changed. So if we have certain views of the toward environment, let's say, several years ago that we're driving a certain level of reserves and that sort of environment has improved to date, we'd look at, okay, where is it today and we have some view as to where we think it might go in the future and that would be the basis upon which we reserve. But what we don't do is we don't say, gee there some continuum of improvement. Let's book 1\/4 of it now, we'll book a quarter next quarter, and we'll keep -- and keep going. It's always based on facts and circumstances as they exist and it's the best estimate at that point in time.","Jay S. Benet","And if you go back in time in our disclosures, what you'll see is the description of what's generating positive development, it's changed. It's been this line or the other line or that year in property or liability, or just -- it's a very big business. We're making estimates for multi-billions of dollars of losses every given year and things just workout somewhat differently than we had originally expected. But it's not as if there is a pattern there that somehow is reliable. It's just changed over the years and different line show up at different times. If we had -- as we said at the Goldman Sachs Day, our goal is to get it right. It's not to -- I know it feels good when you have that favorable reserve development in the period that it's reported, but we're pricing product every day. And if we're going to make the most of what we got, either growing our business or recognizing lost trend or adjusting, the only way we're going to make really thoughtful decisions, really good ones, is if we get it right. So that's our goal. Our goal is to get it right. It's obviously better than -- everybody says favorable, better than unfavorable. But -- and maybe that's true at the moment, but when we have favorable development, that means that we over-costed our product in the year in which -- from the year it relates to, and maybe we could have sold more if we had a different view of costs. So we're very driven to try and get it right.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, I think that's right. I personally grew up in business always thinking that the right answer is the right answer, and if they could lead you to better decisions, I think you guys, obviously, sort of do a good job of explaining, but we shouldn't count on these things going forward. And so I don't think there's any issues there. If I could just ask one final numbers question.","Gabriella Nawi","We'd like to move on to the next question. Thanks. We kind of gave you your tip.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Cliff Gallant with KBW.","Cliff Gallant - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just on the investment portfolio. Do you anticipate any changes in strategy? And can you comment on the outlook for the non-fixed income portion of the portfolio, please?","Jay S. Benet","Well, no changes in strategy. We have a strategy, which we think accommodates a very wide range of conditions. In terms of the outlook for the portfolio, am I allowed to give an outlook?","Jay S. Fishman","Well, we sort of did. Someone else had asked, about the non-fixed income...","Jay S. Benet","Well, that was what we expected on an ongoing basis. I think I'm being asked for an outlook for the quarter. So the question is -- I guess, typically, we don't an outlook for the quarter.","Gabriella Nawi","That was it?","Jay S. Fishman","Yes, thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Okay. Well, thank you for joining the call. We appreciate the time given that we went a bit over. But if you have any further questions, please contact myself or Andrew Hersom in the IR department.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 18, 2019.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.","Abbe Goldstein","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers discussion of our first quarter 2019 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investor section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three Segment Presidents, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions.","Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investor section on our website.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our 30,000 employees are engaged in executing on our focus strategic priorities and we're seeing the impacts. As we've explained in the past, our strategic efforts are geared towards creating attractive top line opportunities and improving productivity and efficiency. The strong results we delivered across all our business segments this quarter reflect progress on both fronts.","Net income for the quarter of $796 million was up 19% over the prior year quarter, generating return on equity of 13.5%, the highest level in two years. Core income was $755 million, up 11% and core return on equity was 13%, also the highest level in two years.","The underwriting gain of $395 million pretax is up more than 50% over the prior year quarter, reflecting higher business volumes and a lower combined ratio. Earned premiums were up 5% to a first quarter record of $6.9 billion with each of our business segments contributing. The combined ratio of 93.7% improved by nearly 2 points. The underlying combined ratio improved almost a point to 91.6% with strong results in each of our business segments. Notably, we achieved improvements in productivity and efficiency in each of the segments.","Our high-quality investment portfolio performed well, generating net investment income of $496 million after-tax. While slightly below the results in prior year quarter due to lower private equity returns, net investment income benefited from higher fixed income return.","Our strong results this quarter contributed to growth in book value per share of 7% and growth in adjusted book value per share of 2% after returning $625 million of excess capital to shareholders consistent with our long-standing capital management strategy.","Turning to production, we remain very pleased with the execution of our marketplace strategies. During the quarter, we grew gross written premiums to a record $7.8 billion, an increase of 6%. Net written premiums, which reflect the impact of the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty, we discussed with you last quarter, were $7.1 billion, up 3%. Our premium growth once again reflects high levels of retention and positive renewal premium change. That speaks of the high quality of the business we're putting on the books.","In Business Insurance, gross written premiums increased by 6%, as we achieved renewal premium change of 6%, including renewal rate change of more than 2%. For both rate and RPC, those were the highest levels in almost five years. As you might expect the price increases were led by the Commercial Auto and property lines, but with the exception of Workers' Comp, rate was up both year-over-year and sequentially in each of our product lines. That's the result of granular and deliberate execution to meet our return objectives. We'll continue to see great gains selectively and thoughtfully and in close coordination with our distribution partners. Importantly, we are encouraged that while we were improving margins, we maintained retention at historical highs and generated a higher level of new business.","In our consistently high-performing Bond & Specialty business, gross written premiums were up 4%, driven by historically high levels of both retention and new business in our domestic Management Liability business. Surety premium volume was at high levels in both the current and prior year quarters.","In Personal Insurance, which as you know is a great story, gross written premiums were up 6%, reflecting strong results in both our agency auto and Agency Homeowners businesses. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Tom and Michael about our segment results.","Lastly, I'm pleased to report that as a reflection of confidence in our business, our Board of Directors has declared a 6.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.82 per share, marking 15 consecutive years of dividend increases with a compound annual growth rate of more than 9% over that period.","To sum it up, our first quarter performance has a terrific start to the year. We generated strong results in terms of both profits and returns. On top of that, we had another quarter of excellent production. Our performance, competitive advantages and commitment to innovation position us to continue delivering industry-leading results over time.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.","Daniel Frey","Thank you, Alan. Core income for the first quarter was $755 million, up 11% from $678 million in the prior year quarter. And core ROE was up 13%, up from 11.9%. Earnings per share and core earnings per share were up 24% and 15%, respectively. These improvements resulted from lower catastrophe losses and higher underlying underwriting margins, partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and lower private equity returns.","Pretax underlying underwriting gain, which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD, increased by 16%, driven by improvements in all three segments. Underlying results benefited from higher business volumes and the consolidated underlying combined ratio of 91.6% improved by 0.8 point from the prior year quarter, driven by a lower expense ratio.","Successful execution of our productivity and efficiency initiatives resulted in improved operating leverage as insurance G&A expenses were nearly flat, while net earned premiums grew by 5%. Our first quarter results include $193 million of pretax catastrophe losses, down significantly from $354 million in last year's first quarter. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the first quarter was $51 million pretax, down from $150 million in the prior year quarter.","In Personal Insurance, net favorable PYD of $69 million pretax resulted primarily from better-than-expected performance in auto. In Business Insurance, net unfavorable PYD of $21 million pretax compares to net favorable PYD of $66 million pretax in the prior year quarter. The change primarily resulted from the enactment of the Child Victims Act in New York during the first quarter. This legislation extends the statutory limitations for cases of child sexual abuse, creating potential exposure to claims in the general liability line that were previously time-barred.","Excluding the impact of the New York law change, Business Insurance would have reported net favorable prior year reserve development, workers' comp had net favorable reserve development, Commercial Auto was largely unchanged and commercial multi-parallel had modest net unfavorable reserve development. Pretax net investment income decreased by 3% from the prior year quarter to $582 million, as higher fixed income returns were more than offset by lower returns in our nonfixed income portfolio. Fixed income NII increased by $39 million pretax due to the higher average yield on invested assets and an increase in the amount of average invested assets.","Lower returns in the private equity portfolio reflected the market downturn in the fourth quarter of 2018, as these private equity results are generally reported to us and consequently by us on a quarter lag. As we discussed on our earnings call last quarter, we added a new catastrophe reinsurance treaty for 2019, providing coverage for PCS-designated events for which we incur $5 million or more in losses, above an aggregate retention of $1.3 billion. The cost of this new treaty is reflected in ceded premiums, and that is the primary reason that the growth rate in net written premiums is less than the growth rate in gross written premiums this quarter.","Because the ceded written premium is all recorded up front, this impact will not recur in the remaining quarters of the year. On an earned premium basis, the new reinsurance treaty will affect the results of all four quarters in 2019. Most loss recoveries from this treaty would likely benefit our net cat losses, which are excluded from underlying results.","Based on our assumed weather losses for the year, the treaty would have about 0.5 point adverse impact on the full year underlying combined ratio but a minimal impact on the full year total combined ratio. And we assume that any recoveries would likely only benefit the second half of the year. Of course, the effect on our underlying and total combined ratios for 2019 will be impacted by the level of PCS events we actually experience.","Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $639 million were, again, very strong, all our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion. Holding company liquidity is temporarily elevated as we issued $500 million of 30-year debt at 4.1%, ahead of our upcoming $500 million debt maturity in June.","We took advantage of attractive market rates and issued the new debt in early March. So we're carrying an artificially high level of holding company liquidity exiting the first quarter that will naturally adjust itself before the end of the second quarter.","In terms of the unrealized gain, interest rates decreased during the first quarter. And as a result, we went from a net unrealized investment loss of $113 million after-tax at year-end to $1 billion after-tax unrealized gain as of March 31. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was $89.09 at March 31, 2% higher than at year-end.","We returned $625 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $421 million and dividends of $204 million. And as Alan noted, the Board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.77 per share to $0.82 per share. So across all key measures, we remain pleased with our strong financial position.","And with that, I'll turn the microphone over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.","Gregory Toczydlowski","Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance had a strong first quarter as reflected in our underwriting and production results. As you heard Alan say, both renewal rate change and renewal premium change were at the highest levels in almost five years. Significantly, we achieved that while maintaining a very strong retention levels. And importantly, we also continue to invest in strategic initiatives to position us for the future.","Segment income for the quarter was $414 million, while the combined ratio was 98.1%. The underlying combined ratio of 95% improved by 0.5 point from the prior year quarter, even after the impact on earned premium from the new cat reinsurance treaty. The treaty increased the underlying combined ratio by 0.5 point, split about evenly between the loss ratio and expense ratio.","Let me break the underlying combined ratio down a bit further. The underlying loss ratio was 0.8 point higher than the prior year quarter, driven by about a point of elevated losses in our international business. I'll provide some additional comments on international in just a minute.","In addition, the change in the underlying loss ratio also included a little more than 0.5 point from lower non-cat weather losses, which was mostly offset by the impact of the new cat treaty as well as a little less than 0.5 point from higher Commercial Auto loss estimates consistent with the reestimates we reported in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Auto losses for the quarter were generally in line with our expectations. The underlying expense ratio was favorable to the prior year quarter by 1.3 points, about 0.5 of which was driven by continued growth in premium volumes while maintaining generally flat insurance G&A expense dollars. The other half of the improvement resulted from the benefit this quarter related to a state assessment.","Before I turn to the top line in production, I'll spend a minute more on what we're seeing in our international business. For a couple quarters in a row now, we've shared with you that we've experienced some elevated loss activity. These losses are predominantly property-driven and have come primarily from a small number of large losses into a lesser degree higher attritional losses. We're pursuing meaningful rate increases to address what we believe to be industry-wide challenges. In addition, we're applying risk selection and risk control measures in response to the losses we're seeing and taking targeted actions to exit certain lines and accounts. These measures are well underway, and our production results in these market reflect the progress we're making in our efforts to improve profitability.","Now to the top line. Gross written premiums for the quarter were up 6% over the prior year, reflecting strong production results. We continue to be pleased with the impact that our strategic initiatives are having and creating opportunities for us to grow the top line profitably.","In terms of domestic production, we achieved strong renewal premium change of 6% in the quarter, including renewal rate change of 2.2%. The renewal rate change of 2.2% was up 0.6 point from both the prior year and the fourth quarter, with the Commercial Auto and property lines leading the way. Importantly, at the same time as we achieved these pricing increases, we maintained historically high retentions of 86%. In addition to what you see in RPC, we've also been improving terms and conditions, particularly in our large property business, which improves the risk profile of the book.","New business was a very healthy $564 million. We're pleased with our production results, which reflect our thoughtful balance towards retaining our best business, improving pricing where we need to in order to meet our return objectives and pursuing attractive new business opportunities.","As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change and renewal rate change, both remain consistent with the past several quarters, while retention remained strong at 83%. New business was strong and comparable to the prior year quarter. We're pleased with the returns in this business and the production results reflect our strategic execution.","In Middle Market, renewal premium change was 6% with renewal rate of 2.2%, up 0.7 point from the prior year and 0.6 point from the fourth quarter, while retention remained historically high at 87%. New business premiums of $336 million were up 4% from the prior year quarter. Building on the success from the business centers in Commercial Accounts, we begun to roll out the utilization of the same centers across several of our other Middle Market businesses.","As with Commercial Accounts, the goal is to be more active in the marketplace by creating additional capacity for our field underwriters to partner with our agents and brokers to create more solutions for our customers.","To sum up, a strong start of the year for Business Insurance, and we continue to feel great about our execution in the marketplace.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Kunkel","Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered another quarter of strong results. Segment income was $138 million and both the combined and underlying combined ratios were an excellent 81.1%. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 2%, driven by continued growth in our domestic Management Liability business. Considering the high quality of our Management Liability portfolio, we are pleased that the domestic retention remained high at 89% with renewal premium change up 3.6%. New business continued at historically high levels and up 6% from the prior year quarter.","Surety premiums were strong in both the current and prior year quarters, and we remain well positioned to capitalize on potential increases in public infrastructure investments. So Bond & Specialty results were strong. We feel great about our marketplace execution, competitive advantages and our ability to continue delivering leading returns and profitable growth.","And now, I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.","Michael Klein","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Personal Insurance is off to a great start in 2019, with strong profitability and solid production. Segment income was $278 million, the highest quarterly total in a decade and an improvement of $149 million over the first quarter of 2018. Our combined ratio of 90.1% improved 7.4 points, driven by lower catastrophes, improved underlying underwriting results and higher net favorable prior year reserve development. On an underlying basis, the combined ratio was 89.1%, an improvement of 1.4 points even after an 80 basis point impact from the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty.","Turning the top line. Gross written premiums grew 6%, demonstrating continued momentum in the segment. Net written premiums were up 2% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of the new cat treaty. The impact is more pronounced in Agency Homeowners and other, where net written premiums grew 1% compared to gross written premium growth of 9%. Agency Automobile delivered an impressive quarter with a combined ratio of 89.4%, 5.4 points better than the prior year quarter and the best result in more than 10 years. The quarter benefited from higher net favorable prior year reserve development and very strong underlying results. The underlying combined ratio of 92.1% improved 4.2 points relative to the prior year quarter due primarily to earned pricing exceeding loss trend, including the benefit from continued improvements and observed frequency levels.","Just as a brief reminder, the first quarter underlying auto combined ratio is typically the lowest of the year. We're also very pleased with our first quarter results in Agency Homeowners and other, where our combined ratio improved by more than 10 points from the prior year quarter to 88.2%, driven by lower catastrophes.","On an underlying basis, the combined ratio was a solid 82.6%. The increase of 2.4 points versus the prior year quarter primarily reflects the impact of the new cat treaty. Turning to quarterly production. Agency Automobile retention remained solid at 84% with renewal premium change of 5.1% and a 7% increase in new business from the prior year quarter. We're encouraged by these production results as we work to grow the line at returns that continue to meet our objectives.","Agency Homeowners and other delivered strong production results as well, with retention at 85%, renewal premium change up over 0.5 from the fourth quarter and increased momentum in new business, driven primarily by the successful rollout of Quantum Home 2.0. Our Quantum Home 2.0 product is now available in 25 states versus 3 states at this time last year. We're on track to launch the product in most of the remaining states by year-end, including enhancements like our expanded smart home discount and home sharing endorsement, both of which we've introduced since the initial launch.","To date, the product is performing well both in terms of marketplace reception by agency and customers and in terms of production and profitability. To recap, we're pleased to be off to a great start to the year in Personal Insurance and are well positioned to grow profitably, while continuing to invest in the business.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.","Abbe Goldstein","Thanks, Michael, and thank you. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb","In domestic Business Insurance renewal - the renewal rate change. So it was good to see that, that rate change accelerated in the first quarter and you mentioned that was largely due to Commercial Auto and property with an offset from workers' compensation. We've seen in the past how that's gone up comparatively one quarter versus the prior quarter and then has shifted down over time. Do you think this has momentum to stay at this level or potentially increase? Or do you think this might be more of a onetime boost?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, Jay, it's Alan. If you go back and think about when we started talking about rate most recently beginning of 2017, and we said then we were starting to push for rate. And if you plot out the line for either rate or rate and RPC, you'll see an upward sloping line and that's been very deliberate on our part. I shared in my prepared remarks that we intend to continue to push for renewal rate change and just in terms of managing the returns. Now we are getting some help from exposure and that counts to both in terms of the component of exposure, behaves like rate and the expense leverage we get from it. And if you see in the outlook section of the 10-Q that we filed, you'll see that we've - we're calling for higher RPC there as well. I mean, that's a single number. There's a lot of texture underneath. We're forecasting essentially nine months out, so who knows, but we're going to continue to push in this direction.","Jay Gelb","All right. Great. High RPCs. And then separate question on Small Commercial. We've seen a number of potential competitors looking to move into Small Commercial on a direct basis like Berkshire Hathaway and Progressive. What's your perspective on how much that business could shift to the direct channel given that Travelers primary presence on that is clearly an independent agent?","Gregory Toczydlowski","Jay, this is Greg. Small Commercial marketplace has always been a competitive section of the marketplace, and we obviously are monitoring, assessing all the competitors that enter that space. And we make the assumption that some of them are going to be successful, and we accordingly manage to that way. And in terms of channel preference, we're not seeing any material shift of channel preference right now. We believe we've got a model that's very effective, and we're investing to make it as frictionless as possible. So wherever the consumer ultimately goes in the future, we think we're going to be positioned very well.","Jay Gelb","Okay. Including direct?","Gregory Toczydlowski","Correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley.","Michael Phillips","I'll take a shot at this one. First, on the PYD. Any chance you can give the dollar impact on the New York law change?","Daniel Frey","Mike, it's Dan. I think we're going to not be real specific on that given that it's an issue that we expect to be involved in legislation over a particular coverage matter. We did try to give you at least direction of magnitude. Early in the press release, I think we talk about the year-over-year change in PYD, which on a pretax basis was pretty close to $100 million being primarily attributable to the Child Victims Act. And in our minds, that means more than half. But I think to get much tighter than that, would be more detail than we want to give.","Michael Phillips","Okay. No, I appreciate that. On the Workers' Comp PYD, was any of that from accident year '18?","Daniel Frey","That's a good question. Of the top of my head, I will tell you in one second. Comp, '18 is a very young year on a longtail line. So not a lot of movement in '18. Favorability and workers' comp is some recent accident years, but that's a little too recent for us to be making much of a change.","Michael Phillips","Okay. And then, I guess, on the Business Insurance, sticking with that for a second. Well, if you move in parts on the expense ratio from - you mentioned in the Q, the Simply Business expansion, the state assessment and such. I guess, is there a way for us to maybe help us think about how kind of a good run rate going forward would be? I don't know how much the state assessment was or how much the Simply Business expansion is worth and that kind of thing because it's a good expense ratio with a lot of moving parts there.","Daniel Frey","Yes, so it's Dan again. I guess I'll think about expense ratio more than enterprise level. And from a high level, we gave you some outlook at the end of last year, which was - expect in this year to be broadly consistent with what we saw last year. Last year, as an enterprise, we're at about a 30.1. This year, in the first quarter, it's a 29.7. There's a little bit of a benefit, as Greg mentioned, from this state assessment change would have put - you could think about that as 20 or 30 basis points back into the expense ratio. This is an example of things can be a little bit lumpy from one quarter to the next. We're happy with the expense ratio in the first quarter, but not taking that as a permanent improvement versus what we had expected previously.","Alan Schnitzer","Okay. Mike, just - just as a point of clarification, Mike that the Simply Business investment wouldn't be any expense ratio, just for clarification.","Michael Phillips","Okay. No, I guess, I was reading something out of the Q that said part of your G&A expense was due to expansion in Simply Business. That's what I was referring to.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, that's - it's G&A, but there's - all of G&A doesn't go into the expense ratio, Insurance G&A does. We can take it off-line.","Operator","Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question. I wanted to follow-up on some of the commentary on the renewal premium change within Business Insurance. So your outlook is now more positive for the year. If we go back, you guys did see a slowdown in the third and the fourth quarter on the renewal rate, which picked up this quarter. I know Commercial Auto and Property have been lines that are getting price for some time. So I'm just trying to get a better sense of what really drove the sequential increase and gave you conviction to raise your outlook for the rest of 2019?","Gregory Toczydlowski","Elyse, this is Greg. First of all, the outlook, as a reminder, is an estimate. And so we try to give you as much transparency in our best dealer around where that's going to go on a going forward basis. And if you look at the webcast slide for domestic BI, overall, you can see that the 6% for the first quarter, we think, is a terrific number and is the highest number on the page. And as Alan just said, we're going to continue pursuing our margin improvement campaign going forward also.","Alan Schnitzer","And Elyse, I would add that the rate increases are pretty broad other than workers' comp. So all products other than workers' comp higher sequentially and year-over-year, rate increases on a higher percentage of overall accounts, for example. So it's reasonably broad-based, although rational by product line relative with the returns we're getting in those lines.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That's great. And then my second question on international. You guys pointed to about one point of underlying margin drag within Business Insurance from your international business. I mean, you did give some color on steps that you're taking to look to improve the margins there. Can you just talk to time frame? I'm assuming there's a certain level of drag that's embedded within your outlook for the next three quarters of the year? And just how long you think those initiatives will take to work their way through your book of business?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, Elyse, this is - it's probably more precise than either we could get or would want to share on that. We're - we've got all the efforts focused on it. We're working on it. And we're - there is an assumption that some of what we saw in the first quarter was an aberration and a return to more normal levels reasonably quickly. And there's other work that we're going to be doing, that's going to take some more time. But to give you any more precision than that would probably be - would probably give you a set of precisions that just doesn't exist.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then in terms of the size of the first quarter losses, would you put it kind of in line with the fourth quarter of last year?","Alan Schnitzer","I think at least we're going to stick with the one point that Greg shared in his prepared remarks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.","Ryan Tunis","My question is just on this whole discussion around rate. And I guess, for Alan, are we at a point where the better-than-expected rate, the acceleration as you've been factoring into the way you're thinking about your outlook this year for margins? Or is it more just you're taking the rate where you need it, where you're seeing some elevated losses you're responding to it. So broadly, this is just a type of rate you essentially need to be able to keep things broadly consistent or certainly better on the year?","Alan Schnitzer","Ryan, if I understand your question, I think the answer is yes to both. The rate we're getting when - and we give you some perspective by segment in the outlook, and we give you some perspective on the outlook for margin in the outlook. And that does - the outlook we give you on margin does take into account, as best as we can tell what we're going to achieve in terms of rate and exposure.","Ryan Tunis","But it doesn't seem that the outlook for margins has changed materially despite the better - I guess the better rate we're seeing this quarter. So just trying to reconcile - I mean, how exactly are you thinking about the 22? Was - it's just, I guess, what was needed? Or do you feel better about what margins are going to be here in 2019 than you did when we talked at the fourth quarter call?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, again, to both. Yes, we feel good about the 22, and we feel great about the 6 points of overall pricing. If you go back and look at over - if you go back and look over a decade and you look at what rate and RPC have done, you'd say 6 point surprises. It's pretty good by historical standards and particularly when you think about the fact that in '16 - end of '16 into '17, total price actually never went negative. So before it went negative, it started moving back up. So we feel good about what we're achieving, and we feel good about returns.","Ryan, if you take the results in the quarter, and if you normalize for prior year development and weather, you get a pretty good result. And so we'd be probably a little bit less than what we printed because there were some other good things that happened, but you get a pretty good results. So we don't look at the returns that we're generating on a consolidated basis today and say they're disappointing. But as we look out the windshield into the future, we think there's more work to do in terms of achieving our objective of mid-teens over time. And so we're not disappointed with the 22, we're not disappointed with the six. And we're going to keep pushing. There's more work to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith","A couple of questions here for you. First one, Personal Auto. I noticed your outlook underlying margins looks for some deterioration for the rest of the year on auto. I'm just curious why is that? Is it because you're seeing the elevated severities, is that what you're kind of factoring?","Michael Klein","Sure, Brian, it's Michael Klein. No, it's actually not due to that. It's actually pretty consistent with the outlook we gave for the full year and has a lot to do with seasonality in the auto business. So when we gave the outlook for the full year, we said that auto experience would likely be better than the prior year in the first half and worse than the prior year in the second half. And this is really just a reflection of the first quarter rolling off. And now, we're just looking at the 9 months versus the 9 months.","Brian Meredith","So you're not seeing any issues with severity or anything?","Michael Klein","When you look at severity, I would say we continue to see some of the same things you're seeing in the industry, physical damage, repair costs continue to be rising, but they have been - when you look underneath that, you see a little bit of a shift in vehicles towards heavier vehicles and SUVs. You see higher repair costs due to improvements in technology and more technology in the vehicle. So we think that those severity trends sort of are persisting. The good news and we referred to this in our comments, is that frequency has continued to be better than expected and is - in the quarter was an offset to that and part of the result that we produced in Q1. But, again, the outlook is really just a quarter dropping off and consistent with the outlook that we had for the full year.","Brian Meredith","Got you. And then basically going back to the reserve development and business charts on the Childs Victim Act. Is that kind of - when you think about the charts, are you thinking about kind of on a national basis because of the law change there in New York? Or is it possible that this law in New York legislative action spreads to other states? And could it get worse?","Daniel Frey","Brian, so it's Dan. So to be clear, this reaction in the first quarter is to the New York change only, right? So we are setting reserves actuarially and from an accounting standards perspective based on what the law is. We're aware that there are a number of other states that have discussed possible similar legislation on a go-forward basis and are keeping a close eye on those. If more states enact, we would react accordingly as other states react. The one that looks to be sort of in the nearest term potentially ready to go would be New Jersey. We've made an assessment of New Jersey and would expect that to not be anywhere near the magnitude of what we just recognized for New York. But it's an ongoing issue in a number of states that we're keeping an eye on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski","Follow-up to Brian's question on personal lines. So auto results continued to outperform and that feels to be like an industry-wide trend. Maybe you can comment on if you expect the competitive environment there just to naturally get tougher? And then switching to the other side of personal lines, homeowner's results on underlying basis are deteriorating and it seems also be industry-wide trend and pricing does seem to be moving little north there. So I know those - you guys are mostly a bundled product shop. Maybe you can talk to whether those two conflicting trends there? And whether you feel that personal lines can start growing more for you guys going forward?","Michael Klein","Sure, Mike. Again, it's Michael Klein. And I think certainly sort of two components there. I will start with the segment, right? We're really pleased with the positioning of the segment. We are growing policies in the segment, growing premium in the segment and really had a terrific start to the year in terms of the total segment. If you look at the pieces, the auto competitive environment, certainly, we compete in that market every day. I think if you use competitive rate filings as the proxy for a level of competitiveness and you look at that data, you see that rate filings in the industry - the file rate for the industry is down period to period and continues to be lower increases in aggregate than the industry had filed for in the past. The aggregate, I think, 12-month rolling rate increase for the industry now is below 2%. So that could be a proxy for the competitive environment in auto.","And maybe just an additional comment on the outlook. While our outlook is for a higher combined ratio in the next 9 months than the prior 9 months, it's still a target return. So to your point, we're seeking to grow in the auto line. We're executing on marketing, distribution and marketplace execution strategies to do that. And as I said, the production results demonstrate improvements in new business, strong retention, moderating pricing that, I think, is all consistent with that view.","On the home side, again, most of the deterioration in underlying from the first quarter of last year is explained by the treaty. And so that's most of it. If you actually remove the treaty impact from the underlying combined ratio and compare that to history, it's very consistent with our long-run average underlying combined ratio in home. That said, there's some period-to-period volatility there. There is still some pressure in nonweather water loss activity, which we have talked about which is part of why you see RPC rising and why we're focusing on improving RPC as we go forward. But, again, I think we're very pleased with the performance of the property portfolio and the path we're on. And then conversely to the auto outlook that I described, the property outlook, again, mostly just because of the quarterization of the outlook is for better results on an underlying basis in property for the balance of the year sort of going the other away from auto. And when you put those two together, you get a better combined ratio outlook year-on-year.","Michael Zaremski","Got it. It's helpful. I did see the improved commentary in the outlook. One follow-up on commercial pricing. Thanks for the insights on Commercial Auto and Property driving the pricing increases. But I was wondering on workers' comp pricing, is that getting quarter-over-quarter more or less negative?","Gregory Toczydlowski","Mike, this is Greg. Yes, we really aren't going to share workers' comp on an individual line and the price and just because it is such an offensive dynamic of how we compete in the marketplace. We have in the past I've shared, and it's pretty evident that there's been very good loss results in workers' comp and there has been reductions in the market. So if you look at our RPC at 6%, clearly ex workers' comp, we'd be higher than that, and we really aren't going to disclose the individual product lines going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery.","Lawrence Greenberg","For Michael, again, on auto. And if you answered it, I apologize. But is written premium - written auto pricing keeping up with loss trend?","Michael Klein","I don't know if I spoke specifically to written keeping up with loss trend, but certainly, on an earned business, we continue to expand margins. And on a written basis at 5 points of RPC, I would say we're continuing to expand margins on both basis. I didn't speak specifically to that, but we feel good about the margin expansion. And again, the outlook is for auto to produce target returns.","Lawrence Greenberg","Great. And then in Bond & Specialty, I know the PYD jumps around quite a bit there. But it was modest this quarter. Is there anything changing on that front?","Thomas Kunkel","This is Tom, Larry. So the nature of the PYD in Bond & Specialty is it that it can be a little lumpy. If you look at our Surety business over the years, you can see we've had some really good returns. And as our losses were continuing to come down, we, of course, tried to accurately account for that in our initial year loss PIKs. So that the majority of the results would hopefully be shown in that first calendar year. So I think what you've seen over time is an improved initial loss year PIK. And maybe less headroom in some of those areas for that stuff to move up. All that said, in our Management Liability businesses there's been a little bit of that too as we look to recognize things in that initial year as best we can. So I think, other than that no other great underlying dynamics that would explain that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.","Meyer Shields","Going back to the pricing dynamics within Business Insurance. Is there a difference between what you're seeing and what we call standard lines versus specialty?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, we're sort of looking at. Greg, you want to take that?","Gregory Toczydlowski","Yes. Meyers, are you referencing specialties like E&S?","Meyer Shields","Yes.","Gregory Toczydlowski","Yes. I mean that depends so much on your product mix. I mean we're predominantly in the E&S business much more from a property perspective. So the answer would be yes, for us given some of the catastrophic pressures we've seen on property over the last two years.","Meyer Shields","Okay. And then more broadly I think this is mostly a question for Greg. We've seen in - at least the U.S. treasury, the pretty significant decline in interest rates from mid-November. How long does it take before that is reflected in pricing?","Daniel Frey","Meyer, it's Dan. So we'll consider that in pricing as we do a number of factors. It's one of the hundred things that go into the process of determining what's the right price. We've seen the 10-year treasury move up and down, but it's been sort of plus or minus 0.3, not more than 0.2 or 0.3 per quarter over the last 4 or 5 quarters. So not a dramatic impact. It does eventually get baked into what we think we need for price to generate the returns that we're trying to generate because clearly, that's a component of return, but it hasn't had a dramatic impact at this point.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, also I'd add that - we bifurcated a little bit. We think about the return on the flow and that we adjust periodically to reflect market rates and then separately we think about the capital on the balance sheet that supports the risk and that, that really reflects the overall portfolio return.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","I was reading outlook as everyone else was and I think it's not too different from what it said before. Despite the improvement you're getting on rates it's really the cessation of large losses and non-cat weather that will drive margin improvement for the remainder of the year. Am I reading that correctly?","Alan Schnitzer","If you're looking at Business Insurance, yes, that's right. It's large losses returning to a more normal level.","Joshua Shanker","And so can we say with the closed approximation that pricing and loss cost trend are in harmony right now, I guess, is your view?","Alan Schnitzer","I would say that's about right on an earned basis. On a written basis, we're probably doing little bit better than that.","Joshua Shanker","Okay. And just the same sort of reflections on the homeowner's business as well?","Michael Klein","Yes, Josh, this is Michael. I would say on the homeowner's business, we're working to move RPC north. So we're not quite there on a written basis yet, but we're close.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research.","Amit Kumar","I guess two quick follow-up questions. The first question goes back to the discussion on expense ratio. In your 10-Q letter, you talked about 40% of the business flowing through these business centers and BI. And I was curious if maybe you can talk about where does that sort of net out to? Is that an eventual improvement in expense ratio, or do the savings get reallocated somewhere else?","Alan Schnitzer","Amit, thanks for that question. Productivity and efficiency is a strategic priority across the entire place in each of the businesses. In a claim ordination virtually everything we do. And so some of what Greg's achieving to the business centers contributes to that. It also contributes to other strategic objectives specifically making sure that we're providing good experiences for the brokers that we're doing business with and the customers that we're serving so it all goes to that point. The savings - whatever productivity and efficiency we generate there and frankly, anywhere else, really for us is, we look at operating leverage or enhanced operating leverage as an opportunity. And as we said before, we'll take those dollars and we'll reallocate them over time as we see fit. We can let it fall to the bottom line and you'll see the expense ratio. We can reinvest it in strategic initiatives that we think are going to drive shareholder value. Or if we want to or need to we can decide that we want to put into pricing without compromising our return objectives. So I know you've heard us say that a lot but what's important to us about enhanced operating leverage is having that flexibility.","Amit Kumar","Now that you answered that question, the only other question I had is maybe for Michael, switching gears to personal auto. I know you answered several questions on what we saw on the loss cost trend. But can you sort of opine where do you see the trajectory from here on frequency and severity?","Michael Klein","Sure, Amit. It is Michael. The short answer is when we look at our sort of long-term trend, in fact, it remains relatively consistent. And I would say talking about frequency and severity a little bit separately, generally what we see on the severity side is quarter-to-quarter fluctuations that sort of bounce around our long-term expectation. So again, we see the severity pressure that you see in industry statistics around parts and liability cost and those things. But feel like our long-term assessment on severity reflects those. On the frequency side, again, we talked about the first quarter underlying being driven by pricing earning in excess of trend inclusive of both sort of our assumption and a better-than-expected result in the quarter. And we do see for a number of quarters in a row now frequency coming in better than I think we or the industry had expected it, and it's something we're keeping an eye on and thinking about how to factor in.","Amit Kumar","And is that - with the historical - frequency at a historical low, does that trend line continue or do you get a sense that probably this is as good as it gets?","Michael Klein","I think it's a great question. I think if you take a longer-term look at frequency in auto, you see a bit of a secular decline and that's the piece that we're trying to figure out as we're returning to sort of that long-term downward trend in frequency or not. There's been a lot of commentary and discussion around - in the marketplace and in other places about what could be driving it and one of the things people point to is safety features on vehicles. I think it is important to point out that a number of the features that folks like the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety point to as the ones that could have the most impact still have relatively low penetration in the fleet, right. Things like automatic emergency braking less than 5% of the cars on the road have it. So again, I think the journey is still out on whether there is a shift in long-term frequency trend but those are some of the things we're watching in addition to miles-driven employment and the other factors that we've talked about.","Operator","Your next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.","Yaron Kinar","My first question, I think Elyse took a stab at it, is in Business Insurance. Can you talk about the impact from the nonweather large losses this quarter? How it compared to the prior year?","Alan Schnitzer","Beyond - the international, is that what you're referring to Yaron?","Yaron Kinar","Well, I think last year, you just talked about large losses, nonweather losses, not necessarily referring to international.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, the large loss activity in domestic BI has been relatively flat, I would say.","Gregory Toczydlowski","I gave you in my comments here the non-cat weather was a little more than 0.5 point will be good guide relative to the first quarter of 2018.","Yaron Kinar","Right, right. I mean I think in 2018, you talk about roughly, 60 basis points of non-cat weather and another 60 basis points or so of other large, so it sounds like it couldn't really...","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, we're also slicing the bone probably a little bit - we're heading towards slicing the bone probably a little bit thinner than we'd like too. And I think most of the impact you're talking about was quarters two through four. And so my answer relatively flat was Q1 to Q1. But if you go back and look at your commentary from last quarter I think you'll hear us say that the improvement was primarily going to be in quarters two through four.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. That's helpful. And then Greg I think you'd said that in addition to pricing and also taking some terms and conditions, actions in large property. Can you give maybe a few examples of where the terms and conditions are improving or how they're improving?","Gregory Toczydlowski","Sure. Yes, coming off those two catastrophic years, there's obviously been some dislocation in the marketplace in just an opportunity for more risk sharing and that typically comes with terms and conditions. So you can think about sublimits on flood and earthquake, deductible shifting from a fixed component to more of the percentage certainly in the geographic exposed areas but that's something we're constantly looking at. With all that said, we look at our National Property business on account-by-account basis. So that's a generalization and we are, again, looking at each account and looking at the risk\/reward of those accounts. And if there's an opportune time to have some risk-sharing like there is in the property segment right now then we go about and achieve that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Schmitt with William Blair.","Jeffrey Schmitt","Question about your Umbrella book. Heard in the market that there's an uptick in large losses there, mainly due to the litigation environment higher jury awards, higher settlement amounts. Is that something you're seeing at all?","Alan Schnitzer","Let me - let's stay away from Umbrella. Let me just respond to social inflation more broadly. So I - this is probably an oversimplification. But I think, about social inflation probably in three buckets. I think about legal decisions, I think about plaintiff activity and I think about jury awards. From a legal decision's perspective, certainly, at the federal level, over the last couple of years, I'd say that's probably been on balance and improvement. If you look at jury awards, I would say a little bit more volatile, a little bit more unpredictable. And broadly speaking when it comes to plaintiff activity, the plaintiff's bar I would say we have seen a more aggressive plaintiff activity. Now that was certainly a big driver of the Commercial Auto charge that we took last quarter for example. We think about the liability side of C&P for example, but when you get into the larger end when you get into Umbrella when you think about the large end of GL, when you think about Management Liability, those are broadly speaking coverages where there's already a lot of litigation. Generally, everybody is represented in those cases and so those have always been reasonably active in terms of litigation. It's really at least so far on the smaller end where we've seen more activity.","Jeffrey Schmitt","Yes, and I guess, I was curious I mean it's been more acute obviously in Commercial Auto than other lines hearing they're starting to tick up in Umbrella. I guess, is that spreading or I mean it sounds like you're saying it's a little bit more broad-based already?","Alan Schnitzer","No. I mean we're certainly seeing it. The phenomenon you're identifying could vary from company to company based on mix of business too, right. The net lines you put out, the types of risk. I mean you got to remember, we are - we're a Middle Market Main Street business for the most part. I mean obviously we do have a National Accounts business, a National Property business. And we do write public company liability on Management Liability side but, by and large, when you think about Travelers, it's a Main Street middle market business. So it could be a mixed difference for us relative to others.","Jeffrey Schmitt","And just one quick one on the homeowner's book looking at the underlying loss ratio up 100 basis points, half of that looks to be about related to the new cat treaty. But this remainder of 100 basis points after being up a lot last year, is this - is that pretty much all nonweather water losses that you're seeing? Can you speak to that more? Is that state-specific? Is this older homes? I mean, why is this popping up now for the industry?","Michael Klein","Sure, Jeff. Just starting with the premise of the question I would say the treaty impacts a little more than you're estimating there and therefore, the other impacts are a little bit less in the underlying. But then underneath that we, again, as I mentioned we do continue to see some nonweather water loss pressure. And I would stay consistent with what we've talked about in the past we've sort of sliced and diced that by geography, by type of home, by age of home. We've looked at - we've seen commentary around the first floor, second floor, so we've looked at it by type of construction. And what we tend to see is these nonweather water losses are up sort of consistently across most of those dimensions. So there's not a thing we point to, which is why our strategy to address it has been to seek to increase price. So that be our view on the trend. But the underlying in the quarter does reflect some continued pressure there. Again, we expected some continued pressure there and have built a pricing strategy to address it. So that's our take on it.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to the presenters.","Abbe Goldstein","Great.

Welcome to the Third Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 18, 2018.","At this time, I would like to turn your conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.","Abbe Goldstein","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter 2018 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplements and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com, under the Investors section.","Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance, Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions.","Before I turn the call over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance.","Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.","Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in our Investors section on our website.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, you've seen our numbers and we're pleased with the results. This morning we reported third quarter net income of $709 million or $2.62 per diluted share, generating return on equity of 12.6%. Core income was $687 million or $2.54 per diluted share.","Our core return on equity of 12% was strong, particularly considering that while catastrophe and non-cat weather losses were significantly lower than last year's quarter. In the aggregate, they were nonetheless elevated relative to our expectation.","Our performance this quarter is the result of excellent underwriting execution across a diverse portfolio of businesses, a successful and consistent investment strategy, and the continuation of our strategy of returning excess capital to our shareholders. Notably, our results this quarter benefited from record high net earned premium and the sub-30% consolidated expense ratio, reflecting progress that we're making on our strategic agenda.","About a year ago, we explained that our strategic plans were largely geared toward creating top-line opportunities and that improving productivity and efficiency was an important component of our strategy. Each of our business segments has contributed on both counts. They've done so by successfully implementing technology workflow and product enhancements, and by making sure that we're delivering compelling value to our customers and distribution partners.","Before I get further into the results, I want to acknowledge the devastation caused by hurricanes Florence and Michael. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been impacted. Following events like these, our claim organization works hard to make sure that our customers see the value of the promise they bought from us, and our agent and brokers see the value of the Travelers' promise they sold.","Case in point, as of today, we've closed more than 90% of our homeowners' claims arising out of Hurricane Florence. And we're bringing the same level of urgency for our customers impacted by Hurricane Michael. We're thankful for the extraordinary effort by our claim professionals.","Turning to production, we were pleased with the success of our marketplace execution. Growth in each segment contributed to consolidated net written premium growth of 6%.","In domestic business insurance, retentions remain historical highs, which is a reflection of the fact we have a high quality book of business and the significant percentage of it is meeting our return expectations.","Renewal premium change, including pure rate and exposure, is strong at around 5%, which is about 2 points higher than in the prior year quarter and stable sequentially. Inside that, pure rate is up about 1 point quarter-over-quarter and down a little sequentially. And economic activity is contributing to a healthy level of exposure growth.","At this level, pricing is more or less offsetting loss trend, but as you know, we don't manage the headline number. There is a continuum of price change with workers' comp at the low-end and commercial auto at the high-end. In between, there are accounts, products and geographies, where we need more price and others where we don't. And we'll execute accordingly.","In terms of pricing and profitability, there are a number of factors that impact our returns beyond rate and loss trend. First, we actively manage all the available levers, such as risk selection, mix of business, claim and expense initiatives, volume, reinsurance, and so on. Beyond that, there are a few environmental factors at play. A decade after the financial crisis, interest rates and as a result net investment income are moving higher. As I mentioned, economic activity is generating exposure growth. And thanks to tax reform, we're benefitting from a level playing field and a lower tax rate.","We take all that into account in our pricing strategy to achieve our target returns. We follow the same approach across all of our businesses. Turning to Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 5% with strong production in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses.","In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 6%, benefiting from continued successful execution in Agency Auto and [PIT] [ph] growth in Agency Homeowners. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Tom and Michael, about the segment results.","Before I pass the microphone, I'd like to share a few thoughts about some of the investments we've made and are making. We've grown our top-line year to date by over $2 billion or 11% as compared to the same period in 2016. Over that same two-year period, we've managed G&A expenses to about flat. You've seen the impact in our expense ratio.","In addition to a lot of hard work by the best field organization in the business, our ability to have done that has been enabled by significant investments in things like core technology and work flow. We've been making these investments over some time, while delivering leading returns and we continue to invest thoughtfully and strategically.","As we shared with you before, in terms of innovation, we have three clear priorities: to extend our lead in risk expertise; provide great experiences for our customers, agents and brokers; and improve productivity and efficiency. We're encouraged by the progress we're making. As you've probably heard, we recently announced that we've teamed up with Amazon to launch an industry-first digital storefront.","This initiative is designed to create new opportunities for us and our agents to attract and serve customers and help them take a more proactive approach to home safety in an increasingly digital world. It's obviously very early days, but overtime, we are hopeful that this and similar initiatives will lead to new business opportunities, improve loss costs and provide us with valuable insights.","This past summer, we made a majority investment in Zensurance, a Toronto-based digital provider of online insurance solutions for small businesses. It's a natural fit with our Simply Business team, further adding to our digital capabilities and medium-term strategic positioning to serve the micro and small commercial customer.","We also recently announced an investment in Kittyhawk, the market leader in enterprise drone operations software, further enhancing our position as an industry leader in the use of drone technology.","In short, we believe the winners in our industry will be those with deep domain expertise, who can continue to deliver industry-leading results while innovating successfully on top of a foundation of excellence. Internally, we refer to it as our perform-and-transform mandate. From a position of strength, we believe that we have the talent, resources, expertise and focus to do just that.","For the past 66 quarters, this is the point in the call that we pass the microphone to Jay Benet. Today, I'm pleased to be passing the microphone to Dan Frey, but before I do that, a word about Jay. It's hard to overstate the impact that Jay has had on Travelers. He is a big talent and virtually every milestone in the modern life of this company bears his marks. Having said that, this day was foreseeable and we were well prepared. And thankfully, we'll continue to benefit from Jay's experience and wisdom, so continue to serve on the senior leadership team as Vice Chairman.","One of Jay's biggest achievements is having developed a world-class bench of finance talent including Dan Frey. Dan brings more than three decades of finance and accounting experience to the role. He served in the number of strategic financial management roles across Travelers over the past 15 years, most recently as the CFO of Personal Insurance. I couldn't be more pleased to have Dan as a partner. His deep technical expertise, strategic mindset and collaborative style make him the perfect fit to help lead Travelers into the future.","And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Frey","Thank you, Alan. Core income for the third quarter was $687 million, up $434 million from the prior year quarter, and core ROE was 12%, up from 4.5%. The significant improvement in both measures from last year's third quarter resulted primarily from the lower level of weather-related losses and very strong net investment income.","Our third quarter results include $264 million of pre-tax cat losses, a significant amount although well below the $700 million in the prior year quarter, accounting for 6.9 points of improvement in the combined ratio. Prior year reserve development was slightly favorable in comparable quarter-over-quarter. The consolidated underlying combined ratio was 93%, which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD remains steady. As a higher level of non-cat weather losses was mostly offset by the improvement in our expense ratio.","Our pre-tax underlying - underwriting gain of $448 million remains steady, as increases in Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance were largely offset by results in Personal Insurance.","Pre-tax net investment income increased by $58 million from the prior year quarter to $646 million, while after-tax NII increased by $90 million to $547 million. Both measures benefited from the more favorable interest rate environment and increase in average invested assets resulting from continued growth in net written premiums and favorable results in our non-fixed income portfolio. On an after-tax basis, NII also benefited from the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate.","As we had expected after-tax fixed income NII increased by $60 million, and we expect after-tax fixed income NII in the fourth quarter will increase by $60 million to $65 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 as net written premiums continue to grow and reinvestment rates are expected to exceed existing rates on upcoming maturities.","Net favorable prior year reserve development of $14 million pre-tax or $10 million after-tax was comparable with the prior year quarter. On a year-to-basis, net favorable prior year reserve development was $350 million. Both Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance experienced net favorable PYD this quarter.","Business Insurance experienced net unfavorable PYD driven by a $225 million increase to asbestos reserves along with $57 million increase to commercial auto reserves that resulted from elevated severity in recent accident years partially offset by favorability in the workers' compensation line. Excluding the asbestos charge, Business Insurance had $169 million of net favorable prior year reserve development.","The asbestos reserve increase resulted from the completion of our annual asbestos review during the third quarter. The increase was driven by higher estimates of projected settlement and defense costs from mesothelioma claims compared to what we had previously expected. As has been the case in previous years while there was some slight improvement in several of our asbestos indicators, our expectation had been from more of an improvement. This phenomenon has continued to result in periodic reserve strengthening for us and for others in the industry.","The numbers of deaths from mesothelioma, which we believe as a leading indicator of further asbestos payments has trended downwards somewhat during this decade. At the same time, the mix of mesothelioma deaths by age has shifted to older cohorts. That may be the result of medical advances over time successful treating a variety of other deadly diseases, allowing more people who work with asbestos when it was prevalent in the workplace prior to the late 1970s to live long enough to the develop mesothelioma in their 70s and 80s.","Ultimately, this high-risk cohort will become smaller over time, so we continue to expect that the current claim environment will improve as time goes on.","Bond & Specialties net favorable prior year reserve development of $53 million pre-tax was driven by domestic Management Liability, while in Personal Insurance, the net favorable PYD of $17 million pre-tax was driven by domestic personal auto.","Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.7 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.4 billion. While, it was already overfunded, we made a discretionary contribution of $200 million to our qualified pension plan before we filed our 2017 tax return in September, which provided a 35% rather than a 21% tax benefit resulting in $28 million economic tax benefit in the third quarter.","Recent increases in interest rates, which have benefited our fixed income NII have resulted in a modest net unrealized investment loss impacting shareholders' equity. As of September 30, we had an unrealized investment loss of $447 million after-tax. Remember the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio nor our business.","We generally hold fixed investments to maturity, but quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have had little or no impact on our statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, is now $86.51, 4% higher than at the beginning of the year.","We continue to generate excess capital, and accordingly returned $607 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter. Comprising share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $207 million. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned $1.76 billion of capital to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases.","While it obviously do not impact our third quarter results, I'd like to provide some commentary regarding Hurricane Michael. While much of the media focused on this storm has been on the devastation of homes in Florida, and our thoughts are with all those impacted, it's worth noting that this was a multiday event impacting both personal lines and commercial lines in a number of states. In addition to Florida, the PCS footprint also includes Alabama, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. Given that, it's just a week or so since the storm hit, we are still assessing our view of losses from the event.","At this point, we expect the losses from this storm to be significant. In terms of meeting the threshold for inclusion in the schedule of catastrophes in our quarterly SEC filings, but manageable relative to the fourth quarter overall and not something that would preclude us from resuming stock buybacks next week.","And with that, I'll turn the microphone over to Greg.","Gregory Toczydlowski","Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced segment income of $410 million and a combined ratio of 100.6% for the quarter both significantly better than the prior year quarter due primarily to a significantly lower level of catastrophes this year. The unfavorable prior year reserve development that Dan mentioned had 1.5 point impact on the combined ratio.","The underlying combined ratio of 95.4% was 1 point better than the prior year quarter as non-cat property fire losses, which were elevated in the prior year, returned to more normal levels. Although, the underlying loss ratio improved from the prior year, it was impacted by about above 1 point from higher than expected non-cat weather.","For perspective, the third quarter of 2018 included 18 PCS in equivalent events outside the U.S. that did not meet our cat threshold, while 2017 had only 6. While losses from non-cat weather were unfavorable to our expectation, cat losses were favorable. In the aggregate of the cat and non-cat weather was generally in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our expense ratio improved by around 0.5 point as we remain focused on managing expenses thoughtfully while making ongoing strategic investments and prudently growing the business.","Turning to the top line, net written premiums were strong for the quarter at $3.6 billion, up 6% over the prior year quarter driven by strong production results. Regarding domestic production, we achieved strong renewal premium change of 5.1% with renewal rate change of 1.8%, while retention was exceptional at 86%.","New business of $467 million was up 7% from a year-ago. Pure rate is up more than 1 point from the third quarter of 2017 and down a bit sequentially, but as you know, we executed a very granular level. We continue to achieve renewal rate gains broadly across our Middle Market accounts with auto, CMP, GL, property and umbrella all having positive rate increases. Auto continues to be the line with the highest level of rate consistent with our view of performance of the line.","We're pleased with these production results in consistent with Alan's comment, we continue to execute our marketplace strategy to meet our return objective with thoughtful balance towards retaining our best business, improving pricing where it's needed and pursuing attractive new business opportunities.","Turning to the individual businesses. In select, renewal premium change and renewal rate were stable, while retention remained strong at 83%. New business was 5% over the prior year quarter as we continue to leverage our investments in technology and workflow initiatives. In Middle Market, renewal premium change was 4.7% with renewal rate change of 1.6%, while retention remained historically high at 87%.","New business premiums of $269 million were flat to the prior year quarter in aggregate. In our core commercial accounts business, where our business initiatives are most advanced, new business was up 5% as we continue to be more active in the market with increased quote activity.","In closing, Alan laid out our innovation agenda across the company. As we shared with you at last year's Investor Day, for Business Insurance that means furthering our capabilities around customer solutions, convenient processes and competitive cost structure. Our strong marketplace execution including the impact from the progress we've made on the strategic initiative have contributed to our ability to deliver nearly $600 million of additional net written premium year-to-date in 2018, while keeping insurance G&A expenses generally flat.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom to talk about Bond & Specialty Insurance.","Thomas Kunkel","Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered strong returns in growth across the business. Segment income of $196 million was up $60 million from the prior year quarter due primarily to a higher level of favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio was an exceptional 78.3%.","Net written premiums for the quarter were up 5% driven by broad growth across our businesses. These results reflect the impacts of strategic products, marketing and distribution initiatives to grow these profitable lines, including workflow enhancements to drive improved efficiency and productivity internally as well as for our agents and brokers. Advanced analytics leveraging our valuable proprietary in third party data to refine our marketing and underwriting strategies, and improvements in value added capabilities to further distinguish our product and service offerings in the marketplace.","Turning to production. In our domestic Management Liability business, given the level of returns we are achieving we continue to execute our strategy to retain a substantial percentage of our high quality portfolio, while pursuing attractive new business. So we are pleased that the retention came in at a very strong 89% for the quarter with the renewal premium change of 3 points. New business was at a record level up 12% from the prior year quarter.","So Bond & Specialty results were excellent and we continue to feel great about our execution in the marketplace, our growth in returns and the opportunities that are strong market position and competitive advantages present for the future.","And now, I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.","Michael Klein","Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance this quarter, we continue to deliver on our objectives of balancing growth and profitability in auto and sustaining momentum in homeowners. Segment income of $153 million, increased $76 million over the prior year, while their combined ratio of 97.2% improved 2.5 points.","These improvements were primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses and a modest amount of favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by higher underlying loss experience, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.","Agency Auto delivered a strong quarter, with a combined ratio of 91.3%, down 14.7 points from the prior year quarter. While the quarter benefited from 1.8 points in favorable reserve development, as well as 6.7 points from lower catastrophe losses, the main story is the continued improvement in underlying auto profitability.","The underlying combined ratio improved over 6 points to 92.6%. Primarily as a result of the continued successful execution of our underwriting and pricing strategies, as well as frequency that was better than we expected.","Taking our year-to-date underlying combined ratio for Agency Auto of 94.8% and factoring in our normal expectation for a seasonally higher fourth quarter combined ratio, we're on track to be within our targeted combined ratio range for the full year, which is sooner than we originally expected.","In Agency Homeowners & Other, the third quarter combined ratio of 100.3% was impacted by a significant number of catastrophe and the non-catastrophe events. Catastrophes, including the Carr Wildfire and Hurricane Florence added 11 points to the combined ratio this quarter, a slight improvement relative to the third quarter of 2017.","The high number of other PCS events that Greg mentioned, along with a variety of additional non-catastrophe weather events, accounted for roughly 6 points of the 10 point increase in the underlying combined ratio for the quarter. The remainder of the increase was largely attributable to non-weather loss activity, including elevated water and fire losses.","As we indicated last quarter, we are actively factoring this more recent loss experience into our granular pricing and underwriting decisions. Renewal premium changes have increased year-over-year and we expect an acceleration in Homeowners' pricing in future quarters.","Turning to the top-line, Agency Auto premiums grew 6%, driven primarily by price increases, which continue to moderate consistent with our plans and in line with improving profitability. In addition, we're pleased with the modest improvements in retention and a 2% increase in new business, the first year-over-year increase since the first quarter of 2017.","In Agency Homeowners & Other, we remain pleased with our momentum, delivering 6% growth in both net written premiums, as well as policies in-force, while achieving renewal premium change of 3.8%.","All in for the segment, results continue to improve and we're pleased with our progress in our plans to generate profitable growth going forward.","As Alan mentioned, we're excited about our new relationship with Amazon, along with the other strategic initiatives we have underway, including the ongoing roll out of Quantum Home 2.0, further expansion of our IntelliDrive auto telematics program and continuing investments in digital capabilities that improve ease of doing business for our customers and agents, while making us more efficient and effective.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.","Abbe Goldstein","Thank you. We're ready to begin question-and-answers, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will now conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. First, best wishes for Jay for his retirement. And congrats to Dan on the new position. My first question is on non-cat losses. You have elevated non-cat losses for several quarters now. And so yet in your outlook, you expect them to normalize in 2019. So what give you confidence that recent experience will not be the new normal?","Alan Schnitzer","I guess, Kai, when we're - the outlook section, Business Insurance, that underlying margin, I think as we reflect in those words, is a reflection of large losses returning to more normal levels by historical standards.","Kai Pan","So at what time - at what point, I'm wondering those recent experience will factor in into your outlook or normalized non-cat losses.","Alan Schnitzer","Is that a PI comment, you're\u2026?","Dan Frey","Is that PI question, Kai?","Kai Pan","I think of probably for both, if you can comment on both PI as well as the BI.","Alan Schnitzer","Kai, if we're talking about weather, this is the insurance business and there is going to be volatility in weather. And we acknowledge that we've had a run of quarters where we've had some variability in both cat and non-cat weathers. But if you go back and take the longer view, looking at cats and non-cat weather together, for the whole place, 2009 was better than we expected.","We had a run from, I think it was 2010 to 2012 that was worse than we expected. At the end of 2012, we were thinking, gee, is this a new normal. And then, we went into a period of 2013 to 2015 that was favorable. 2016 was sort of spot on. And then, you got 2017, so far 2018 that has - that's been elevated.","And so, we're - our objective is to get it right. Missing it too high is no better than missing it too low. Our objective is to get it right and make that we're pricing our product over time for what we expect on an overtime basis. And we think that we're effectively doing that.","In terms of - if this is a question about modeling and you're trying to figure out how to think about your model for next year, we give you all the help we can in the outlook section of the 10-K and 10-Q. But thinking about this business on a longer term, we're taking all the data we have into account. We're thinking about everything we know about the future and making sure we're pricing our product for the long term.","Kai Pan","And so, you don't think sort of like is there a secular change in term of weather pattern that could change your expectations?","Alan Schnitzer","Kai, I mean, I don't know whether you measure weather cycles by the year, by the decade or by the millennia. I mean, we know it's in our data and we can see that. And part of this isn't just weather. It's population migration into more wildfire and weather prone areas.","And so, we take all of that, and all the history into account when we think about both our underwriting, our risk selection, geographically where we want to be, what kind of risks we want to write, terms and conditions, what our risk control people look for when they're going out, looking at the property to underwrite it. And we take it into account in pricing.","But I'm - we're very interested in the question you ask, which is why off the top of my head I knew what weather had done going back almost a decade. And we follow it very carefully, and take all that into account when we're thinking about the future.","Kai Pan","Thank you very much for that. My second question on workers' compensation, some of your peers indicated there is a rising frequency trend in workers' comp claims. I just wonder if you could discuss your experience, as well as, as the pricing is going down, will you will be able to maintain the underlying margin in this line of business?","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah, Kai, so we've obviously followed all the chatter in worker's comp with great interest in - that's a business that we've historically been very good in. And we got a big set of data and we like that business a lot.","But getting back to your question, let's - loss trend, frequency and severity, those are selections, right? Those are management estimates based on actuarial analysis of history and a view of expected trends. And that is a view that goes into both pricing and reserving. So you set up those expectations. And then you look at the data quarter by quarter as it comes in. And there are always ups and downs in the data every single quarter in virtually every product line.","And so, you look at those ups and downs and you take a step back and you say, okay, what do we think caused those things to go up and down? Sometimes we know and sometimes we don't. And is that normal variability, normal volatility in that measure or is there something more fundamental going on that we expect to persist into the future?","So particularly in a long tail line, you'd be pretty careful about making a dramatic change based on one quarter of data. So I'll tell you, we're watching it very closely. We do see ups and downs in these measures from time to time. We haven't seen anything year to date that's caused us to move off our loss picks.","And, Kai, back to your other question, you asked - given pricing, will we be able to maintain returns in the product. If pricing is going down and everything else is equal - I mean, pricing is for sure an input into returns. If pricing is going down and everything else is equal, then the margins in the product will go down, that's just arithmetic.","Pricing isn't the only factor. There is loss trend, as we just discussed. There is risk selection, there is claims handling. There are all the other levers that go into the return of a product. But your question, will rate - the decline in rate causes the return to go down, if that's the only thing that changes, yes. But that's not the only lever that there is. We're not going to get into a forecast of margins on a product-by-product basis.","Kai Pan","Great. I really appreciate all the answers.","Alan Schnitzer","Thanks, Kai.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. I just had a - I guess in Business Insurance, the $160 million or so of total favorable development, I think, that's excluding the commercial auto, and excluding the asbestos. What's contributing to that? Is that basically entirely workers' comp or are there other liability lines that are also showing some redundancy?","Dan Frey","Hey, Ryan. It's Dan. So one clarification, so the $169 million was excluding asbestos only. So it is reduced by the commercial auto strengthening. Most of the driver of the remainder of the favorability in Business Insurance is coming from the worker's comp line, although there is some favorability in the other general liability once you exclude asbestos. But worker's comp, that's the big driver.","Ryan Tunis","Great. And I think probably from Michael. Just on the home results, I think you said elevated water and fire, it was 4 or 5 points of loss ratio deterioration. Just trying to understand like exactly what's going on there why that's a trend? Why that's something you think you need to price for? What's driving that? What could be driving that? Just trying to understand, what the loss trend is in the non-cat?","Michael Klein","Sure, Ryan. Thanks for the question. And I'll just clarify it. So the 10-point deterioration in the quarter again roughly 6 points, roughly two-thirds of it, is coming from non-cat weather which includes PCS events that don't meet our threshold for a major cat as well as the other weather that I talked about. Your point about the other water losses and the fire again in the 10 points - the remainder of the 10 points was largely due to those. That's not 4 or 5 points. It's a smaller number than that, call it roughly a third. And it's about 50-50 non-weather water and fire inside that.","I would say the fire experience is very much sort of normal period-to-period volatility. I think the non-weather water is something we've been watching, I think, you've heard others probably talk about non-weather water losses. We're digging into it, we haven't found smoking gun underneath it. But we have seen a deterioration in that experience and that is one of the underlying drivers that's causing us to rise price and expect an acceleration in homeowners RPC on a go-forward basis.","Tying back to Alan's comments earlier on non-cat weather and underlying results, again you sort of look at - we look at all of that and our baking a portion of that into our outlook and into our underwriting and pricing strategies on a go-forward basis.","So we are factoring in elevated loss levels that we've been seeing recently into our pricing and underwriting decisions and our pricing and underwriting strategy, which is again why you see our outlook for pricing to be higher.","Ryan Tunis","Got you.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith","Yeah, thanks. Couple of quick questions here. First, I'm just curious, how are your interest rates, is that having impact on, kind of, how your pricing models are coming out at this point, any impact on it?","Alan Schnitzer","Well, I guess a couple of things on that. One, it's certainly an input into our pricing models, no question about that. It's hard to isolate, how any one factor is going to impact pricing, right? Yes. You start with - the return on the product when the policy renewals and then you put rate loss trend, interest rate assumptions, et cetera into it, and you come up with the price. But is that your question, Brian?","Brian Meredith","Yeah, yeah, exactly. I'm just wondering, if some of the impact we're seeing maybe on your renewal rates has anything to do with just the higher interest rates going into your, kind of, calculation.","Alan Schnitzer","I don't think so. First of all, because the duration of the assets, it's going to take a while for that to really ramp up and work its way in. And then, as the risk free rate goes up, our cost of equity goes up, and that's also an input into our pricing model. So I wouldn't say that the increase in interest rates is a dampener on price.","Brian Meredith","Great. And just quickly on the Amazon, and I guess connected homes. I wonder if you could dive a little more into that? What do you think the kind of benefit you'll see from a loss trend perspective? Or is there some kind of metrics you could give us that when you got a connected home loss experience is supposed to be 20%, 15%, 30% better?","Michael Klein","Sure, Brian. It's Michael. Thanks for the question. And again, it's - I would say, it's a long game we're playing here, and it's certainly something that we think will create opportunities for both us and our agents. We do believe that connected home devices should have a favorable impact on loss experience. It's very early days, we've not only been doing the work with Amazon, we've been connecting other experiments with other smart home device providers to try to quantify the benefits.","What I can tell you is that we are filing to expand the discount for connected home devices in conjunction with this and the other work we've been doing, and moving that discount to about 5% as we roll the new Quantum Home product out across the country. So that's probably the best number I can give you to put a point on it. But again, it's early days and it's - we are very much looking forward to the teaming up with Amazon and to some of the other experiments to gain insights into the impact of these devices on loss experience.","Brian Meredith","Great. Very helpful. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. I was hoping you give us a little bit more thoughts on the ultimate trend for the expense levels - expense ratios in both Business Insurance and Personal lines business? And just how far you think you can push that number around?","Alan Schnitzer","I think, we're going to avoid that temptation to try to forecast the expense ratio. We give you all the outlook on margins in outlook sections that I think, we want to give. And I - but there's a really important strategic point here. Productivity and efficiency are very important initiatives around here, everybody is focused on it, but it's not necessarily for the purpose of just lowering the expense ratio. It's for the purpose of giving us flexibility from the financial perspective.","We're trying to create flexibility to take that benefit and either let it fall to the bottom line, we can reinvest it in important strategic initiatives, where we can make a decision to put into price without compromising our return threshold. So while it's on everybody's mind here, and it's a big focus for us, it's not just about managing an expense ratio.","Paul Newsome","Do you have a target or a goal in terms of the number of investments that you want to put in some of these, sort of, new insuretech-type businesses that you focus on this quarter?","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah. There is not a bogey that we would share from just competitive sensitivity perspective, we certainly think about the opportunity and what it's worth when we invest in these things. But we've made a deliberate decision so far not to set up a fund or allocate a certain amount of dollars to an initiative like that. We may change our mind. But at least our perspective now is, you do something like that and then you end up spending the money whether you find value in it or not. The fact of the matter is we generate a lot of excess capital. Our objective is to reinvest that money any time we can, when we think we can create shareholder value with it.","So having said that, we are very, very disciplined about every dollar we spent and we put it up against a lot of metrics and measures to make sure we're getting that value out of it. But I wouldn't put a number or scope the opportunity.","Paul Newsome","Thanks for the call.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning. Two quick - I guess, follow-up questions. The first question goes back to Kai's question on workers' compensation. Would it be possible maybe just talk a bit more about how should we be thinking about the pricing, because if you look at some of the pricing surveys, comp pricing is still in the negative territory, but coming back. And what would be really helpful is, just broadly, if you exclude workers' comp, how will the pricing look like?","Alan Schnitzer","Well, on workers' comp, I don't know if you're looking for forecast on pricing, where that's going obviously we're not going to get down to forecasting the pricing in a line. I mean, that's not much more competitively sensitive than that. But what I will say about pricing in the workers' comp, it's a reflection of a line of business that's been very profitable for us. So there's nothing about the pricing dynamics so far that's a surprise to us.","Amit Kumar","Okay. The other question is a follow-up on the Amazon relationship. I was a bit surprised that it wasn't somewhat of an exclusive relationship and in the fine print it shows that's in four or five states and it's initially targeting, I guess, 15,000 customers who will get the free echo. Can you just talk about the trajectory? And did you try to be in exclusive relationship or not? Just give some background on that.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes. Sure, Amit. The 15,000 you referenced is a specific target of devices for the state of California only. And that's just the unique feature of the way we set the arrangement of in that state. To your point, just to give background for the rest of the group. The first four states - and this is really driven by regulatory filings and regulatory requirements. There was actually an endorsement of the policy that's required for us to be able to make the offer. And so we're essentially linking the Echo Dot offer and the discounts on the connected devices with that filing as we make it and get it approved across the country.","So the first four states are just the initial four states, we plan to extended two additional states as we go-forward. And again, the 15,000 is just a number of devices specifically for California subject to the terms of the agreement with Amazon. As respect to your question about an exclusive, we're not going to comment sort of specifically about the details and the terms of the agreement beyond that.","But again, I bring you back to - we're excited about this opportunity, we think it's a great opportunity for us. We are excited about the relationship with Amazon, and we're excited about the opportunity it presents for our agents and brokers to promote the program and how to sell these home safety solutions to our customers.","Amit Kumar","Thanks for that color. I will stop here. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning, everybody. First question, going back to the expense ratio. Just seems like a real step function improvement this quarter, I know, you've highlighted the expense management initiatives for a while and we've seen the earned premium growth as well. But I was just curious, if there was anything else specific this quarter that was driving this improvement, whether it was timing or other one-offs that helped the ratio here?","Alan Schnitzer","No. There is nothing unusual underneath it. There is no timing or sort of onetime things that are artificially improving in it, a lot of hard work over a long period of time enabled by years of investments in technology and workflow that's enabled it.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And it just all came together this quarter, I guess?","Alan Schnitzer","I mean, you've seen an expense number that's been flat over a pretty long period of time. And you've seen an expense ratio that's been on a decline. So I mean, it's sub-30. It's just as good a number as we've printed in a long time. But as we see it, the continuation of a trend.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Fair enough. And then going back a second to non-cat weather specifically and BI. I noticed that you exited the - I think, the open market property in Lloyd's this quarter. Would that or should that have some positive impact on non-cat weather going forward, you think?","Gregory Toczydlowski","Yeah, Yaron. This is Greg Toczydlowski. That's a real small portion of our overall Lloyd's book and hence it's a real small portion of our overall BI portfolio. So it really wouldn't have a material impact on the loads of the business going forward.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And would you be wanting to tell us what's the year-over-year change in non-cat weather was and BI?","Alan Schnitzer","I don't think that's detail that we've given. We did tell you that non-cat weather and BI, I think, what Greg said was about a point relative to what we would have expected. Hopefully, that's useful color for you.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Josh Shanker","Yeah, thank you for taking my question, and good morning. Following up on Yaron's question, I might have it wrong in my notes. But I think in 3Q 2017 you said you had 200 to 250 basis points of manmade fire losses that were elevated in 3Q 2017, and now we have a 100 basis points of elevated non-cat weather. Maybe my numbers are wrong there. But if I strip those two items out, am I wrong to come to the conclusion that the underlying true-true underlying loss ratio in BI has deteriorated over the last 12 months?","Alan Schnitzer","I mean, it's certainly worse by - I don't know exactly what your math was. But I don't know. There is another 50 basis points or something like that that we would just consider the normal variability in the insurance business. But I wouldn't consider it a structural - I mean, the word deterioration suggest the systemic structural deterioration. We wouldn't say that. We'd say there is another 50 basis points of just variability and this is the insurance business.","Josh Shanker","Well, I mean, if I go back to like the 3Q 2017 10-Q, the projection was that margins would improve as I guess these items - I guess, am I - and my numbers - I guess, are my numbers right, there were 200 to 250 basis points of fire losses a year ago embedded in the numbers, is that still correct?","Alan Schnitzer","That is correct.","Josh Shanker","Okay. And then, I think we've been through it in the past, but I just want to go through it again. You got a very, very good quarter on alternative investments results. And in terms of when you record them, the limited purchase and whatnot, are they on a lag, are they in real-time? Can we just talk about how those are recorded and how we should think about that going forward?","William Heyman","Sure. It's Bill Heyman. Actually it's a mix. If a private equity fund sells a portfolio of company and distributes the proceeds within a quarter that comes into NII for this quarter. If at the end of the quarter, those proceeds are still in the fund, that doesn't come into NII, until we receive the financial statements from the fund.","So if you carve-out distributions, and this year they've been responsible for the minority of private equity fund NII, there is a lag in terms of written up values. I know people ask us, maybe you to try to project. But with 75 sponsors, 200 funds and 3000 portfolio of companies, we probably couldn't come up with something that was even meaningful to us, much less something we ventured a share.","So we probably can't offer much guidance on what the next quarter ought to look like.","Alan Schnitzer","Hey, Josh, let me just go back to your question on BI underlying. And there is a - it seems implied to your question that you're looking at our outlook or explanation of prior periods and thinking about that as a forecast for a particular quarter. We are not giving the outlook information to try to give you guidance on any particular quarter. We're just trying to give as much help as we can on the general trends, as best as management can see it and interpret it and what those trends are and how they're influencing margins over the forward year.","We identified the large losses last year, because that was an outlier. And in this quarter, it just so happens that those return to a more normal level - more normal level. But there are other factors that are going to impact this business from time to time. There is going to non-cat weather. We had that this quarter. We told you that was about 1 point. There are base year changes. There are premium adjustments. There are all sorts of things that in any particular quarter could impact the result.","So I would just caution you, in terms of the way you use that outlook in terms of an expectation that it's guidance.","Josh Shanker","So then, I mean, just that I want to get off to my next question. But do you feel that you're about - margins are about stable on where they were in your mind a year ago, generally trying to adjust for all these items?","Alan Schnitzer","I mean, I don't think backwards. I think forwards. So we are where we are. We think there is an elevation of a 100 basis points of non-cat weather. And we've given you in the outlook as best we can where we think it's going to go.","Josh Shanker","Well, good luck with the future. Thank you very much.","Alan Schnitzer","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.","Larry Greenberg","Hi, thank you. And actually my questions have been answered. But just one other thought. And why not just use the PCS definition or allocation of catastrophe losses in your own cat definition, which, I don't know, might not do anything for you guys internally, but probably just would help with communication with the investment community and probably doesn't eliminate the non-cat discussion completely, but probably reduces a bit, any thoughts on that?","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah, it's certainly a topic that - yeah, sure, it's a topic that we certainly debate among ourselves all the time. We created the convention that we had, I don't know, probably in 2002 or something like that or maybe even before that. And the theory behind it was there is going to be some level of weather losses that ought to be stable and relatively predictable. And then you have things that are more severe that aren't.","And obviously, particularly, more recently, we've seen a lot more volatility in that, call it, working layer of weather. So I don't know if we'll do it or if we won't do it. But we appreciate the comment and we have thought about it and continue to think about it from time to time.","Larry Greenberg","Great. Thank you.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.","Meyer Shields","Great. Thanks. Two quick questions. First, I guess, last quarter you talked about pricing within domestic BI excluding workers' compensation at 3.6 points. And I was wondering whether you could give us an update for the third quarter.","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah, we gave that last quarter. It was relevant. We hadn't intended to give it going forward. There is some competitive sensitivity to giving that on an ongoing basis. But having said that, and having given to you last quarter, I don't think we would intend to give it going forward. But I'll tell you, that also take down a few tenths of a point. But again, I'll point you back to the RPC of 5, which if you think about that 5 in a historical context that's a very strong number. And, well, I'm not going to quantify it. But the RPC ex-workers' comp is even higher than that, so hopefully a couple of helpful data-points.","Meyer Shields","No, that is helpful. Second question, I was hoping you could dig a little bit into what observation drove the commercial auto reserve charge?","Alan Schnitzer","As we indicated, it was severity in recent accident years. And we can speculate on some of what the causal factors might be and whether that's inexperienced drivers or higher density on the roads given the - I mean, we can give you some factors that we could all read about. I mean, the fact of the matter is it's hard to isolate it to one or two things that we can pull out of our data and say that it's this.","It's a line that's been challenged from a profitability perspective for a while. We've known about that. We've been pricing for it. We've gotten, I don't know, over couple of years cumulatively 20 points or rate or something like that. So we're trying to get ahead of it. But it's hard to get to the causal factor. And if we can analogize to PI auto, we've seen some fluctuations in frequency and severity there. And sometimes those are explainable and sometimes they're not. We can speculate about some things. But I wouldn't know exactly what to point to, to tell you what it is.","Meyer Shields","Okay, great. Thank so much.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jay Cohen","Yes, thank you. Most of my questions are answered as well. I guess, just on the Amazon relationship, I mean, this is such a massive platform. And I know what you're talking about now is relatively modest for travelers. But was there any discussion around a broader product offering on their platform? Was auto thought about at all as far as being on that platform as well?","Gregory Toczydlowski","Yeah, Jay, I think - again, I would stick with we're very excited about what we've done with Amazon, and not get into speculating on what other opportunities might exist there. We're really focused on making the most of the relationship we've established here, again, for us, for our customers. And importantly, because I - and I keep emphasizing this, because I think it's gotten lost a little bit in the rhetoric, but importantly, creating opportunities for our agents and brokers to take advantage of it with their customers as well.","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah, Jay, we love the question and we are very enthusiastic about it. I think we're a little bit hesitant to give any further insight into the way we're thinking about it strategically beyond what we've said.","Jay Cohen","Certainly shows you guys are being first movers in this, so it is pretty exciting.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Zaremski","Hey, thanks for taking my question. I want to focus on personal auto for a minute. It feels like the year-to-date accident year combined ratio is kind of back where you want it to be. I don't know if you'd agree with that. I know you mentioned frequency was better than you expected. Maybe you could provide some color on whether it's kind of maybe back to its long-term negative trend and you are maybe being conservative.","And then, along the same lines, I don't get the sense you guys are - are we going to start growing that line or - but maybe I'm wrong, because you've been growing homeowners at a nice clip, but auto is kind of been in a maintenance mode.","Gregory Toczydlowski","Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. I think as we've been talking about the auto. The auto strategy at the top-level has shifted from reduced growth and manage profitability to balance growth and profitability. So we have shifted a bit in our mindset there. We are very pleased with the results year to date. And as I indicated, expect will be within our target combined ratio range for the year, which is ahead of schedule.","Most of that is driven by the pricing and underwriting actions that we've taken. Some of it is driven by better-than-expected frequency that we've seen. I think for all the reasons that Alan just outlined in the commercial auto discussion, so that we're cautious about our outlook on frequency. But one of the drivers of the improvement has been frequency has been a bit better than we expected for a little while now.","And so, we're cautiously factoring that experience into our outlook. And I would say cautiously optimistic. And again, you can see our outlook for pricing and for margins in the line in the outlook section as we spike it out there for you. But really pleased with where we are with auto and looking forward to taking it forward from here.","Michael Zaremski","Okay, great. And one last follow-up on the fixed investment income guidance for 2019 and the outlook, it seems like it's about a 5% increase in the run rate. I know there is a lot of moving parts here. But premiums are growing mid-single-digits. Interest rates have moved higher. So just maybe there are some moving parts I'm not appreciating. It seems like it is conservative.","Dan Frey","I think - it's Dan. If you think - I think if you look at the run rate that we're on and the fact that the interest rate environment should continue to improve modestly. And we're modestly growing the level of premiums. I think that trajectory makes a pretty good amount of sense that fixed income portfolio is a fairly predictable number. We've been giving you that type of guidance for the last several quarters. And I think we've been coming in pretty close to that guidance.","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah, in the outlook section, I think we give you the driving factors. And we can take the - we can take it offline.","Michael Zaremski","Okay. Thank you very much.","Alan Schnitzer","Right, [hope you'll get them out] [ph]. Thank you.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to the presenters for closing remarks.","Abbe Goldstein","Yeah, thank you very much for joining us this morning.

Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.","Abbe Goldstein","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our fourth quarter 2018 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplements and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our Web site at travelers.com, under the Investors section.","Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, CFO; and our three segment Presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance, who is joining us remotely this morning; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we look back on 2018, we are pleased that we improved returns, grew our business, and delivered strong underlying underwriting profitability and investment results, while returning significant excess capital to shareholders and taking great care of our customers.","Our results benefited from ongoing strategic initiatives geared toward creating top line opportunities and improving productivity and efficiency. Of course our results were also impacted by a high level of catastrophe losses.","Fourth quarter net income of $621 million or $2.32 per diluted share generated a return on equity of 10.9%. Core income was $571 million or $2.13 per diluted share and core return on equity was 10%. Net and core income were both impacted by almost $500 million of after-tax CAT losses.","Our full-year core income increased by 19% to $2.4 billion, generating core return on equity of 10.7%. The fact that we were able to generate this level of profit and profitability with $1.4 billion in after-tax CAT losses speaks to the earnings power of our franchise.","Our consolidated underlying combined ratio for the fourth quarter improved to 91.1%, the lowest level since the first quarter of 2016, even after the impact on the quarter of a full-year worth of higher loss estimates in the commercial auto line, driven by bodily injury severity.","Commercial auto has been a challenge for the industry and for us for some time and our most recent data reflects further deterioration. Greg will address more detail of what we've seen and how we\u2019re responding. For the full-year, a record earned premium of more than $27 billion and productivity and efficiency initiatives contributed to an after-tax underlying underwriting gain of $1.5 billion, the highest in more than a decade.","Our successful and consistent investment strategy also contributed to our results. After-tax net investment income was up 15% for the quarter and 12% for the year. The underwriting gain in investment income also reflects the benefit of tax reform. These results together with our strong balance sheet enable us to grow adjusted book value per share by 5% during the year after returning more than $2.1 billion of excess capital to shareholders, consistent with our long-standing capital management strategy.","Turning to production, we remain very pleased with our performance in the market with each of our business segments contributing to a 4% increase in net written premium for the quarter. For the year we grew net written premiums by 6% to a record $27.7 billion.","Net written premiums and business insurance in the quarter increased by nearly $100 million or 3% driven by historically high retention and positive renewal premium change. In our middle market business, retention reached a record fourth quarter high of 88%.","We completed the rollout of our business centers in our commercial accounts business during the year. All eligible renewals in new business are now flowing to these centers, freeing up our local underwriters to spend more time with our agent and broker partners.","For the year, commercial accounts delivered its highest level of new business in more than a decade. Renewal premium change in business insurance, including pure rate and exposure, was nearly 5% in the quarter, up over half a point compared to the same period last year and steady throughout 2018. We achieved positive renewal premium change in all lines.","In our Bond & Specialty business, net written premiums increased by 8% for the quarter with continued strong production in both our management liability and surety businesses. In Domestic Management Liability, we achieved record retention and new business for the full-year.","In Personal Insurance, net written premium growth in the quarter was strong at 5% with both our agency auto and homeowners businesses contributing. Two years ago, in 2016, we had a $4 billion book of agency auto business was in profitability challenges. Today, it's a $5 billion business that meets our return expectations. Thanks to impressive execution by the team and an improved environment, we got there ahead of schedule. We will hear more shortly from Greg, Tom, and Michael about our segment results.","To wrap it up, despite another year of elevated catastrophe losses, we achieved an 11% return on equity. That speaks to excellent underwriting execution and management of risk and reward across a diverse portfolio of businesses, our successful investment strategy, and our active approach to capital management. It also speaks to the dedication and commitment of our 30,000 employees.","With the talented team, competitive advantages that set us apart and an ambitious innovation agenda, along with a very high respect for our shareholders capital, we remain very well positioned to continue to deliver leading results and meaningful shareholder value over time.","And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Frey","Thank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $571 million, down from $633 million in the prior year quarter and core ROE was 10%, down from 11.1%. The decrease in both measures from last year's fourth quarter resulted primarily from a higher level of catastrophe losses and a lower level of favorable prior year reserve development.","Underlying results were strong as the consolidated underlying combined ratio of 91.1%, which excludes the impacts of CATs and PYD, improved by 1.3 points from the prior year quarter. Recall that last year's fourth quarter underlying combined ratio was elevated by about half a point as a result of tax planning actions taken at that time.","Our fourth quarter results include $610 million of pre-tax CAT losses, driven by $453 million from the California wildfires in November and $158 million from hurricane Michael in October. Last year's fourth quarter CAT losses of $499 million included favorable development of $157 million, primarily related to the hurricanes from the third quarter of 2017.","PYD in the current quarter for which I will provide more detail shortly was net favorable $167 million pre-tax, down from $293 million in the prior year quarter. Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $578 million improved by 22% from $472 million in the prior year quarter as increases in both Bond & Specialty and personal insurance were partially offset by a decrease in business insurance which Greg will address in his comments.","Pre-tax net investment income increased by 5% from the prior year quarter to $630 million as increases in fixed income were partially offset by lower pre-tax returns in our non-fixed income portfolio compared to very strong performance in the prior year quarter.","Fixed income results benefited from the more favorable interest rate environment and an increase in average invested assets resulting from continued growth in net written premiums. After-tax NII increased by 15% to $535 million benefiting from the lower U.S corporate income tax rate.","After-tax fixed income NII in the fourth quarter increased by $65 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and we expect that 2019 fixed income NII will increase by approximately $20 million to $25 million per quarter compared to the corresponding periods of 2018, as we projected both the average level of invested assets and the average yield on the portfolio will be higher.","All three segments experienced net favorable prior year reserve development in the fourth quarter. In Personal Insurance, recent accident years performed better-than-expected in the auto book. In Bond & Specialty, we experienced better-than-expected loss development in the management liability book. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $48 million pre-tax was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in domestic workers comp, which was largely offset by unfavorable development in commercial auto and to a lesser extent general liability.","Commercial auto unfavorable PYD in the quarter was $155 million pre-tax resulting from elevated severity in recent accident years. In General Liability were the return remain attractive, unfavorable PYD in the quarter reflected changes across several accident years in business units. There is no broad theme with the largest impact related to a small number of claims from older years in our runoff book.","For the full-year, despite the adverse changes in commercial auto and the third quarter asbestos charge, net favorable prior year reserve development was $517 million pre-tax. When our combined 2018 Schedule P is filed early in the second quarter, we expected to show that excluding asbestos and environmental, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favorably or had minor unfavorable development except for commercial auto and as a result of the change in commercial auto accident year 2017.","Page 19 of the webcast provides information about our January 1 CAT Treaty renewal. Our corporate CAT aggregate XOL treaty renewed on terms in line with the expiring treaty and continues to provide coverage for both single CAT events and the aggregation of losses from multiple CAT events. As you all know, the industry has experienced an elevated level of catastrophe losses in recent years. In response, we have updated our actuarial models to reflect the actual results of recent years and to give more weight to recent years when determining our view of normal expectations.","As a result, we\u2019ve recognized somewhat higher level of expected losses in our pricing and underwriting models. In further recognition of recent weather activity and ongoing uncertainty for 2019, we have also added a new catastrophe aggregate XOL treaty as described on Slide 19. This treaty addresses qualifying PCS designated events in North America for which we incur losses of $5 million or more providing aggregate coverage of $430 million part of $500 million of losses above an aggregate retention of $1.3 billion. Hurricane and earthquake events have a $250 million per occurrence cap.","We believe this new treaty provides a reasonable level of protection at an appropriate price. In terms of the accounting, there will be an impact on the underlying combined ratio in 2019 due to the effect of seated premiums on total net earned premiums.","Since the majority of any loss recoveries from this treaty will likely benefit our net catastrophe losses, which are excluded from underlying results, we expect about a half a point impact on the full-year underlying combined ratio, but a minimal impact on the full-year total combined ratio because the attachment point is $1.3 billion, we also expect that any recoveries would likely be recorded in the second half of the year and accordingly the impact on the combined ratio will likely be more pronounced in the early part of 2019. Of course the actual effect on our total combined ratio for 2019 will be impacted by the level of PCS events we experience.","Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $948 million were again very strong, all our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.4 billion. Interest rates decreased modestly during the fourth quarter and accordingly our net unrealized investment loss narrowed from $447 million after-tax as of September 30 to $113 million after-tax at year-end.","Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses with $87.27 at year-end, 5% higher than at the beginning of the year. We returned $375 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $170 million and dividends of $205 million. For the year, we returned more than $2.1 billion of capital to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases.","Consistent with our capital management strategy that level of return capital takes into consideration a variety of factors. For example, the increased level of capital in support of the nearly $2.8 billion of premium growth we have generated over the last two years, the amount of earnings and contributions to the pension plan and you'll recall that we made a $200 million contribution in September for tax planning purposes.","And with that, I will turn the microphone over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance.","Gregory Toczydlowski","Thanks, Dan. For the fourth quarter, Business Insurance produced $391 million of segment income, down from $637 million in the prior year quarter, bringing the full-year total to $1.64 billion, a 2% increase over 2017. Earnings for both the quarter and the year included the relatively high levels of catastrophe losses that Alan and Dan mentioned, as was the case in 2017.","Earnings for both the quarter and the year were positively impacted by strong profitability in workers' comp, our biggest product line as well as higher overall business volumes that resulted from recent earned premium growth and increased operating leverage that has reduced our expense ratio.","Earnings were negatively impacted by a fourth quarter after-tax charge of about $195 million or about $245 million on a pre-tax basis related to higher commercial auto bodily injury loss activity. Of that amount, about $155 million pre-tax reduced net favorable prior year reserve development. The remaining $90 million pre-tax represents the impact of the 2018 accident year and incorporates reestimations for the first three quarters of the year.","The corresponding combined ratio impacts were approximately 6.5 points on the segment combined ratio for the quarter and a little more than 1.5 points on the segment combined ratio for the year. The impacts on the underlying combined ratio from the adverse auto adjustments were approximately 2.5 points for the quarter and a little more than a half a point for the full-year.","As we\u2019ve discussed with you, in recent years we've reacted to higher commercial auto losses, a different portion of our Commercial Auto Book through various pricing, underwriting and reserving actions. But during the recent quarter, data emerge that changed our view of the overall loss environment broadly across our commercial auto book. We saw more of an increase in the rate of attorney involvement than we had anticipated and a lengthening in the claim development pattern.","As a consequence, we're experiencing a higher level of bodily injury severity than we anticipated. Because we believe the factors we're experiencing are environmental, our primary plan of action going forward will be to push for more rate. As we mentioned in the past, the auto line is where we've been getting the most rate over the last couple of years, but we need more of it.","It is important to remember that auto is typically part of an account solution for a business insurance customers. We generally provide them with some combination of workers comp, property, general liability and\/or other coverages. Accordingly, we will use our extensive data and analytics capabilities on an account by account basis to improve auto profitability as the line and as part of the overall profitability of our product portfolio.","Turning back to the segment results, the underlying combined ratio of 95.4% for the quarter was 1.5 points higher than in the prior year. The loss ratio was about 3 points higher than last year, driven by the 2.5 points from auto. The remaining half a point is due to higher non-weather loss activity in our international businesses with the largest contributor to that coming from Lloyd's, partially offset by favorable variability in domestic loss activity.","The expense ratio for the quarter improved by 1.5 points with about half of that improvement coming from lower expense dollars and the other half coming from higher premium volumes. As always, there are fluctuations in expenses from quarter-to-quarter, so we pointed the full-year expense ratio as a better indication of our run rate. All in for the year, a 95.7 underlying combined ratio, which included large losses which ran about a point over what we would have view as a more normal level.","Turning to top line in production, net written premium growth for the quarter was 3%, bringing the full-year total to $15 billion, almost $700 million or 5% higher than in 2017. We are pleased with our continued progress with our strategic initiatives and we remain encouraged with the feedback from our agent and broker partners that were focused on the right priorities.","In terms of domestic production, we achieved strong renewal premium change of 4.8% in the quarter with renewal rate change of 1.6%, while retention remained high at 85%, a reflection of the quality of our book. New business of $488 million was up 3% from a year-ago. We are pleased with these production results and continue to operate at a granular level of executing in our marketplace strategy to meet our return objective with a thoughtful balance towards retaining our best business, improving pricing where it's needed and pursuing attractive new business opportunities.","Turning to the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change and renewal rate ticked up a bit, while retention remained strong at 82%. New business was up 11% over the prior year quarter as we continue to leverage our investments in technology and workflow initiatives. In middle market, renewal premium change was 4.5% with renewal rate change consistent with last quarter at 1.5%, while retention remained historically high at 88%. As Alan said, a record for the fourth quarter.","New business premiums of $281 million were down a bit from a strong level in the prior year quarter. And our core commercial accounts business where our business center initiatives are now fully rolled out, new business was up 17% for the quarter, while full-year new business premiums of $561 million were at the highest level in over a decade. In this business, we are pleased that the business centers and our strategic investments are having the intended impact. Submission and quote activity are both up from the prior year creating attractive top line opportunities.","To sum up, we feel terrific about our execution in the marketplace and confident about how our position going forward. Before I turn the call over to Tom to talk about Bond & Specialty results, I want to comment on our outlook for RPC and the underlying combined ratio since we will not be filing our 10-K for a few weeks.","We expect RPC will remain positive in 2019 and at the levels broadly consistent with 2018. We expect the underlying combined ratio for the full-year 2019 will be lower than in 2018, which assumes that large losses primarily in the property line return to lower and more normal levels. Underneath that full-year outlook, we expect the underlying combined ratio improvements to come in the second through fourth quarters of the year.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas Kunkel","Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered another quarter of strong returns and growth. Segment income of $220 million nearly doubled from the prior year quarter due primarily to higher underlying underwriting income and a higher level of net favorable prior year development. The improvement in underlying income reflects the impact of a single surety loss in the prior year quarter and higher business volumes. The underlying combined ratio was an excellent 78.1%.","Net written premiums for the quarter were up 8%, driven by strong growth in our Management Liability business and solid surety production that was up slightly from the very strong prior year quarter. In our Domestic Management Liability business, our focus continues to be on retaining our high quality business and targeting rate were needed, while pursuing attractive new business opportunities. So we are pleased that retention remained very strong at 89% for the quarter with the renewal premium change of 3.9 points.","New business of $53 million was up 8% from the prior year quarter. These results reflect our extensive competitive advantages and solid marketplace execution. We are a leading franchise in our specialty markets with long-term customer agent and broker relationships across a national footprint. We've got exceptional talent and specialized industry expertise, extensive data and advanced analytics.","And while we have leading platforms and robust products, we continue to invest in strategic product, marketing and technology capabilities that will further extend our competitive advantages. So Bond & Specialty results were excellent. We continue to feel great about our growth, returns and the opportunities that our strong market positions and competitive advantages present for the future.","In terms of our 2019 outlook as compared to 2018, we expect RPC for our Domestic Management Liability business to remain positive and broadly consistent and for the segment, the underlying combined ratio to be broadly consistent. For Surety, we expect 2019 net written premium to be slightly higher than it was in 2018. Due to the inherent lumpiness in surety production, going forward, we will no longer be including surety net written premium in our outlook disclosure.","And now, I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.","Michael Klein","Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance for the quarter, segment income was $32 million, an improvement of $82 million over the prior year quarter and our combined ratio of 102.6% improved 6.1 points. The Lower combined ratio was driven by improved auto results, lower catastrophes and higher net favorable prior year reserve development.","For the full-year, segment income of $297 million and a combined ratio of 100.6% are also better than the prior year, driven by the same factors I referenced for the quarter. Net written premium growth for the fourth quarter and full-year was 5% and 7%, respectively. Our premium growth helped us achieve a 30 basis point improvement in our expense ratio for the full-year.","Agency Automobile delivered another impressive quarter with a combined ratio of 95.3%, down 7.7 points from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by a lower underlying combined ratio. Underlying margins continue to improve due to earned pricing exceeding loss trend and frequency remaining better-than-expected. These factors also resulted in favorable full-year loss adjustments in the quarter that further contributed to a better loss ratio than we would have expected.","The quarter also benefited from higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by higher catastrophes. Recall that the prior year quarter included a benefit from the re-estimation of catastrophes including hurricane Harvey. Our full-year combined ratio for Agency Automobile of 94.2% was 10 points better than the prior year and returns were well within target on both an overall and an underlying basis.","In light of these improvements, we continue to moderate renewal premium changes in this line as we seek to balance growth and profitability. In Agency Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 109.8% improved by more than 5 points, despite three significant catastrophes; The Camp and Woolsey wildfires in California and hurricane Michael.","On an underlying basis, the combined ratio was 72.5% or 2.3 points higher than the prior year quarter driven by continued elevation in non-weather-related losses, which we noted in the prior quarter. The full-year combined ratio of 105.6% reflects the second consecutive year of very high catastrophe losses, which again accounted for approximately 24 points of the combined ratio.","The full-year 2018 underlying combined ratio was 81.6%, 4.5 points higher than 2017 driven by higher levels of non-catastrophe weather and non-weather loss activity. Consistent with comments we made earlier this year, given this recent catastrophe and the non-catastrophe loss experience, and our assumption that some of this elevated loss pressure will persist, we continue to implement granular pricing and underwriting actions to manage our exposure and improve results.","Turning to quarterly production, our agency automobile retention remained at a solid 84%, while renewal premium change of 6.3% continue to moderate consistent with our objectives and new business was up 2% from the prior year quarter. In Agency Homeowners and Other, we remain pleased with our momentum. Renewal premium change was 3.9%, nearly a point higher than a year-ago. In addition, we delivered 6% growth in policies in force, and strong retention of 86% and a 17% increase in new business.","Turning to our outlook for full-year 2019, we expect renewal premium changes for agency automobile to be positive, but lower compared to 2018, while renewal premium changes for Agency Homeowners and Other should be positive and higher compared to 2018. We expect the underlying combined ratio to be broadly consistent in Agency Automobile, Agency Homeowners and Other, and for the Personal Insurance segment compared to 2018. This underlying combined ratio outlook includes the impact of the catastrophe aggregate reinsurance treaty that Dan mentioned earlier.","In the outlook section of our 10-K, we will provide some quarterly texture underneath our full-year underlying combined ratio expectations as quarter-to-quarter comparisons will likely vary throughout the year. All in for the segment, in light of the improved results in auto and the actions we're undertaking in Homeowners, we are pleased with our position and with the opportunity to profitably grow the business, while continuing to invest in new capabilities and explore innovative opportunities in an ever-changing marketplace.","With that, I will turn the call back over Abbe.","Abbe Goldstein","Thank you, Michael. And with that, we\u2019re ready to open-up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. First I wanted to touch based on the California wildfires. Can you give us some more perspective on how you compare your 2018 exposure to 2017 and whether you feel theirs is still type of public policy solution that needs to be addressed here given the annual major exposure for the industry?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes. Michael, you want to start?","Michael Klein","Yes, I mean, I will start with just sort of the view of the exposure and Jay may be give you a little bit of a view into a little more detail underneath what we\u2019d mean when we talk about granular underwriting and pricing actions in response. So as we look at California wildfire, it's clearly two significant years in a row of losses I think, the discussion and the debate about the environment is pretty broad and pretty public. In terms of our response, we look at a handful of things. First, we look at our underwriting appetite and our view on terms and conditions in the marketplace and we have taken action. We had already taken action in 2017 to begin to restrict our new business underwriting appetite. We've implemented further action that will take effect later on this quarter in 2018 to further restrict that new business underwriting appetite and also to instill new business underwriting procedures for example further inspections around defensible space as an example that will again sort of tighten our new business underwriting appetite. We've also discussed with the Department of Insurance in California and begun to implement some nonrenewal action in the State of California to address some of the more significant wildfire exposures in the portfolio. And we\u2019re also in discussions with the department about a filing to increase prices for homeowners in California. So that gives you a little bit of texture underneath our response to wildfires in particular in the homeowners book.","Jay Gelb","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. My second question was on the pace of share buybacks in the quarter. So if I look back over the past six quarters, the average quarterly buyback is around $385 million, which was much higher than the $170 million in the fourth quarter. So, I'm just trying to figure out if fourth quarter lower pace of buybacks was due to the elevated CAT losses, or if there's some other factors going on that we should take into account when we project buybacks in the years ahead?","Dan Frey","Yes, Jay, it's Dan. I will take that. So really no change in our underlying philosophy. It's a consistent approach to capital management and to look at any one quarters worth of buybacks is probably a difficult way to look at it we think about it more over time as you would -- as you suggested and it would be true in the fourth quarter given the magnitude and the uncertainty related to the California wildfires, we did pull back a little bit on this level of share repurchase. But if you look at 2018 as a whole, we generated $2.4 billion of core income, we returned a little bit more than $2.1 billion through dividend and share buybacks and remember we made an additional $200 million contribution of the pension plan at the end of the third quarter. So really no change there. We are going to look at what level of capital we think we need to support the business, our projected levels of earnings going forward and the cash needs that we have for things like the pension plan and react accordingly. So what we buyback in shares is going to be an outcome of those things not really an objective of in and itself.","Jay Gelb","Makes a lot of sense. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elyse from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Good morning. My first question just going to the business insurance, the underlying margin outlook for 2019. So if I go through some of your prepared remarks, you guys pointed to about 1 point above normal level of large losses in '18 with an offset partially there from that coming back of the additional aggregate reinsurance cover that you guys are purchasing. Now I know that\u2019s 50 basis points overall, I\u2019m not sure if you can go into the specific details within business insurance as we think about the margin improvement this coming year. And then as you set the margin outlook, are you guys assuming commercial auto gets better or worse when compared to how you guys ended up booking that business in accident year 2018?","Alan Schnitzer","Elyse, good morning. It's Alan. So let me start and Greg you can jump in. So, we try not to get too quantitative on these outlooks. We try to keep it qualitative. There's a lot of estimates, a lot of judgments and a lot of things from period-to-period that are going to cause volatility. So we try to give you a order of magnitude and direction. Having said that, Greg did point out the -- essentially one point of property large losses that we would expect to return to more normal level. We do expect to address Commercial Auto over time, but a significant improvement in that is not otherwise reflected in the outlook for margins. And the overall impact of the new CAT Treaty on the BI underlying is relatively small. So I think in broad strokes that gives you sort of the way to think about the underlying outlook.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. And then my second question in terms of thinking about the pricing on outlook, you guys pointed to fairly stable renewal premium change this -- in 2019. So when you think about price versus exposure, can you give us a little bit of color of how you\u2019re seeing potentially picking up seeing the different components? And then in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s when we kind of annualize really the uptick in rates that we saw in 2017 following on the record CAT losses, did you see anything different in the market as we started to annualize some of that price that would be needed to think maybe the push for price will go one way or the other in 2019?","Alan Schnitzer","You know between the CAT activity, Elyse, and one reinsurance renewals, we will all see together over time how that pricing plays out. We are not going to get anymore granular on the outlook than what we have in the outlook section that will be in the 10-K and that Greg shared. Overall, I would say that about 5 points of rate changes -- of price changes is pretty good change, if you look back at just the history of price change in BI a plus 5 would be in that historical context pretty good. And we've seen relatively stable allocation of that between exposure and rate. And so we feel pretty good about that overall.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the color.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Zaremski","Hey, thanks. First question regards to the expense ratio improvement story. Would you say this is -- this will be -- is this in its early innings and could this be kind of a multiyear trend? It seems to have picked up in the second half of the year in terms of the improvement?","Alan Schnitzer","Well, what\u2019s definitely ongoing for us is the thoughtful and disciplined management of both productivity and efficiency as a strategic effort, and that goes across the entire company everything we do. So you will see more activity from us in that regard. In terms of how it's going to come through in the numbers, you may or may not see that in the expense ratio. We\u2019ve been saying for a while that our objective here is to create incremental operating leverage and we think that's very helpful to us, but really in the sense that it gives us a lot of flexibility. We can let that fall to the bottom line in the form of a lower expense ratio. We can take those savings and reinvest it into important strategic initiatives or we can decide to put it into price without compromising our return objective. So it's definitely an ongoing objective for us across the company. I think Greg gave you a sense of what a run rate is for BI and I don\u2019t know, you want to -- Dan?","Dan Frey","Yes, and for the enterprise I'd say similarly if you look at the full-year expense ratio, that's a pretty good indication of where we\u2019re probably heading going forward. It has improved quite a bit over the last couple of years. I think we\u2019ve reached a level that we're more happy with. As Alan said, we will continue to focus on productivity and efficiency, but I wouldn't expect to see a continued level of dramatic decrease in the expense ratio from the levels we\u2019re at now.","Michael Zaremski","Okay, great. And my last follow-up question is in regards to worker's comp were margins remain healthy. If we think about work comp pricing, does that expected to become more or less of a headwind as 2019 progresses? And then maybe you could also update us on loss costs trends in comp? Thanks.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, workers' comp it's been under some pricing pressure, but completely rational of given where the profitability of the line has been. We are not going to breakout pricing outlook by line. We give it you for the segment, but the profitability continues to be good. And generally speaking, we would expect continued pressure in the comp line. We\u2019ve got no change in commentary on workers' comp loss trend from what we shared with you last quarter, which is to say that we -- frequency and severity are -- those are selections, those are picks for us that go into loss ratios. And then data comes in over time and you look at reported activity over time and we compare that to what your selections are and decide if there's anything you're seeing that requires you to move off that. And as we shared last quarter and we would reiterate again, we're not seeing anything in the data that causes us to move off our loss picks.","Michael Zaremski","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. My first question on these sort of new aggregate reinsurance program. So how much your CAT loss would be in 2017 to '18, if these program is applied retroactively?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, Kai. So we looked at modeling what things would look like going back a number of years and in particular over the last two years, probably not surprisingly given the elevated level of CATs, we'd have seen a full recovery under the treaty in each of the last two years.","Kai Pan","Is that -- so is it safe to assume like your core loss ratio will be 50 basis points higher given -- aggregate cover, but your normalized CAT loss would be 50 basis point lower going forward?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t say that it's an exact offset. I think if you go back to my comments, it's definitely about a half a point on the underlying combined ratio with the mitigating factor on the overall normal CAT expectation to get us back to pretty de minimis impact on the combined ratio all in, if we had a normal year of CATs which as you know in the last seven years we haven't.","Kai Pan","Okay. In other word, if the CATs we see are coming lighter than your normal, you actually -- the lost combined ratio will be worse than in the normal year?","Alan Schnitzer","The combined ratio would be worse because we would have exceeded a way premiums and had no recovery, correct.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. My second question on personal line side. And your prior guidance for 2019 was improvements in the underlying margin in both homeowners as well as auto book. Michael just gave like guidance for 2000 -- new guide in 2019, pretty much consistent with 2018. Is that because 2018 actually improved better than you were previously expected, or you are reinvesting in the business for growth?","Michael Klein","Sure, Kai. It's Michael. I think it's -- so it's actually a little bit of both, right. If you think about auto, auto came in better than we expected and so the broadly consistent outlook just reflects the update of the actual results compared to the outlook. On the property side, it's a little bit of a change in the outlook. Again, we've been talking about catastrophes and non-catastrophe weather and non-weather loss experience and talking about the fact that we continue to put more weight on more recent periods as Dan mentioned. And so the broadly consistent outlook for property is partly a reflection of that as well as the impact of the accounting of the new CAT ag treaty, which as Dan just talked about is a drag on underlying and, in particular, impacts the property line. So those are kind of the pieces.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. Well, thank you so much.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning. Maybe just a couple of quick questions for Michael Klein. Number one, if you go back, I guess, to Allen's opening remarks, it seems like a lot of the work which was needed in Personal Auto has been done and I think here the comment was that we got their ahead of expectations. Maybe just update us on the loss cost trend environment out there and maybe the trajectory of rate filings?","Michael Klein","Sure, Amit. So I think loss cost trend fairly consistent with what we've talked about, right? We see continued severity trend particularly in collision and physical damage, increased cost to repair vehicles, and again, many of those dynamics we see has been relatively consistent with what we would've talked about a quarter ago. There has been some commentary about a little bit less pressure on bodily injury lost cost trend in the environment. Again, I think when you put it all together and combine it with our view on frequency, I'd say it's consistent with Alan's comments earlier of we have a pick, we observe results and we sort of see most of that as variation around the loss cost trend we've estimated and so don't see a significant change in our loss trend outlook there. In terms of outlook for price change going forward, again, our RPC outlook for auto is that RPC will remain positive, but be lower in 2019 than it was in 2018.","Amit Kumar","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. The only other question I had was on the press release on lift. And I think lift has $1.4 million or so drivers. And I was curious if you could just maybe broadly talk about this opportunity, how we should -- we as outsiders should sort of handicap this going forward? Thanks.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes. Amit, on lift we think it's an exciting opportunity for us to participate in the changing economy. It's a service offering for them. We wouldn't expect from an economic perspective for it to meaningfully move the numbers in the near-term, but it's a great partner and we're excited to work with them and excited to bring our leading claim capabilities to benefit for them.","Amit Kumar","And any thoughts on expanding into another TNCs down the road?","Alan Schnitzer","I don't -- we don\u2019t have anything to announce at the moment. We are always thinking about whether there are opportunities for us to participate in an evolving economy and we will continue to do that as we think about innovation and what insurance means in the changing world.","Amit Kumar","Got it. I will stop here. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Abbe Goldstein","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. A couple of quick questions here for you. First, just going back to the CAT loads or the CAT treaty that Tom was talking about. Is it a simple way to think about this kind of going forward, so we kind of assume a $1.3 billion CAT load for you guys? Is that kind of a good way to think about it?","Dan Frey","Brian, it's Dan. So I will say we don\u2019t give earnings guidance and so we won't give guidance on the specific pieces of the components that go into earnings. You could see historically we will disclose from time to time in the proxy what our expected level of catastrophes had been on sort of a backwards looking basis. We should take that number and probably think about it trending up over time for two reasons. One is we\u2019ve seen growth in the premium volume in the overall exposure level in the business, and two, as we mentioned in my comments, a little bit more weight on recent periods that gives us a bit of an uptick in terms of our view of each dollar of those premiums that would need to go into CAT. But I'm going to avoid given a specific number.","Brian Meredith","Got you. Great. And then my second question, I\u2019m just curious, you guys had really good strong growth, new business growth in your Select business, small commercial. I\u2019m just curious, does that have any pressure on your underlying loss ratios when you're seeing that type of new business growth?","Gregory Toczydlowski","Hey, Brian. This is Greg. Yes, in the Select business you can see the 11% new business growth year-over-year. We feel terrific about that growth. We've been spending quite a bit of investment in the technology in the workflow and the product management across all of the Select business. You can see that the quality of the book looks really good, really strong retentions in the 82, 83 range. So we haven't seen any meaningful deterioration in the underlying based on that new business.","Brian Meredith","Great. So it's really like in auto you'll see that 10 year impact, you don\u2019t get that in the small commercial?","Gregory Toczydlowski","Not as much just because you have the comp, you have the property, the GL and auto and [technical difficulty].","Brian Meredith","Makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous. Your line is open.","Ryan Tunis","Great. Thanks. Good morning. First question just for Alan. Looking at the 95.7 underlying combined ratio in business insurance, we factor in some elevated large loss activity, but then you throw in kind of a normal CAT load and 3 to 3.5 point range. It feels like we are running at a normalized level here at like 98%, which is only a 2% underwriting margin. That doesn\u2019t feel like a double-digit ROE. I\u2019m curious is this a level on the combined ratio where you'd be looking at kind of hold the line, if there's a place you should be thinking about -- little bit more of a sense of urgency around rate increases. Thanks.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, Ryan, I\u2019m not going to get into calculating those returns with you, but I -- but -- and clearly there's been some headwinds in pockets of BI, right. We talked about the commercial auto, we talked about large losses, we've -- Greg mentioned today some of the pressure outside the United States and the largest piece that come from Lloyd. So there are some aspects of that in which we would expect improvement over time, and we continue to get the 5 points of rate. So there are margin opportunities outside of the pure rate trend dynamic. Again, the BI large losses outside the U.S., commercial auto, that fixed income NII helps as those rates are where they are in the bond portfolio turns over. Again, you\u2019ve heard us talk about expense leverage, that's been pretty good. And just in terms of earnings dollars the volume helps us well. So we're not feeling badly at all about where the returns are on underlying basis and where they\u2019re trending. And if you take a step back and look at the whole company, Ryan, and -- you could do this math as well as we do, but if you take out prior year development and you put in wherever you think is normal for CATs, get a return that somewhere in the low double digits and given where the 10-year treasury is today. Again, that doesn't feel altogether bad to us, particularly with some opportunities we would see going forward and one of the benefits of having a company of this size is you got a diversified portfolio of businesses. So we always feel a sense of urgency around here. There's no question about that. We are at the heart of who we\u2019re optimizers and everything is not perfect, we\u2019re going to work with a sense of urgency to optimize it. But there's no sense at all here that that there are problems.","Gregory Toczydlowski","Ryan, one thing I would add. This is Greg, is when you do that math, keep in mind that we do have different combined ratio target, depending on what the net investment income is generated based on those product line. So think workers comp where we have the largest rate or we could run a higher combined ratio relative to a shorter tail line like property. So I would just ask you to keep that in mind also when you do that math.","Ryan Tunis","Understood. And then my follow-up is, I get the commercial auto to increase with the business is more lawyer involvement, but what\u2019s not completely clear to me as why that wouldn\u2019t translate this an elevated trend and the Other Liability line. So just curious what gives you guys comfort to do things you\u2019re seeing in auto or auto is specific and we shouldn\u2019t be seen more broadly general liability.","Dan Frey","Yes. So, Ryan, we certainly watch that carefully. And just walk you through the lines and our thinking on it. So you\u2019ve got GL large for a second, excess umbrella and I would put Management Liability in this group too. We already have very, very high levels of representation in those claims. So that's again already a high percentage RD pre-active there. On the smaller side, the GL small we are, we are seeing a little bit more of the attorney rep, but it doesn't seem to be quite as active as it is in the auto when -- we just speculate that's probably not as attractive of business opportunity for the plaintiffs bar, you've got a much more very portfolio of claims there, harder to make the case and many cases. So just -- it's just not as well hanging fruit at least for now. When you get into the really small when -- the liability component of CMP, again we have seen the pressure. This theme in other words does cross liability lines, but to a lesser degree than we see in auto.","Ryan Tunis","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.","Meyer Shields","Hi. Pardon me, I guess, is probably beating on a dead horse here, but when you discuss the impact on the core loss ratio from the commercial treaty that\u2019s completely separate from the one point of elevated large property losses. Do I have that right?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, two totally separate topics.","Meyer Shields","Okay. And second, the 50 basis point increase that you mentioned, that\u2019s not compared to 2018. That\u2019s compared to what 2019 would be otherwise, is that fair?","Alan Schnitzer","It is compared to what 2019 would otherwise have been, correct.","Meyer Shields","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.","Larry Greenberg","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just on investment income, wondering if there's anything to say about non-fixed income in the first quarter, given the volatility in equity markets and fixed income markets in the fourth quarter. And then, just given some of the spread widening that took place in the fourth quarter, have you done any asset reallocations given some of that volatility or what some might view as opportunity?","William Heyman","Hi, Larry. It's Bill Heyman. Let me take in reverse order. With respect to the second question, we haven't really changed our strategy, we regard increased spreads as you say is opportunity, assuming our credit judgment is good, which historically it has been. The -- as you know the yield on a 10-year treasury dropped from 3.06 at the end of the quarter to about 2.69 at the end of the year, its back up to about 2.75. So that's been partly compensated for by spread widening. So we are still pretty comfortable with what we're seeing out there. In returns of private equity, we occasionally make internal projections of what we think the portfolio will throw up and we've been notoriously inaccurate. We generally far too pessimistic. I agree that the developments in public equity markets in the fourth quarter taken alone wouldn\u2019t order well for 2019, but we've seen similar situations where developments like that have been followed by perfectly good years. So your guess is probably as good as ours.","Larry Greenberg","Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Your next question will come from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Yaron Kinar","Thanks for allowing to sneak one in. As we go back to business insurance and the underlying combined ratio there, so I think you said that you had about a 1% point of non-CAT, large losses in '18. I think that was roughly the same number that you had in '17, so if I look at the underlying combined ratio, it seems like there was a little bit of deterioration year-over-year. Maybe if I adjust for the commercial auto, it's flat to slightly worse. Can you maybe talk about what is driving that this year and then what gives you lead confidence that 2019 numbers will look better.","Gregory Toczydlowski","Hey, Yaron, this is Greg. Number one, you\u2019re correct that we do our best job possible of trying to normalize our large losses, and that\u2019s how we price and managed the business and we were over expectations in 2017 and as I disclosed in my prepared comments we are also over our normal expectations for 2018. That was roughly the one point.","Yaron Kinar","The difference and maybe a point to the full-year underlying combined ratio where you can see an 80 basis points difference between those, the full-year '17 and the full year '18. Then again in my prepared comments I mentioned auto driving a little bit more than half a point there. The international businesses is also driving above a little more than half a point and that's predominantly driven based on the Lloyd's business. And then we had some as I disclosed some favorable expense activity that offset some of that. So those are all the pieces that get to there.","Gregory Toczydlowski","So if you expect the expense ratio may be not improved to the same magnitude in '19. Can you still expect some improvement in '19 for the overall underlying combined ratio. Can you maybe talk about where that improvement would be coming from, given the current loss terms?","Alan Schnitzer","It's basically that one point of large losses.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Okay. And then maybe a quick one on the prior year development. It sounds from the scripted comments that the slowdown in that prior year development, favorable development was really driven by an increase in adverse development and not so much by maybe a decrease in gross favorable development. Is that fair?","Gregory Toczydlowski","Let me just start and I will queue it. The question almost implied that there is a trend in prior year development. There is no trend in prior development. Our obligation at the end of every quarters to come up with management's best estimate and we do that, and then every quarter we go through the process of reevaluating our returns and making adjustments where we feel like we need to. So in any for any given period, the level of prior year development is just a net of those adjustments to best estimates.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, I would echo that which is why I think we\u2019re pretty careful to always characterized and as net favorable prior year reserve development are net unfavorable prior reserve development, because there are business lines in accident years that go both ways. And if you step back and look at the full-year, a little more than $0.5 billion of pre-tax net favorable prior year reserve development. Not that big in the scheme of the balance sheet, if you look at the right side of the balance sheet you\u2019re seeing loss and loss of adjustment expense reserves of around $50 billion. So we are pretty good at estimating losses, but every quarter we are going to update and refine them.","Yaron Kinar","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Goldstein for closing remarks.","Abbe Goldstein","Thank you all for joining us today.

Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.","Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. And now, Jay Fishman.","Jay S. Fishman","Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Given Storm Sandy, we are very pleased to report fourth quarter net and operating income of $304 million and $278 million, respectively. For the full year, we reported $2.4 billion of operating income and operating return on equity of 11% and a 9.8% return on equity. Our financial and operational results for both the full year and the quarter were strong and demonstrate the success of the strategies we have implemented over the last few years.","In Business Insurance, excluding National Accounts, we continued to achieve meaningful positive rate gains of nearly 8% in the quarter, while retentions continued to remain stable and new business remained at only marginally lower levels.","Our Management Liability businesses have also produced similar pricing successes over the past year, achieving nearly 8% rate gains in the quarter. The operating environment for our businesses remains the same. Interest rates remain at historically low levels and weather patterns continue to be uncertain. Catastrophe losses this year totaled $1.2 billion after tax, making it another year with a very high level of catastrophe losses by historical standards. As such, we remain committed to our strategy of pursuing rate gains across all of our businesses in order to improve returns. We are particularly pleased with the rate gains we've achieved over the past 2 years and the compounding effect we are now recording.","In Personal Insurance, both our Home and Auto business were also significantly impacted by Storm Sandy. Notwithstanding that impact, we are especially pleased with our Agency Homeowners business, which produced a 96.4% combined ratio for the full year and a 78.7% underlying combined ratio for the year.","In our Agency Auto business, while we believe we are very much on the right path, we are not yet satisfied with our results. Our 99.2% underlying combined ratio for the year is not at a level that produces sufficient returns. As we have discussed previously since the fourth quarter of 2011, we have been experiencing an increase in auto severity, resulting in levels that have continue to exceed our expectations. But with the rate increases we have already achieved, earned rate gains exceeded our updated view of loss trend in the third and fourth quarters. In this regard, we are now achieving widening margins and we intend to continue this strategy. Assuming that we continue to achieve rate gains at this level, and the loss trend does not materially increase from current levels, this will result in improved underwriting profitability in the line. Brian will discuss this in more detail later.","Turning to capital management, we remain committed to our strategy of returning excess capital to shareholders. In that regard, we repurchased $400 million of stock in the quarter, bringing total capital return to shareholders in 2012 to over $2.1 billion, including $700 million of dividends. Since embarking on our long-term strategy of returning excess capital to shareholders in 2006, we have reduced our shares outstanding by $362 million or 52%.","Just another quick word on Sandy. The storm had a significant human impact on Travelers, as well as our customers and employees. We're extremely grateful to all the individuals who made personal sacrifices to help us deliver on the promise we extend with each one of our policies. Storm Sandy produced the largest number of claim notices in our history and even in this event, we were able to handle virtually all non-NFIP claims with our own adjusters. Just to give you a few highlights, in total, nearly 5,000 employees contributed to our response, we followed up with 80% of all claimants within 48 hours after their initial claim report and virtually 100% were recontacted within 72 hours and we paid or resolved approximately 90% of our Personal Insurance, non-NFIP claim estimates within 30 days of the first loss notice. These are really solid results that I was able to witness firsthand. Our claims group really makes us proud.","In closing, we remain very pleased with the ability to deliver rate improvements across all our segments and generate superior returns over time. We entered 2013 with a real sense of optimism based on the strength of our competitive position.","And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay S. Benet","Thanks, Jay. Let me begin by stating that, as always, we've maintained our strong cash position, ending the year with holding company liquidity of just over $2 billion. Operating cash flows were over $450 million for the quarter, despite the high claim payments related to Storm Sandy, as well as a discretionary $150 million contribution that we made to our qualified pension plan to maintain its high funding level even in this extremely low interest rate environment. Note, too, that for the full year, we generated over $3.2 billion of operating cash flows and, as Jay said, we returned over $2.1 billion of excess capital to our shareholders, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy.","Turning to reserve development. We once again experienced net favorable prior year reserve development on a consolidated basis, $222 million pretax for the quarter, up from $126 million in the prior-year quarter. Also, as has been the case throughout the year, each of our business segments experienced favorable development. Business Insurance accounted for a little over half of this quarter's total, driven by better-than-expected loss experience related to last year's catastrophes, lower-than-expected claim department expenses or ULAE, and a modest improvement in Workers' Comp reserves. Most of the rest of this quarter's favorable development came from the Bond & Financial Products businesses within FP&II, and surety and management liability. For the full year, net favorable prior year reserve development, on a consolidated basis, was $940 million pretax, up from $715 million in the prior year.","I'd also like to share with you a preliminary view of what our 2012 Schedule P will look like when it's filed. All accident years, other than 2011, have developed favorably, including accident years 2002 and prior, notwithstanding the A&E charges we recorded earlier in the year. Unfavorable development related to the 2011 accident year was small, only approximately $155 million pretax that was mostly due to higher-than-expected severity in Commercial and Personal Auto.","Similarly, looking at our preliminary Schedule P data on a product line rather than on an accident year basis, shows that all of our product lines, with the exception of Commercial and Personal Auto, experienced net favorable prior year reserve development in 2012. Commercial and Personal Auto developed unfavorably on a pretax basis by only approximately $110 million and $25 million respectively, again, driven by the 2011 accident year.","Finally, I would note that all of our capital ratios remained at or better than our target levels at the end of the year. Net unrealized investment gains, which were up for the full year, decreased slightly during the quarter to almost $4.8 billion pretax or $3.1 billion after-tax, while book value per share was $67.31 or 8% higher than at the beginning of the year.","So with that, let me turn things over to Brian.","Brian W. MacLean","Thanks, Jay. I'm going to give an overview of the segment results, beginning with Business Insurance. Although operating income was down quarter-over-quarter in Business Insurance due to the losses from Storm Sandy, the fundamentals of the business continued to strengthen. As Jay just mentioned, prior year reserve development was favorable and higher than last year, and the underlying combined ratio of 92.8% was a 4-point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2011. On a full year basis, the underlying combined ratio improved more than 3 points year-over-year, with about 2 points of that improvement due to earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trend.","Looking at the production statistics, starting on Page 9, retention continued to be strong at 80%, while new business was up slightly versus both the previous quarter and the fourth quarter of 2011. Net written premiums increased 6% in the quarter, with the largest increase in Workers' Comp, driven by higher pricing on our guarantee cost business and growth in residual market pools.","Drilling into the pricing results, renewal premium change was 10%, up about 1 point from the third quarter, driven by pure rate increases of 8% and exposure of 2%. The 8% rate gains we achieved this quarter were up slightly from the third quarter and up 2 points from the 6% that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2011. The rate increases ranged from 6% to 10% across all lines and were once again led by Workers' Compensation and Commercial Auto. I would note that within the quarter, rate change was highest in the month of December, with total Business Insurance rate change of 8.3% and Commercial Accounts rate change of 9.8%.","Loss trend, excluding catastrophes, has remained at approximately 4% overall. Specifically, the loss trend concerns in Workers' Comp and Commercial Auto that we spoke about several quarters ago, appear to have mitigated and are trending toward long-term historical trends. So overall, excluding weather, a very stable picture.","Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our results in Select, our small commercial business. In this business, we are pleased with the performance of our platform and operational dynamics, and we've seen great success in the marketplace. On the pricing side, as seen on the data on Slide 10, we've also made significant progress. Renewal premium change this quarter was nearly 12%, up consistently over the past 2 years. Along with these pricing gains, retention was up 1 point in each of the last 3 quarters, coming in at 78% this quarter. New business was down somewhat from recent quarters due to an increase in new business pricing. These pricing and underwriting actions have had a meaningful impact on our product, profit margins in this business, and we are very pleased with the results to date.","So summarizing the entire Business Insurance segment, we were able to sustain our level of rate gains this quarter on top of the 6% gains from the prior-year quarter. This compounding of pure price improvement, combined with the 4% underlying loss trend, has had a meaningful impact on returns. However, given the ongoing weather volatility and challenging investment return environment, we will continue to -- we continue to see the need to execute on our targeted pricing strategy.","In the Financial, Professional & International segment, our operating income decreased by 14% due entirely to the impact of Sandy, largely in our Lloyd's business. The underlying combined ratio improved about 3 points, for both the quarter and full year, driven primarily by increased rate in portfolio management in our Management Liability business, as well as risk selection in International.","In Bond & Financial products, net written premiums were flat quarter-over-quarter, with higher production in Management Liability, offset by continued decline in surety volume. In Management Liability, retention remained strong at 85% in the quarter, while pure rate gains increased to 8%, making this the sixth consecutive quarter of sequentially increasing rate. Renewal premium change was 6%, which included negative exposure of 2% in the quarter, driven by a reduction in multiyear policies.","In International, net written premiums were up about 4% or $12 million on a constant currency basis. The increase was driven by results in the U.K. and somewhat lower levels of seeded premium, partially offset by lower volume in the Canadian surety market. The International underlying loss ratio continues to trend favorably on a quarter-over-quarter basis.","I'd also like to note that in December, we exercised our option to increase our ownership interest in the Brazilian joint venture from, round numbers, 43% to 49%. The results in Brazil have been very good, and we are pleased with our progress there.","In Personal Insurance, fourth quarter results were significantly impacted by Sandy with after-tax cat losses of $370 million for the segment. Excluding the impact of cats and favorable prior year development, the underlying combined ratio improved over 9 points for the quarter and nearly 5 points on a full year basis. However, to really understand the dynamics in the segment results, we need to look at Homeowners and Auto separately, because they are somewhat different stories.","In Auto, As Jay mentioned in his opening comments, we are not yet satisfied with our performance but believe we're on the path to improving our results. We continue to be very pleased with pricing gains, with renewal premium change of 9%, up about 1 point from the third quarter and up 5 points from the fourth quarter of 2011. Retention remained solid at 81% but as anticipated, our new business volumes have been impacted by our pricing actions. These pricing actions are in response to the severity challenges across all coverages that we began speaking to you about in the fourth quarter of 2011.","The physical damage severity pressures we saw in 2011 persisted through the first half of 2012 but have since returned to near-normal levels. The bodily injury severity trends, however, have continued at elevated levels throughout the year. In addition to expected general inflation, we believe this increase in bodily injury trend is a result of more severe accidents. There are a number of environmental factors that can contribute to this trend, for example, data recently released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows road deaths for the first 9 months of 2012 increased 7% year-over-year, the largest such increase since 1975.","So over the last 2 quarters, severity for all coverages is running just over 5%. With mix adjusted frequency about flat, overall loss trend is in the 5% range. Given the renewal premium change we've been able to achieve over the last 4 quarters, earned rate is now more than offsetting the aggregate loss trend.","This margin expansion is somewhat difficult to see in our reported results due to prior period adjustments. On the Agency Auto combined ratio exhibit on Page 16, you can see these adjustments and the resulting adjusted underlying combined -- GAAP combined ratio, which improved about 1 point for both the quarter and full year. So on a go-forward basis, as you heard Jay say, at our current level of rate gains, and assuming loss trend does not increase materially from current levels, this will result in improved underwriting profitability in the line.","Turning to Home, pricing was also very strong. Renewal premium change coming in at 13% was up 1 point from the third quarter and up 5 points from the fourth quarter of last year. Retention continued to be strong at 84%, while new business volume was lower than recent quarters due to the execution of our pricing strategy, higher deductibles and other profitability initiatives. Given these initiatives, our core underwriting margins are seeing significant improvement. However, it is difficult to evaluate this line's performance, excluding catastrophes, especially given the last 2 years experience. Accordingly, with the ongoing volatility of weather patterns, we will continue to seek improved underwriting and policy pricing terms and conditions.","We feel good about the progress we've made in the Personal Insurance segment, but challenges remain. We will continue to locally execute rate increases, underwriting changes and modifications to terms and conditions to further improve the risk profile and profitability of this business.","So in summary, looking across all the business segments, let me reiterate what you've heard from us for the last several quarters. We are encouraged that we've been able to successfully execute a strategy that has resulted in tangible improvements in our underlying underwriting margins. We believe that these pricing and underwriting actions are appropriate, given the current level of investment returns, weather volatility and general loss trend, and we are well positioned to continue to thoughtfully execute on our strategy in 2013.","With that, let me turn it over to Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi","Great. We will now begin the question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Andre, we're ready to begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I have a question on the Sandy loss. I'm just trying to get a sense of where you might be in the kind of the finality of your loss estimates. I'm particularly interested in kind of cost inflation on reconstruction, if there's a tail from business interruption? And if you can quantify closed versus open claims at this point.","Brian W. MacLean","So one is -- this is Brian. Obviously, with this magnitude of event, there are always claims and issues that are still outstanding, but broadly speaking, there's no significant issue that we're looking at from the business interruption or liability or whatever side that leaves us feeling that there's a big tail. I'd turn to Doreen on the specifics with the closed claims. If you've got some of that data, Doreen, and want to share it.","Doreen Spadorcia","I do, Brian. This is Doreen Spadorcia. Jay quoted you some statistics as to where we were 30 days from thinking -- reported from first notice of loss. At this point, since we're further on than 30 days, probably on the property side, we're at about 95% of our losses in that position. In terms of tail issues, on Auto, we still have salvage losses to collect and we're in the middle of doing that, but those we've factored in. And on Boat & Yacht that those losses tend to take a little bit longer as well, but again, all of them have been factored into our analysis. So we're pretty well through most of those claims that were reported.","Jay S. Fishman","And Doreen, my comments were to Personal Insurance; your comments were to all lines.","Doreen Spadorcia","Yes. Absolutely. Thank you, Jay.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So just to clarify, you're saying you're 95% closed on those property claims?","Doreen Spadorcia","Yes.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Wow. And then just on, would -- just one on demand surge, a lot of reconstruction going on in New Jersey. Is that becoming an issue, like it has with past events, or is that under control?","Doreen Spadorcia","I would say, at this point, our estimates of what we saw when we initially evaluated the property, our holdings, we always have situations, Randy, when someone has additional damage and we look at those. And that's kind of a normal course. But at this point, nothing out of the ordinary.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, just 2 questions. The first is in the Personal Auto side, the PIF count shrank, a bit more than it had been. It looks like renewal is relatively stable, new business is down. I'm wondering if you could just give us some color around that PIF growth because that was down a bit more than it had been, and more than we had expected.","Jay S. Fishman","Jay, this is Jay Fishman. I think you're analyzing it correctly. The PIF is being impacted by our pricing increases. We recognize that we're -- in some areas that there are less expensive alternatives that are available to agents and in some cases, they're embracing it. Our pricing strategy is based on what our loss trends look like and the severity dynamic is real, and it is substantive and doesn't appear -- we may be wrong about this, but it doesn't appear to be a Travelers-only phenomena. This seems to be broad-based. So we're taking the actions that we know we have to, to produce appropriate returns over time. And if the policies in force shrink somewhat, that's fine, and we will just continue to price it as we know have to, to achieve the returns that we speak about.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Makes sense. Second question, in the past, you have given some discussion or guidance around capital management kind of forward-looking. As you look at 2013, can you talk about your buyback expectations relative to your earnings?","Jay S. Benet","Jay, this is Jay Benet. I'd go back to the wording that we had in the Ks and the Qs. Nothing's really changed. We have earnings that we're going to generating. From those earnings, we need to have capital to support whatever business growth we have. There may be some needs like pension contributions into our qualified plan, whatever. We lay those out. But ultimately, the idea behind our capital management strategy is to return all the excess capital that we have to the shareholders, and that'll go back to shareholders in the form of dividends, as well as common stock repurchases. And it's really going to be driven by the level of earnings, ultimately.","Jay S. Fishman","Let me -- it's Jay Fishman. Let me just come back with one sentence on the PIF count. You did see it, but I just want to make sure it's clear. Retention remains stable in Auto. We are not losing existing accounts. What we have done is experience a lower level of new business than historical trends, but retention importantly, is remaining stable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have 2 questions here for you. The first one, I was hoping, Jay and Brian, maybe you could comment about where we are with respect to rate adequacy in the Business Insurance area. If I look at it on an at or near basis, it looks like you're probably kind of low to mid-teens ROEs on that business right now, is that correct?","Jay S. Fishman","Well, we -- Brian, it's Jay Fishman. We haven't disclosed what our product line returns are. I think you can look at the overall business and really make 2 adjustments that are available to you, and you'll come up with what, I think, a reasonable way to think about return on equity is. One is, you can easily eliminate the favorable development. And two, I think you can adjust the catastrophe costs back to what a more normal run rate would look like. Those 2 are not identical in the absolute level, but they're actually pretty close. They just about cancel each other out. And if you do that, you'll get to a business ROE overall that's round numbers. And I'm not being precise here because I don't have it in my hand, but round numbers, it's about 10%. Now in terms of -- 10%, to 11%, let's say, and people are looking at me. And the real question that you're posing that's so difficult to answer is rate adequacy in the environment where the risk-free rate is 1.5%. We've talked about -- in previous quarters, we've talked about maintaining our aspirational goal of mid-teens return on equity over time. But we've said that under the current environment, it's simply not achievable, and it remains not achievable. And I think most of us who are responsible for managing complex financial businesses are wrestling with if your cost of equity at the moment is sitting in the 7% to 8% range, what is rate adequacy, what is return adequacy in this environment? This is unprecedented, and I spend -- we spend a fair amount of our time thinking about what level of returns is really appropriate. Because I think one of the risks in managing any business, and I think we saw it in 2008, is when management decides that it's going to try and get blood from a stone, it just doesn't happen. But if you look at it overall, we're sort of in that 10% to 11% range at the moment, and a bunch of factors coming at us. But I know you have a longer question, but that's sort of where we sit at the moment.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, the second one is a little more detail on the Commercial Auto loss trend situation there. Is it physical damage, is it liability, what's going on with that line?","Brian W. MacLean","Within Commercial Auto, it's not dissimilar to the conversation we just had on Personal Auto. So it's fundamentally severity-driven. And at this point, the bigger severity issue is on the bodily injury side.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","The accident year combined in Business Insurance improved by -- improved materially 400 basis points. Was that all quarter-to-quarter, or was there some catch-up from other quarters this year?","Jay S. Benet","Yes, this is Jay Benet. There really aren't any catch-up adjustments relating to earlier quarters in the year. So that's -- with minor variation on that, that's a pure number.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. That's -- it was a very good number. Could you ballpark that -- and not looking for an exact number, but I mean how much of that 400 basis point improvement is from nonrenewing poor business versus getting rate versus loss trend and existing business?","Brian W. MacLean","So this is Brian. Hard to precisely segment that, but I did say in my comments, we're getting about 2 points from pure rate over the loss trend now. And then, there's always other stuff within a quarter that's moving within the loss ratio, so the non-cat weather, other large losses, fire losses, et cetera will be volatile. And some of that was moving to the good. So the biggest driver is the rate in excess of loss trend, which is 3 points? Okay, 3 points in the quarter -- in the quarter, yes, right. So that's the biggest piece of it. Obviously, there's something with the re-underwriting issues in a lasered way that you're talking about, but that is not the broad-based issue moving through the results.","Jay S. Benet","And we don't track, because I wouldn't know how, candidly, to track the improvement in profitability that resulted from nonrenewing accounts. That's -- specifically to your question, that's just not something that I -- that we measure or keep track of.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","If I can go back to Agency Auto really quickly, I think, when we saw the decelerating new business despite, maybe, incremental improvements in pricing, does not mean that the environment is becoming more competitive?","Jay S. Fishman","Well, I don't think it's an incremental improvement in pricing. I'd use a different word, and the kind of pricing change that's occurred here is substantial. And at the Agency Auto level, with increasing use of comparative raters at the agency level, pricing is certainly more important, we suspect, than it was, let's say, 5 or 6 years ago. A greater ability, technological change at the agency level for agents to generate multiple quotes relatively quickly and efficiently so that it's -- the comparison process is just easier. So I think that, that's really what's driving it. This is a meaningful change in pricing, driven by a meaningful change in loss trend and weather and interest rates and all that goes with it, and the price is the price, and it'll show up on comparative raters. I don't believe, I may be wrong about this, but I don't believe that the Agency Auto business has become a business where the only thing that matters is price. We do believe that agents have views about companies and their ability to serve individual customers in certain ways, and that's what we've traded on all these years and continue to now. So whatever the new business dynamics are, they are. We have a really strong philosophy here, which is that volume is not a goal, it's a result. If we do all the things that are right, and we're moving in the right direction, the revenues, the premiums will be what they'll be, and then we manage the business accordingly. And that's really what you're seeing in Personal Auto.","Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very thorough. The tax rate on the non-net investment income component was a lot lower than, I think, it's been in prior quarters. I was hoping someone can explain that.","Jay S. Benet","I'm not sure that's the case. So if you take a look at the tax accruals, if you were to just separate investment income from the rest of earnings, effectively, what you do is, you take round numbers, 35% of the non-investment income, that's the tax provision or tax benefit, if there's an underwriting loss. And then, as it relates to the investment income, we give you the effective tax rates. So I think if you do the arithmetic, you really come very close to what the tax provisions are.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I had one question, just kind of looking over the last couple years, looks like you've got 8 points of rate in Business Insurance over the last 12 months or so and then, another almost 7 points the year before that. So 15 points in the aggregate of a couple years, looks like combined ratio is a bit better. Just trying to understand, does that mean that more rate -- we should expect more rate to earn through over the next 12 months? How much of that dynamic is due to mix changes, the Commercial Auto stuff that Jay mentioned upfront, or is there something else? And I just have one follow-up.","Jay S. Fishman","I think we'll answer this in a couple of pieces. First, obviously, written rate becomes earned rate, so yes, what we've written in these last several quarters will convert to earned over the next several quarters, and that's just arithmetic. The -- our intent here is to continue. This was always a granular, active pricing strategy. We've commented before we're not big believers here in sort of mythical cycles that carry the industry up and then carry it down. We think that it is one agent, one underwriter and one account at a time. So this strategy here has been extremely active and very granular and applied to individual accounts, putting rate at accounts that need it, taking all of the factors into account: taking interest rates, taking the perspective of changing weather and taking some of the loss trend that affect some of the lines into account. So that's going to be the -- that's going to be our prospective policy, and we're going to continue to do that. I don't know if you have any...","Brian W. MacLean","Well, specifically on the mix issue, it's not fundamentally a mix issue. We've talked for a number of quarters now that, although Commercial Auto and comp are at the higher end of the rate change grid for us, it's really pretty broad based, and we're getting between 6 and 10 points in all lines. And we haven't really shifted our line mix significantly at all. So that's not driving it.","Jay S. Fishman","We shared with you in the last quarter, in the previous quarters, the breakdown of the accounts, the segments. The one we show you are the ones that track profitability, a long-term profitability, combined ratio by account -- loss ratio by account, actually. And we said in the last quarter and before that, that our greatest opportunity was in those segments of the accounts that were at the low end of the profitability spectrum. We still believe that to be true, that the greatest opportunity for us in terms of improving profitability is at that less-profitable end of the segment, which again speaks to the granular nature of the strategy that we're applying.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And I just wanted to revisit maybe direct. I mean, we've talked about it maybe a little while back. How are you thinking about that? It looks like the first time that PIF started to fall a bit, maybe ratio. I don't know if that's advertising came down a bit in the quarter on a sequential basis. How are you thinking about that? And what is your outlook for when that business needs to rightsize in order for that to be an area of continued investment?","Jay S. Fishman","No, it's a pleasure. In the direct business, we've been involved for the last, I don't know, several quarters, 2, maybe 3, something like that, in a very granular test of elasticity pricing strategy applied in, I -- 2 or 3 states, I -- where we really didn't have a robust agency business. And we were able to change the pricing in those states, both agency and direct, to begin to test the elasticity of demand in the direct arena. That's one of the reasons why the advertising spend is down, because it's being applied in a very narrow way in these last several months, just trying to drive activity in these 2 states, I'm told. And the results have been extremely informative and encouraging in that we're getting increasingly close or closer to having a pricing schedule, a pricing strategy, that we think can work in the direct arena and can be applied both at reasonable marketing success, we believe, as well as an underwriting success. But we remain some distance away yet from what I would call launching in a broad way, but we continue to make real progress and are encouraged by the results. There's nothing that causes us to think that we should discontinue the spend on it. Quite the contrary, we feel really encouraged about what we're learning and discovering. And as I've always said, the thing that we could do wrong here is have a marketing success and a financial failure. And that would not be acceptable here, so we're going to continue to take our time and make sure that when we aggressively approach the business, that we do so with all the requisite knowledge and learning and skills and with a high degree of confidence in the success of the program.","Operator","And this line is -- Mr. Zaremski, your line is open.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. I was hoping to better understand the underlying margin improvement drivers within Home. So other than pricing, is there quantifiable elements coming from geographic culling and\/or terms of condition changes that you guys have been talking about for a while?","Brian W. MacLean","Well, first of all, the biggest driver is pricing. There's no question about that. And...","Jay S. Benet","Well, and weather. Yes, and there's been a number of things. In the fourth quarter of last year, we had an unusually high concentration of fire-related losses. This year, we had a low level of fire-related losses, relative to some norms. In addition to that, there was a little more weather in the fourth quarter of last year than this year. So Brian spoke before about just things that happened on a quarter-to-quarter basis that caused some variations but those along with, the major item being loss cost trend x weather, which is a hard thing to really talk about as it relates to Homeowners being lower than earned rate. And if you look at those 3 components, the lower fire losses, the lower weather-related losses, as well as earned rate over loss trend, then that's really what's making up the difference.","Jay S. Fishman","And to answer your question directly: We really don't have a metric to convey to you the impact of, let's say, increasing deductibles on the profitability of the business. We would have to go back and rerun the losses using the deductibles that existed previously, and that's just not possible for us to do.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, as a follow-up to the questions about the capital management for 2013. So I see you've contributed, I think, over a couple hundred million dollars to the pension this year and you have $500 million of debt coming due in a couple months. In regards to the pension, if interest rates stay low, should we expect a similar contribution? And are you guys considering refi-ing with that?","Jay S. Benet","Let's talk about the pension first. If you strip away all that takes place in valuing the -- a PBO versus the assets, there's a normal level of earned credit, if you will, that runs through the numbers. And it's about $100 million, round numbers, a year. So if everything worked in accordance with the assumptions, in a steady state, the pension contribution would be about that. The reason the pension contribution is higher this year is things don't work as a steady state. We had a good return on the assets. On the other hand, when you look at the valuation of the pension benefit obligation as of 12\/31, which is a spot rate interest concept that you use, you had very, very low interest rates at that point in time. So we looked at that and said, \"Gee, on balance, it feels like $200 million is the right number to put in this year.\" It got us to a funding level that was high, approximately 90%, which is where we started the year. If rates spike up, we're not going to be terribly overfunded. We'll just adjust future funding accordingly. And that would be a nice position to be in, frankly, if rates went up a bit. But $100 million is what we think about as more of a normal level on a year-by-year basis. As it relates to the debt, as we generally do, we try to maintain full flexibility in dealing with our capital position. So we ended the year, as I said earlier, with over $2 billion of holding company liquidity, which allows us to be in a position of paying the debt when the debt's due to avoid any kind of liquidity concerns. And then we'll just continue to evaluate what the proper structure of our balance sheet is going forward based on interest rates and based on how we feel. But certainly, in terms of capacity, we have the capacity to keep the debt ratio just where it is today if we so choose.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","My first question is on your catastrophe reinsurance coverage, which I know expires on June 30. And maybe this is a bit too early: The -- when you new look towards 2013, 2014, do you think your cat cover will look similar? Or has the thinking changed post Sandy?","Jay S. Fishman","The thinking actually changed a little bit a couple of years ago when we reintroduced -- I'm sorry, when we introduced an aggregate -- cumulative aggregate element to our reinsurance program. And we started that, I think, last year at the July coverage and actually expanded it some effective January 1. We actually increased this cumulative aggregate program, which has the effect of giving us a benefit against the retention in the cat program should the individual events exceed retentions and then cumulatively apply against the overall cat program. With respect to the cat program itself, I wouldn't anticipate any significant changes to that. Our property coverage exposure really has not changed. We were comfortable with where we were last year. It may depend upon pricing move a little bit up or a little down, but the important change, the more important change, is the introduction of this aggregate program to our overall cat merits.","Jay S. Benet","Yes, the one thing I would add is, when we did Long Point Re II, we had pegged it to RMS. And when RMS 11 came out, it raised the trigger points associated with that. And in this [ph] past year, we issued a $250 million cat bond with Long Point Re III. And as Long Point Re II turns itself over, we will probably bring those limits -- bring those trigger points down into something that looks more like Long Point Re III.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Got it. That's very helpful. The only other question I have is on Business Insurance pricing and maybe using Slide 9 as a backdrop, and perhaps this question is for Jay. The -- when you talk to your largest agent or business, post Sandy, is there a greater acceptance on pricing? Or do you think there was an uptick in December, and just based on the economic conditions, it's already beginning to sort of normalize as you look towards Q1?","Jay S. Fishman","I think it's -- well, I think the environment, particularly for the January 1 renewals -- and this is anecdotal, what I'm giving you, because I don't -- we don't have the data yet, but the anecdotal observations for January in renewals and the related rate was very similar in the aggregate to what December looked and felt like. So I don't -- I wouldn't anticipate any immediate change of consequence in January. I -- Sandy is a tough one to really talk about pricing. I think that it continues to reinforce the notion that weather patterns may be changing, and we've been saying that now for a couple of years and embracing that in our pricing strategy. And I suspect -- again, no evidence on this, but I suspect that the storm will simply make that argument easier to make, both at the agent level as well as the insured level. I would tell you this, notwithstanding how -- sort of the perceptions of Sandy, it was in the playbook. The storm itself, the track, the path, it wasn't something that -- as we do our analysis and modeling, that we didn't contemplate. It was certainly there. I think the surprise, to the extent there was one, in Sandy was, to some extent, the timing of it. Meaning, it was full moon, it was 2 tides. There were a lot of ancillary factors that made it more significant than it might otherwise have been. But importantly, the flooding was more severe. And this is really -- it's predominantly a -- I'd say it's largely a Homeowners kind of question with respect to the NFIP program, but it does have its impact on commercial insurance as well. There were buildings that we insured in Lower Manhattan that we would not had contemplated would have been part of a flooding event. The flood coverage that we extended was really episodic for them, meaning we contemplated broken pipes or backup or things of that nature, not a flood coming out of the East River or the Hudson River. And importantly, the dynamic there is the sea level. And this is just from things I read, but sea level is, depending upon who you ask, anywhere from 6 to 12 inches higher in Manhattan than it was about a century ago, driven largely by the melting of the polar ice caps and what that's doing to the water level. So I think what Sandy will do is cause people to think somewhat differently about concentrated flood risk than they had before. It'll take some time, it's a complicated issue. But all of us, I suspect, we certainly are, looking at flood concentrations in the commercial segment and analyzing it with a little different perspective than we did before. Those were -- that was, I think, the big takeaway from Sandy that was different from what we might otherwise have contemplated.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","This is a follow-up to Brian Meredith's question before on sort of rate increases in Business Insurance and the ROE, because the ROE right now seems to certainly be pretty healthy [ph], in fact close to about 11% x the OCI. So just first, curious on the Business Insurance front, how do you see rate increases this year versus last year? Do you see them tapering off a little bit? Or are you pushing for the same magnitude of rate increases?","Jay S. Fishman","Well, it's -- as I've said before, it's a very granular approach. We have accounts that are at pricing levels that we're satisfied with, that we feel good about, and we have accounts where that's not the case. And that may be driven by the loss experience. It may be driven by the mix and long tail versus short tail, and the impact of interest rates. And it may be impacted also by geographic concentrations relative to catastrophe management. We look at this very granularly. In some businesses, as we've told you before, we break accounts down into quintiles. In some business, we actually break them so far as deciles. And our pricing strategy is driven by the account and its sports class and its performance and where it fits. So we'll let the -- we will continue to do what we do by looking at individual accounts. We have no artificial limits. We look at an account and we try and understand its profitability and how it contributes. And if it's not contributing in what we think is a substantive way, we have a discussion with the agent. So that strategy is no different than it was a year ago. And we'll continue to do it, and the number will be what the number is. And I do -- I would acknowledge to you that a very important question in all this, and I don't have an answer for you but it's one that I think about a great deal is, again using a 1.5% risk-free rate, what level of overall returns are achievable and sustainable without jeopardizing the risk profile of the organization. That is the question. And we're not there yet, but we're -- so we're going to continue to push.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So fair enough. And you mentioned that the rate increase is, I think, 8.3% in December, so tipped towards the higher end. Could you give us some color on what the rate increases were in January of this year?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. So when the -- so this is Brian. In the middle-market businesses where we have a little bit better transparency into that, the January ones, the early January that we've seen the middle market look a lot like December, so that's encouraging. Small commercial, it's harder to state, and so we'll get a better look at that at the end of the quarter. But the little peek that we've got is encouraging, but that's -- it's a little window.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that helpful. And just one follow-up. From the Commercial Auto, there were some adverse physical [ph] development. If you could please provide some color on sort of the subcomponents of that -- those small fleet versus big fleet, along with trucking, and whether that was more of a severity issue or a frequency issue.","Brian W. MacLean","So it's a -- just like we said in personal auto, it's a bodily injury severity issue. And it's really across the book of business. So it -- we don't think -- the Commercial Auto book of business, right. We don't think of it as a really lasered underwriting as in a problem in one business, but we're seeing it kind of systemically in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to -- in your prepared remarks, you mentioned Schedule P and sort of gave us a sneak peek. I just wanted to confirm the -- so the Workers' Comp line has inflected. So I seem to recall that the 2010 policy year developed adversely when we look at the '11 data. And it sounds like, from your remarks, that '11 policy year is going to have developed favorably when we look at the '12 Schedule P. Is that true for -- and this is for Workers' Comp, specifically?","Jay S. Benet","Yes, well, for Workers' Comp overall last year, we did see, as you talked about for the last -- yes, I should get into the years because we're in 2013. Well, if you look -- if you go back a year and you're in the end of -- the beginning of 2012 looking backwards, the 2010 accident year did develop unfavorably at that time for Workers' Comp. If we now roll the clock forward, there hasn't been any further developments associated with the 2010 accident year in 2012. And then if we look at the 2011 accident year for Workers' Comp, a year later in 2012, we've seen some slightly favorable development for that. And overall, in 2012, as I said, our Workers' Comp has developed favorably. So that's the Workers' Comp story. And I think it speaks to what we were communicating a year ago. Given the nature of our processes, the granularity of the data that we have and the quarterly diligence we have, we like to believe that when we -- we see trends early, we react to those trends and we book them and move on.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, good. And I mean, that's a great inflection. Do you -- this may not be fair, but do you think the industry is going to see the same or, as, I guess, your remarks just suggested, are you way ahead of it?","Jay S. Benet","I hope that -- well, we certainly can't speak for the industry. I mean, everybody has got their data, their views, their reserving practices. And I think you just have to look at what companies will be doing. But in terms of our data and our analysis and being able to stay on top of things, we think the numbers speak for themselves.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And last on Comp is just I haven't heard a good explanation: Why did frequency spike up? I think it was a frequency issue, at least at the industry level. With the benefit, in some ways, of hindsight, what is the reasoning behind this, the higher loss trend that came through that was somewhat unexpected that, obviously, now you guys have gotten in front of?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, so we've talked about it a good bit, I don't know, a year-plus ago. But as you hit the economic downturn, clearly, losses mitigated -- frequency mitigated as it usually does. People are concerned with maybe losing their jobs so they don't go out on a Comp claim. As employers lay off workers, they lay off the least experienced first, et cetera, et cetera. And then you would typically see a rebound from that as there's a -- there's kind of a pent-up delay in loss reporting. And so what we saw clearly in our results, we can't speak to the rest of the industry, was that, that spiked up a little harder than we thought it was going to. And so we had a backlog, and so delayed reporting, from the previous years, and that kind of came through. So our frequency picked up. Again...","Jay S. Fishman","It was 2010. It was in 2010 that we saw a spike in what we have come to call late-reported claims, accidents occurring prior but reported in 2010.","Brian W. MacLean","Right, right. So these are people who maybe an incident in '09 and tried to work through it and by the time 2010 comes along -- and again, we expected some of that. It was just greater magnitude than what we had originally expected. And we've seen it mitigate.","Jay S. Benet","And this is Jay Benet again. I just want to -- I'm being reminded by one of my colleagues, the word \"preliminary\" is a very critical element of my discussion of schedule fee. It is early. We still are putting it together, but directionally, we feel that this is -- what I said before, is where we're going to end up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I had just a couple of follow-ups. The first is on investment income. Can you talk about the seasonality of that? It seems to be stronger in 4Q than in 1Q, and I'm just thinking if that trend will repeat in 2013, 4Q '12 versus 1Q '13.","Brian W. MacLean","Well, in the fourth quarter of '12, a lot of private equity funds were trying to sell companies because of an uncertain tax filing in 2013. That may be a one-year occurrence...","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was referring just to the fixed income aspect.","Brian W. MacLean","I'm not sure there really is seasonality there. I mean, the -- there's $1 million difference where someone seized on. There are 3 elements to that. There's volume of the portfolio, there's rate and then there's calendar days in the quarter. And the net of those accounts for -- generally accounts for any small difference quarter-to-quarter. But net investment income from fixed income comes in pretty much like the tide.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, I was looking at fourth quarter '11 stronger than first quarter of '12. And I'm just thinking, well, should we not use that $500 million of after-tax fixed income from 4Q '12 as the run rate for the beginning of '13?","Jay S. Benet","Well, what's taking place in fixed income is there's a constant maturity of certain securities in the portfolio, and they're being reinvested at today's rates. And there's been several analyses we've put out into the marketplace, which I'd refer you to, that talk about some estimates of the maturities in the portfolio, how much the yield is on that block that's maturing. And then you can pick your number whether they're going to be reinvested at 200 basis points; 225; 175, less. What you're generally seeing is a deterioration in the overall yield in the portfolio. It's not dramatic, but it's real. And the numbers that you see in the webcast, in the fixed income slide, are reflective of that in terms of, as you know, quarter-to-quarter comparisons.","Jay S. Fishman","But there's no seasonality in the fixed income result at all.","Brian W. MacLean","We track book yields quarter to quarter and year to year. And over the 12 months of 2012, book yield of the portfolio declined by 33 basis points. And that's not unusual. But the decline is inexorable until we reach the point at which reinvestment rates -- in which all the securities with high book yields have run off and they're replaced, and that's 2 or 3 years off.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then my separate question is on Personal Auto. To get you to your targeted returns, what type of combined ratio do you feel you need to be able to generate?","Brian W. MacLean","I would say, about a 97, between 96, 97 combined.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two questions. First was just -- is -- you've noted non-cat weather this quarter, and that's been a theme all year. I guess I was just trying to get a handle, is there a number you could give us to kind of quantify how much of a tailwind that was this year? And I recognize that we're comparing 2012 to what was a slightly worse-than-normal year in 2011.","Jay S. Benet","I don't know that we can give you a number. I think we try to do it the other way around. Brian's talked about what the impact of earned rate versus loss trend is. And these other things, whether it's non-cat weather or, as I said earlier, we had fire losses in one quarter higher than another quarter, or there's large loss activity. But we try to do it the other way and talk about what's underlying it in terms of rate versus \"loss trend.\"","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is there a way to give us a sense of whether or not it's -- I would assume -- tell me if this is right, I would assume it's just more a personal lines benefit that it is a commercial lines benefit. Is that perception correct?","Jay S. Benet","No, it's meaningful in both, depending upon the quarter.","Jay S. Fishman","It's not unusual. And I -- we're not, not answering because we don't answer. We're not answering because you're asking a question that's exceptionally difficult for us to actually quantify. It's how much of a -- you're sort of asking, within our normal loss estimates, how much are we relying on of weather, and that's a tough question for us to answer. I -- we do note, though, that it is not unusual in a high-cat year to have lower, what we call, non-cat weather. And I -- and we suspect, can't prove, but we suspect what happens is that some of the claims that would ordinarily show up as non-cat weather get included into the catastrophe estimates, and those customers who had some loss previously now get rolled into here. I -- and it's an anecdotal observation, but it does appear to have some actual fact in the numbers.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, that's fair. I guess the fact that you know it's happening, though, makes it a little surprising to me that we can't get a ballpark number but -- because -- you know what I mean, because that implies there's some recognition of the trend somewhere but...","Brian W. MacLean","But for example, in BI, as I said before, about a 4-point improvement in the combined, roughly 3 points of that is the core price in loss trend. So it's about 1 point of other stuff, a decent chunk of which would be what we're talking about, so -- but it's not...","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. I was -- yes, can you give -- but do you have that handy for the full year? I mean...","Gabriella Nawi","It's not out. We'll try and take some of this off-line because I know we've talked about particularly what affected 2011 for the full year, and you can see some of that in the run rate. So I'll get you off-line.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, no, that's fair. I just don't want to over- or underestimate the core. I guess the other thing was, should we think about the normalizing loss trend we're seeing in -- or what you characterize, I think, as a normalization of the trends in Work Comp as knocking on the -- to kind of the implied rate need in 2012? I know that's been an area where you've been getting some of the bigger headline gains, so I just wonder -- as we're all really focused on what the headline rate number is, but I'm just wondering if that's kind of a very -- a transparent example of where a headline rate might come in, but when you think about what you're getting relative to loss trend, might not affect that spread whatsoever.","Jay S. Fishman","Well, when -- we're looking at each other. First, I'd make -- we -- in Workers' Comp, most certainly, the rate gains are exceeding loss trend in Workers' Comp, resulting in improved profitability and improved returns. So while the loss -- or the projected losses in Comp are substantive because we -- it's long tail and we're dealing with medical and wage inflation, so there's a real number that we use. We -- it's not a number that we disclose. I think it is proprietary and a pricing strategy element. But we do assume a real loss level in Workers' Comp that contemplates changes in those -- in both wage and medical. But at this point, the rate gains are exceeding it. Now I would remind you that Workers' Comp as a return -- thinking about Workers' Comp in a return manner, that it's real long tail, and interest rates really matter there. So it's one of those lines where the interest rate, long-term interest rate, impact is substantive relative to the returns. So that may be as much of the driver as the loss trend dynamic in that line.","Gabriella Nawi","Yes. And Matt, just to be precise, the only thing we talked about moderating was the frequency dynamic that we've seen in 2011. We didn't comment on the other.","Jay S. Fishman","We continue to assume a real number, both in severity, both related to wage and indemnity. It is just a frequency, to Gabby's point, that is -- that we've seen return back to the normal trend line.","Operator","This does conclude the Q&A session for the call. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Nawi.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you very much. Thank you for joining us today. And as always, if you have any follow-up questions, you can call myself or Andrew Hersom in the investor relations department. Thank you very much, and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference for today.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Unfortunately, I need to start on a sad note this morning. This is my fourth earnings call as CEO but the first since we\u2019ve lost our friend, Jay Fishman. I know I am not alone in feeling his loss. Many of you have sent thoughts and prayers. Thank you, we appreciate it.","All of us at Travelers take a great deal of comfort in knowing that we\u2019re carrying on in a culture of excellence, performance and innovation that Jay left behind. It outlives him. It\u2019s an enormous part of his legacy and we\u2019re grateful for it. To sum it up in Jay\u2019s words, we all feel remarkably fortunate to have known him and worked with him. At this point, Jay would have of course demand that we get back to work, so let\u2019s get to the results.","This morning, we reported third quarter operating income of $701 million or $2.40 per share and operating return on equity of 12.5%. Our underwriting results remain strong as reflected in a 92.9% combined ratio and our net investment income is down only slightly from the prior year quarter.","Across all our businesses, the third quarter was another example of the successful execution of our marketplace strategies, and generally speaking underlying trends have not changed. Pricing and retention remain stable and consistent with recent trends. In our commercial businesses, retention continues to be at historic highs with positive renewal premium change.","In domestic business insurance, renewal rate change has improved a little bit for two sequential quarters led by our middle market business where rate has also increased sequentially month-to-month in the quarter. Underneath that middle market, we again achieved rate gains in excess of loss trend on our poorer-performing segments.","We also benefited from a mix shift in our better performing segments as the loss ratio on the retained business in those segments was better than the loss ratio on non-renewed business, the results of managing the business on a very granular level.","In personal insurance, we continue to achieve strong top line growth in the quarter with continued growth in policies in force in both our agency auto and homeowners businesses. We believe that being able to deliver an account solution to our customers and agents is an important and meaningful competitive advantage.","More than half of our personalized premium come from accounts for which we write both auto and home policies. When we write both the auto and the home, we can be more competitive in the pricing for our customers since it creates higher customer lifetime value for us through higher retentions and a more complete view of the risk.","While we manage the profitability of the auto and home lines independently, we also manage to a portfolio return. We\u2019ll be focusing more than usual on the performance of the auto business this morning but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that the all-in combined ratio for a personalized business was 94.1% for the nine months, a very good result.","Turning back to consolidated results for all three segments, underwriting results for the quarter were impacted by lower levels of net favorable prior year reserve development, higher non-cat weather-related losses and in personal lines higher-than-expected losses associated with auto bodily injury. Jay Benet will have more to say about the prior year development.","The higher bodily injury severity in personal auto had a $29 million after-tax impact on the current accident year, $20 million of which related to the first and second quarters, a modest impact. Brian will discuss it in more detail.","I'd like to highlight that we believe that the increase in auto bodily severity is environmental and not specific to the Quantum Auto 2.0 product, as we see it across all our personal insurance auto program and in our commercial auto and trucking books. In anticipation of this trend continuing, we are addressing it through pricing and we believe that the product remains positioned to deliver target returns over time.","I\u2019d also add that it\u2019s important to understand that when trends change in any part of our business and they will, what\u2019s important is having the ability to recognize it and react quickly. We believe our leading analytics give us an important advantage in this regard.","In terms of net investment income, fixed income returns declined in line with our expectations and we were pleased to see an improvement in our return from the non-fixed income portfolio. All of this resulted in a very strong operating return on equity in the quarter and year-to-date. Given the continued historically low interest rate environment and the other items impacting our results this quarter, we\u2019re particularly pleased with that result.","In terms of the strategy going forward, you can expect more of the same. In this low interest rate environment, we\u2019re underwriting matters more than ever. We have significant competitive advantages in our data and analytics expertise, claim and risk control capabilities and talent. Combining that with our active capital management strategy, we remain well positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading returns over time.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jay Benet.","Jay Benet","Thanks, Alan. Consistent with what we had said about the first two quarters of the year, we are once again pleased with our results this quarter; operating income of $701 million and operating return on equity of 12.5% notwithstanding their being lower than the prior year quarter.","As in the first half of the year, these reductions did not result from fundamental changes in business trends, rather as Alan said, they were primarily driven by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and higher non-cat weather-related losses.","Net investment income, which totaled $472 million after-tax, was down only 12 million from the prior year quarter entirely due to the continuing impact of the low interest rate environment on fixed income returns. Non-fixed income returns improved from recent quarters to a level that was slightly higher than the prior year quarter.","We continue to experience net favorable prior year reserve development on a consolidated basis, which totaled $39 million pre-tax, down from 199 million pre-tax in the prior year quarter.","The business in international insurance, net favorable development of $19 million pre-tax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experienced in GL ex-A&E for accident years 2006 and prior and for 2014 and 2015, in workers\u2019 comp for accident years 2006 and prior and for 2015 and in commercial auto for accident years 2011 and prior, partially offset by a $225 million increase to our asbestos reserves.","The asbestos reserve increase related to a broad number of policyholders and was driven by higher estimates for projected settlement and defense costs for mesothelioma claims than we had previously assumed. Notwithstanding these higher cost estimates, our overall view of the underlying asbestos environment remained essentially unchanged from recent periods.","In bond and specialty insurance, net favorable development of $41 million pre-tax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in fidelity and surety for accident years 2009 through 2015, while reserve development in personal insurance which remained favorable to-date.","Homeowners and other had a modest amount of unfavorable development this quarter, $21 million pre-tax primarily resulting from higher than expected loss experience for a small number of liability claims related to the 2013 and 2014 accident years. Notwithstanding this current quarter activity, the homeowners and other 2013 and 2014 accident years have developed net favorably since their inception.","I should also point out that the unfavorable development in homeowners and other this quarter did not result from any change in our reserve setting philosophy or methodologies. As we\u2019ve stated in the past and in our Qs and Ks, we always book to our best estimates and we use our advanced data and analytics to respond as quickly as we can to new information.","By its nature, reserve development is episodic and in lines like homeowners and other, much of it has historically related to truing up estimated losses caused by storm damage. The number of severe storms in recent reporting periods, their timing in relation to the reporting period in which they occurred, the causes and severity of the losses such as wind versus water, the actual size and extent of any hail, the actual amount of additional living expenses provided, et cetera has and will cause significant fluctuations in reserve development from period to period. And changes in levels of reserve development should not be regarded as a \u201ctrend.\u201d","Ex-A&E on a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development year-to-date. While CMP currently looks as if it developed unfavorably year-to-date by $37 million, as I pointed out in the second quarter, there was offsetting favorable development in the property product line as middle market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year-end 2015 was subsequently determined to be CMP-related.","Operating cash flows of 1.77 billion were very strong this quarter. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.8 billion and all of our capital ratios remained at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $3.1 billion pre-tax or 2 billion after-tax, up from 2 billion and 1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year while book value per share of $86.04 and adjusted book value per share of $78.82 increased 8% and 5%, respectively, also from the beginning of the year.","We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned 755 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of 193 million and share repurchases of 562 million. And year-to-date, we returned nearly 2.3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn things over to Brian.","Brian MacLean","Thanks, Jay. I\u2019ll start with business in international insurance where we had another good quarter, with strong returns and production results. We were very pleased that retention remained at historically high levels while we achieved positive renewal premium change and solid new business results.","Turning to the financial results for the segment, operating income was $457 million with the combined ratio of 96.1%. The underlying combined ratio was 94.7, up 2.2 points compared to the prior year. The increase in the underlying loss ratio was driven primarily by non-cat weather, which was higher than both the prior year quarter and our expectation and about three quarters of a point impact from loss cost trends in excess of earned pricing. These were partially offset by lower large loss activity.","Turning to production, given the returns that we are generating in this segment, our focus continues to be on retention and so we\u2019re very pleased that retention for our domestic business remained at 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change was nearly 3 points including renewal rate change that was slightly positive, while we produced new business of $431 million.","Turning to the individual businesses, in select, retention continued to remain strong at 82% while renewal premium change was over 5 points and we\u2019re quite pleased that new business was up 7% over the prior year. In middle market, retention of 87% remained at a historical high with renewal premium change of over 2 points. New business dollars were essentially consistent with prior year with submissions, quotes and the number of new accounts written in the quarter up. The average size of accounts written was down slightly versus last year, but we're encouraged by the increased activity.","In other business insurance, on Page 12, you can see that rate and RPC both improved in the quarter and retention remains strong. New business of $124 million was down compared to the third quarter of 2015, reflecting continued disciplined underwriting for larger accounts where we don't feel that market pricing will allow us to achieve target returns.","In international, we achieved 82% retention with positive renewal premium change and a 46% increase in new business volume, resulting in a 4% increase in net written premiums excluding the impact of foreign exchange. These increases were driven by our new global construction and renewable energy groups in Lloyd's and continued success in Canada with our recently introduced personal lines auto product Optima. So all-in, a good quarter for the segment with strong production and profitability.","Turning to bond and specialty insurance, this business continues to perform exceptionally well. Operating income for the quarter of $146 million was down from the prior year quarter driven primarily by a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 77.4 remains strong and well within our target return levels.","On top line, net written premiums for the quarter were flat to the prior year. Across our management liability businesses, retention remained at historically high levels and new business volumes were up, as we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best accounts and writing more business in our return adequate product segments. So bond and specialty results remained terrific, and we continue to feel great about the segment's performance and execution in the marketplace.","I\u2019ll now turn to personal insurance. Alan touched on the highlights. We once again had a solid quarter with a combined ratio of 92.9 and net written premiums reaching an all-time high of $2.2 billion. Auto continues to be the bigger factor driving the growth but homeowners\u2019 growth continues to accelerate as well, and both products generated strong retention and new business levels.","We believe being a portfolio provider sets us apart in the marketplace and we remain pleased with the financial performance of the overall segment. The third quarter underlying combined ratio of 91% was impacted by an adjustment to our auto loss ratio that I'll discuss in a moment and year-to-date underlying combined ratio of 88.9 remained strong, a very good result.","Looking at auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 101.1, up about 5 points from the prior year. About 4.5 points of this increase was due to the year-to-date impact of an adjustment we made to the loss ratio related to bodily injury severity for 2016, which, for the most part, reflects higher severity in our smaller claims. About 3 points of that increase relates to the first two quarters of this year.","With respect to this change, I want to emphasize a few points. First, as Alan said, we believe this is environmental in nature; that is we are seeing it across all our auto products both in personal and commercial lines. Second, what we are seeing is from the last four accident quarters and for a long tail line like auto liability, that is very recent activity.","Lastly, while we have been closely watching and talking to you about auto bodily injury severity for a number of years and reflecting it in our underwriting claim, pricing and reserving, recently severity has increased to a level that\u2019s a little more than we anticipated. In response to this recent trend, we\u2019re taking the appropriate pricing actions.","Looking at auto frequency, overall year-to-date 2016 frequency is generally in line with our long-term view. That said, we have seen some texture within the year. Collision frequency for the first half of the year was favorable to our long-term view while the third quarter was unfavorable. We believe the frequency volatility that we've seen in 2016 reflects normal period-to-period fluctuations.","As always, we are watching the data closely and will adjust if and when appropriate. But as of now, we have not changed our long-term frequency expectations. For perspective, the net adjustments we have made year-to-date related to collision frequency have less than the $3 million after-tax unfavorable impact. Normally, we wouldn't talk about a variance this small but given the amount of recent industry discussion on the topic, we felt that disclosure would be helpful.","We've also been talking to you about the impact of tenure on our auto loss ratio for a while. So let me take a few minutes to walk you through the slide on Page 19 that we've added to demonstrate the impact of tenure on a loss ratio. Exhibit 1 in the upper left illustrates the underlying dynamic that drives the impact of tenure, namely that the loss ratio of the given cohort of business improves over time as poor-performing business defects and pricing segmentation improves on the business that is retained.","Moving to Exhibits 2 through 4, of course, any given calendar period consist of a number of cohorts ranging from new to multiple years of age. In these exhibits, the curved line represents loss ratio by tenure, think policy year. The vertical bars represent premium volume remaining for those years and the horizontal line is the calendar period loss ratio for all cohorts, which is a premium weighted average of the loss ratio of each cohort of business during that calendar period.","Exhibit 2 demonstrates a steady state growth scenario, think base case. During periods of consistent growth, the newer cohorts blend with the older ones and the calendar period loss experience will generate the target loss ratio. Exhibit 3 illustrates the impact of a higher new business growth environment where calendar period results are more heavily influenced by the newer cohorts of business that naturally have a higher loss ratio. This drives the calendar period loss ratio higher.","Exhibit 4 illustrates a return to steady state growth at the higher levels of premium volume. The balance between the older and newer cohorts improves the calendar period loss ratio returns target levels, and in addition increased volume brings additional profit dollars. So obviously these are theoretical illustrations that raise a few important questions for our business.","First, what is the current impact of tenure on our auto loss ratio? And the answer is that our loss ratio is about 2 points higher than it would've been excluding this tenure impact. Second, do we believe that our Quantum Auto 2.0 product is performing as expected? And the answer to this is that it has been maturing in line with our loss ratio expectations.","Of course, we manage the business at a very granular level and monitor the book across multiple dimensions. For example, loss cost, retention and other proxies of profitability such as limits profile, prior experience and insurance score. In aggregate, based on all the data we have we believe this business is on track to produce appropriate returns. We clearly realized that the product is still relatively new in the marketplace having launched late in 2013, but three years in we are very pleased with the performance.","Turning to homeowners, the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was a very strong 78.3, although up about 7 points year-over-year due primarily to an unusually low amount of non-catastrophe weather-related losses last year. The current quarter results is in line with our expectations and we remain very pleased with the returns we're seeing in this business. So stepping back from a lot of moving pieces in the quarter, this is a franchise with a year-to-date combined ratio of 94.1% and 9% premium growth; results we feel very good about.","With that, let me turn it back to Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. We can now start the Q&A portion please. Before we get started, if I could please ask you to limit yourself to one question and one follow up, so we can get as many people on the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan","Thank you. Good morning. First, my condolences to the Travelers\u2019 family. My first question is on the personal auto, thanks for the detailed explanation. If I look at the year-over-year, like for first nine months, the deterioration by 2.6 points underlying combined ratio, you explained about 2 points coming from new business and another point maybe coming from the rising severity re-estimates about $29 million for the first nine months. Is that the right way to think about it is that these two factors has driven the underlying combined ratio going higher? And then if you see your outlook, you\u2019re expecting actually improvements in the combined ratio into 2017. I just wonder what\u2019s that coming from; is that coming from the last track [ph], from the new business penalty going forward or anything else. Thanks.","Brian MacLean","So, Kai, it\u2019s Brian MacLean and let me clarify just a couple of things. So the two points that I referenced in my comments are that the loss ratio is elevated. You went to the delta year-over-year. That\u2019s about one point. So if you're thinking of where our combined ratio or loss ratio is relative to what it should be without it, it\u2019s 200 basis points but the year-over-year change, only 100. Another thing that when speaking \u2013 a lot of our commentary was to loss ratio and importantly remember in this business, as we rolled out Quantum, it was really built around a pretty decent change to our cost structure. So the expense ratio is seeing some benefit and going forward will see more as volume increases. So if you're talking combined ratio, there is an expense ratio good guy in there. The basic dynamics of what you were mentioning though are the right components.","Alan Schnitzer","Kai, it\u2019s Alan. As to the outlook, you're right. We did suggest it was going down slightly and we\u2019ve identified in the outlook three moving pieces. One, a lower level of loss activity just returning to a more normal level, rate versus trend as given our outlook for rate and loss trend and that's offset by the continued adverse impact to tenure.","Kai Pan","Okay, that\u2019s great. Then a follow-up question. Do you have any early indication from potential losses from Hurricane Matthew in the fourth quarter?","Alan Schnitzer","Kai, we anticipated that and we\u2019re happy to give you an early range but I do want to indicate that we\u2019re just three weeks post storm, so it\u2019s still early for us. And it could be influenced from here through the end of the quarter by large BI claims that come up that we haven\u2019t identified yet. So we would say our range at this point is $75 million to $150 million and that\u2019s pre-tax. And again, the risk factor going forward is going to be claims that we haven\u2019t seen or don\u2019t know of yet but they could come in between now and the end of the quarter.","Kai Pan","Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner of FBR. Please proceed with your question.","Randy Binner","Good morning and thanks. I wanted to just talk on severity and just to understand what it is a little bit better. Is it that the actual injury and the bodily injury in these accidents is worse or is it a process by which claims are being used more to cover various medical conditions or is it a function of more aggressive trial bar or is it all three? I\u2019m trying to understand what it is that\u2019s actually driving the severity higher on the auto?","Alan Schnitzer","Randy, it\u2019s Alan. I\u2019d say you got it right sort of across the board. Generally speaking, we are seeing a high level of severity generally in the smaller claims and it\u2019s a little bit more aggressive litigation and a little bit more complexity in those smaller cases. You can\u2019t turn on the TV without seeing some kind of advertisement from the trial bar, so it\u2019s hard to pinpoint it with a high degree of specificity, but generally all those things.","Randy Binner","Maybe the follow up then is you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing it across your commercial and personal auto book in small case, if I got that right. So is it \u2013 what\u2019s the similarity across the classes and is it more people being involved in accidents, is that a piece of it too?","Alan Schnitzer","In some cases, there are more accidents of the vehicles and in some cases that is driving it. And generally we can just tell you that we see the same phenomenon across both books, commercial and personal.","Randy Binner","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar of Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning. I was wondering \u2013 the first question is, if you could better help me understand the auto BI uptake. You\u2019ve obviously cited outside environmental factors, yet there was modest re-estimation for the first half of 2016. Why would that not be a Travelers specific issue? And if you look at other companies such as Allstate and The Hartford who have had similar issues, what you have learned is this is rarely a one quarter issue. So maybe just help me understand why it\u2019s external and not internal?","Brian MacLean","So this is Brian, let me do a couple of pieces of that. First, when we look at claim experience across our business and we see it in personal lines, in recently written business, legacy long tenured business across pretty much the entire spectrum of customer profile and we see it in our commercial business from small to large trucking, that tells that this isn\u2019t something specific to our underwriting some product we have a marketplace. So it would be in our view highly unlikely that we\u2019d see it that broad based and have it be just our issue. I would also talk to \u2013 I would completely agree with the comment that auto liability, any liability line of business, it\u2019s hard to see clarity in the near term. And so we\u2019re constantly watching these events. I am very confident though that we\u2019re as on top of this as anybody. And for reference I\u2019d say look back to commentary we had going back as far as 2011, 2012 into 2013. We were talking about liability trends, what we were seeing in the auto product relative to distracted driving relative to increased litigation relative to increased utilization of medical diagnostic tools and the impacts on bodily injury. And to be totally honest, there were a couple of years there where we were getting a lot of questions from folks on this call about why are you seeing something that no one else is talking about? And over the years, I think everybody has been talking about it. So I\u2019m not saying that we\u2019ve got it perfectly right or we ever do, but we\u2019re looking at the trends very, very closely. And what we\u2019ve seen in the last three or four accident quarters has been somewhat of an elevation, as we said, particularly on the lower end of the claim size but driving more complexity.","Alan Schnitzer","I would also add. It didn\u2019t take us completely by surprise. Our loss PIPs [ph] had anticipated some increased severity. This was just a tick higher than we anticipated.","Amit Kumar","My second question is in the opening comments you talked about pricing actions. Does that indicate that we should anticipate a slowdown in Quantum growth? Why or why not? Thanks.","Alan Schnitzer","So I\u2019m going to let Michael Klein jump in on that one.","Michael Klein","Sure. This is Michael. I would say the impact on growth will depend upon how our pricing actions compare to those taken in the marketplace. What I can tell you and it\u2019s very incremental, but if you look at the production statistics on the webcast, you\u2019ll see our pricing rise quarter-over-quarter relative to where we were in 2015, and yet the growth has increased. So our view of where we sit currently is while we have taken some price increases above where we were running, our competitive position so far has actually remained consistent, if not improved and you\u2019re seeing actually increased growth this quarter relative to the couple of quarters before. To the degree that we\u2019re right about this being environmental and we think it is, we believe the marketplace will respond and we think that our pricing actions will be sort of absorbed in the market. Could it have an impact on growth, it certainly could. But again, to the degree we think it\u2019s environmental we think we\u2019ll be in line what\u2019s going on in the marketplace.","Amit Kumar","Just a quick follow up to that. Would it actually be prudent to say we\u2019re trying to get a better handle on this issue, let\u2019s just pull back on growth? Let\u2019s get this piece right and then come back on the growth trajectory?","Michael Klein","What I would say to that is we are addressing what we\u2019re seeing with our pricing actions and focused on making sure we\u2019ve got the right price in the marketplace. The growth will be what it will be as a result, but our focus is on getting the right terms and conditions in the market to respond to this change that we\u2019ve just seen.","Amit Kumar","Thanks\u2026","Alan Schnitzer","That\u2019s exactly right. We\u2019re trying to get the right price on the right account. And based on that and the market reaction will determine the degree to which we grow.","Amit Kumar","I\u2019ll stop here. Thank you for the answers.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Good morning. First on the personal auto book as well, when you guys think about your margin outlook in Q4 and into 2017, what type of increase in rates are you expecting from what we saw in the third quarter? And then as we think about the margin in the fourth quarter, I guess given the fact that you added to the current accident year, should we look for a sequential improvement in the auto underlying margin? And then one other, you guys did mention adding to the four recent accident quarters, so was there prior year adverse development on the auto book for 2015?","Alan Schnitzer","So that was a lot and quickly, so let me try to address what I caught and then maybe I\u2019ll ask you to repeat what we didn\u2019t get to. So I think you asked for the outlook on rate in auto. We don\u2019t give outlook on rate. We do provide outlook on overall price. And so I think you\u2019ll see that generally we are forecasting an increase in renewal price change, which is all-in rate and exposure. We don\u2019t quantify it any more than that other to say an increase. And I\u2019m sorry, Elyse, what were the other questions?","Elyse Greenspan","Well, I was looking \u2013 You guys had mentioned adding to the auto losses for the four most recent accident quarters, so were there adverse development on 2015?","Alan Schnitzer","There was a very little bit of adverse in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s obviously in the overall net PYD number, but it\u2019s a very small think after-tax single-digit number.","Gabriella Nawi","Elyse, it\u2019s Gabby. I think if I\u2019ve understood your question correctly on the current year prior quarter addition, it was 30 million pre-tax related to the first six months and then there was roughly \u2013 which means 15 million a quarter, which continued in the third quarter\u2019s '16 and can then use in the fourth quarter '16. Is that your question?","Alan Schnitzer","I interpreted your question to be, is there anything in prior year development related to this?","Elyse Greenspan","Yes, that was the question.","Alan Schnitzer","And the answer to that is in the overall net number of prior year developments, there is a single digit after-tax million dollar number in the fourth quarter.","Michael Klein","This is Michael Klein, offset by other items so there is no adverse prior year development in auto. That number is zero.","Alan Schnitzer","And there always is in PYD over the various accident years if you\u2019re going one way or another and the aggregate of those things was zero.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then one, if I may switch topics a little bit, in terms of your commercial line pricing view, with inflation levels looking like they could be picking up and reserved cushions for you guys and maybe some others starting to slow overall for the industry, do you think that it\u2019s time that some companies look to take price to kind of get ahead of the infection point if current trends continue as they are?","Alan Schnitzer","It\u2019s hard to answer that. I certainly can\u2019t answer that question for anybody else. You can see what our pricing has done and in our pricing, the headline number you see is really the aggregate of the many thousands of transactions that we complete during the quarter. And you can see that it picked up a little bit. I will tell you that generally speaking, we feel like we are achieving the written margins that we\u2019re seeking to achieve today and feel pretty good about their product returns given where the tenure is. We do give you some outlook in the 10-Q for underwriting margins. So we\u2019ll see where the market goes.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Jay Gelb","Thanks very much. On the excess capital position for the company, clearly Travelers continues to buy back stock and increase its dividend, although that pace of capital return has slowed for the year-to-date compared to the same period in 2015. I\u2019m trying to get a perspective on how much excess capital you feel Travelers holds now in excess of rating agency requirements?","Jay Benet","Hi, Jay. This is Jay. You\u2019ve asked the question in the past and when we go back to what we\u2019ve said at those times as well as in our Qs and Ks, ultimately it\u2019s going to be the earnings level of the company that\u2019s going to drive how much we return to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As it relates to the specifics of excess capital, we try to manage the operating companies of two what the rating agencies require of us as it relates to being an AA company. In any given quarter, based on profitability of that quarter, we might end up with a little extra capital. I think it\u2019s very, very rare that we end up with anything less than we need. So it\u2019s not a significant number and it\u2019s just going to vary from timing. Ultimately, we carry our rating agency capital level in line with the AA over time and we return the excess. We don\u2019t sit on the excess capital.","Jay Gelb","All right, thanks for clarifying that. Alan, on the merger and acquisition front, essentially all the growth it seems in Travelers this year is coming from personal lines with little overall top line growth in commercial insurance. Is there any interest in accelerating the commercial insurance growth through acquisitions?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, Jay, we always give the same answer to that question. I can\u2019t tell you whether we will or we won\u2019t but I can tell you that I think our shareholders should demand that we have a view on what the attractive businesses are in every market that we operate in or might want to operate in and have a view on whether we won\u2019t to do them. We do think that we\u2019ve come together over a couple of decades through a lot of transactions. We feel like it\u2019s a competitive advantage for us. We\u2019re good at finding them. We\u2019re good doing the diligence. We\u2019re good at negotiating them. We\u2019re good at integrating them. So we feel highly qualified to do it and under the right terms and conditions, interested in doing it. Having said that, over the years we\u2019re also highly attentive to the risks; you buy the entire balance sheet, you buy system issues, you buy people issues. So we\u2019re very \u2013 I\u2019d say we\u2019re very aware on both sides of the analysis. But we are certainly interested in doing things if we can get them done on the right terms. And generally speaking for us, those are \u2013 we think about it through the lens of returns. Will a transaction improve our return profile and\/or will it improve our volatility. And so that\u2019s the lens and we\u2019re always interested in looking.","Jay Gelb","That makes sense, Alan. Would that include large deals as well, something that might require issuing shares?","Alan Schnitzer","Jay, I wouldn\u2019t make any distinction between a large deal and a small deal. All I can tell you is what the lens is through which we would evaluate it.","Jay Gelb","Thank you.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Charles Sebaski","Good morning. Thanks. I guess the first one, just a follow up back on personal auto really quickly. And I guess the question\u2019s on the timing of the rate actions that you guys took and what I\u2019m trying to figure out is with regard to the growth. While the PIF growth was obviously very strong, I\u2019m wondering if the severity issues were recognized at the close of the quarter and the rating actions are going to be perspective or these were rating actions that were taken at the beginning of the quarter and the 11% PIF growth was after those rating actions took place?","Michael Klein","Charles, this is Michael. I would say that we have been putting some rate into the market, first of all, throughout the year. The filed rate has started to rise in the quarter. I would say the growth in the quarter reflects some of that activity but just a little bit, and there\u2019s more to come.","Charles Sebaski","Excellent. Thank you. And then a follow up on the weather and the commentary on higher losses from non-cat weather. You guys already provide a lot of detail, which is very helpful. I\u2019m just wondering if you could help us out a little further and give some kind of baseline of what weather losses are intended, I guess particularly maybe in like a homeowners line of business? I guess the commentary that losses are higher or lower in a particular period due to higher non-cat weather that isn\u2019t specific identified without a baseline is color what\u2019s hard to model or understand. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s some clarity you could give on a baseline for us on what non-cat weather should be and what the volatility is that through the year?","Alan Schnitzer","Charles, it\u2019s Alan. I do appreciate the question and why you want to know and also I\u2019d just thank you for acknowledging the fact that we do give a lot of color and texture and we try to be very thoughtful about that. This is one that we think a lot about and we think it\u2019s hard to do for a couple of reasons. One is, weather is just inherently unpredictable. There\u2019s a lot of volatility obviously and we don\u2019t know. We do have a plan. We do price for weather, but that reflects generally speaking longer term trends. So we just don\u2019t feel like it would be particularly meaningful for us to give you a plan for next quarter or next year just given the volatility. So we shy away from getting that specific relative to our expectations. But what I will tell you in case it\u2019s helpful is one a year-to-date basis for the company, weather was about \u2013 non-cat weather was about $70 million worse after-tax than it was in the prior year. So I know that\u2019s not exactly what you asked for. Maybe that\u2019s a little bit of color that would be helpful. But we\u2019re just a little bit hesitant to start giving you plan numbers.","Charles Sebaski","I appreciate the answers. Thanks a lot, guys.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Michael Nannizzi","Thanks so much. Just back to auto for a second, if I could. Is it possible to kind of understand where the action quarter loss ratio is here at the beginning of the fourth quarter, or just post these adjustments that you made to the current calendar year in the third quarter? And then where is that relative to kind of where you wanted that business to be running when the sort of Quantum 2.0 effort began?","Alan Schnitzer","I guess we\u2019re looking at each other trying to understand exactly what it is you\u2019re asking. If you\u2019re looking for a view on fourth quarter, we\u2019re not really inclined to give any information about the fourth quarter yet.","Michael Nannizzi","How about where did the third quarter end? In terms of \u2013 so you made the adjustments to the third quarter, so I would imagine if you\u2019re thinking about your prospective trend then you\u2019re going to start with the third quarter, you\u2019re going to look at rate and then you\u2019re going to look at loss. I\u2019m just trying to get an idea of what\u2019s your starting point for new business today?","Alan Schnitzer","Stepping back, if you look at it on the nine months and you look at PI auto, the underlying combined ratio was about 98. Is that helpful?","Michael Nannizzi","Yes.","Alan Schnitzer","That\u2019s for the nine months in PI and that\u2019s on an underlying basis ex-cat and ex-PYD.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. And so that\u2019s in our numbers. Has that changed throughout the year or is that just kind of back to shareholders?","Michael Klein","Michael, this is Michael. I would just say, so for context on that underlying right, Brian talked about the fact that there\u2019s a point of impact from tenure year-on-year in that number. The other thing is if you take the bodily injury severity number and decompose that 45 million by quarter, it\u2019s about 1.5 on a run rate basis for the year-to-date. That 1.5 we expect to go forward into the fourth quarter. And the other thing I would say, just clarification on the fourth quarter outlook, the fourth quarter outlook says that we expect the combined ratio to be higher in the fourth quarter. There is a seasonality impact underneath that number, right. The combined ratio and the loss ratio in the fourth quarter run higher in the fourth quarter than they do in the first three quarters of the year. And so that\u2019s part of what\u2019s underneath that outlook number as well.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. I guess one question I have, Quantum is \u2013 it sounds like it\u2019s been very effective in a lot of ways. We\u2019ve seen PIF growth, the acceptance in the market, all of those things seem like a real positive. And then we have the sort of environmental trend that has been occurring like fits and spurts over the last couple of years. So taking those things separately, is it possible that the growth that you\u2019ve seen just might have occurred at a difficult time sort of before some of these loss trends emerged? And following up on a prior question, should that imply that at some point we should see that growth revert back until you calibrate those things, or is this still within your sort of expectations when you rolled out Quantum?","Alan Schnitzer","So let\u2019s go back a few years to where we were three or four years ago or two or three years ago when this business was shrinking in double digits. So we put Quantum Auto in and we took a lot of cost out, and we\u2019ve dramatically improved the overall profile of the business. So we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of that. This has been a big success. And a lot of the growth you\u2019re seeing is high in percentage terms, because it\u2019s off a smaller base after a couple years of shrinking. So, that\u2019s I think just important context to keep in mind. We don\u2019t go out there and try to manage the growth. We try to go out there based on everything that we see and price for the return that we\u2019re looking for. And based on the market, we\u2019ll grow or we won\u2019t grow. We feel very good about the growth. Maybe we don\u2019t have it exactly right, maybe we\u2019ll have to adjust, I\u2019m not really sure and honestly we could be adjusting up or down, not really sure. And this isn\u2019t unusual for any line of business that we have. As I said before, cost trends are going to change for one reason or another. We\u2019ve got other trends in other parts of our business that have emerged favorably. And so we watch these things, we think having the diagnostics and the ability to understand it, to diagnose it, to price for it is what\u2019s really important.","Michael Nannizzi","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Jay Cohen","Thank you. I guess we hit most of the issues on the auto side. Can you give us an update on the workers\u2019 comp business? It feels like it\u2019s been relatively stable. Are you seeing any changes in that environment, either pricing or claims?","Alan Schnitzer","I would say continued stable environment, no real change in the trends. Obviously, we had a couple of court cases in Florida that the overall market has reacted to and we\u2019ve reacted to. Those dollars weren\u2019t enormous for us. I think last year we had something on the order of $34 million, $35 million pre-tax that we added the reserves for those two court cases, so relatively minor for us. But other than that, no real trends from workers\u2019 comp.","Jay Cohen","Great. Thanks, Alan.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Tunis","Thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on thinking about the BI severity on the commercial auto side. It sounds like you guys are flagging this as an environmental issue kind of across all the wheels business. Is there a way that you can maybe help us think about the impact that had year-over-year on the loss ratio in commercial just from the severity in commercial auto?","Alan Schnitzer","Ryan, what I\u2019ll tell you is on the business insurance side, the proportion of premium that comes from auto is just much smaller than the same is true for the PI segment. So overall, the numbers are just less significant to that segment. There were some small numbers but nothing all that significant. The other thing I\u2019d point out is on the commercial line side, we have more flexibility to change pricing more quickly than we do on the personal line side.","Brian MacLean","The other thing I would add, Ryan, this is Brian is when you really look at the commercial exposure, when you\u2019re thinking of smaller claims that could be more of a PI thing. So the actual \u2013 we did have some activity on the severity side in BI this quarter. The dollars were actually less than PI. Obviously, as Alan said, the percentage was dramatically less. We actually had a little bit of good news from frequency in the current year; again, small dollars. So you don\u2019t see the impact as much, so a bunch of different factors going into it.","Ryan Tunis","Okay, understood. And then I guess a follow up for Brian, I guess, on the impact of tenure. So I guess over the last couple years, it\u2019s been 2 points. If we would have had this conversation a year ago, it would have been 1. So the new business penalty I guess has grown year-over-year. And I guess this introduces the question of just how and over what time period can we really get that 2 points back? I guess especially when you think about the fact that Quantum 2, it seems like it\u2019s supposed to be a more competitively priced product. So over time, there should be a higher percentage of premium in new business. Just anything you can give us on getting that 2 points back, and whether or not you can get it back and keep growth anywhere close to where it is for Quantum? Thanks.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, so a couple of things and again this is back to the theoretical example. Although not possible, if you keep growing \u2013 you keep trying to chasing it, but if you keep growing with business that you believe has lifetime value that\u2019s meeting your returns, then it\u2019s all a good thing. And I get that that\u2019s a theoretical comment. We\u2019re not going to disclose exactly what the timing is, because that would lead someone to be able to triangulate exactly how we\u2019re pricing in the returns that we\u2019re \u2013 specific returns we\u2019re targeting. But the answer is, it\u2019s kind of a function of what do you think is going to happen to our growth. It\u2019s not going to reverse in the next year or two. It\u2019s going to take a while to play out. The other thing that is certainly worth noting is we talk a lot about the ratio. As we grow and it performs, we\u2019re generating profit dollars that are incremental to the franchise and obviously that\u2019s a good thing.","Ryan Tunis","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning. In the Q, you provide guidance that the personal auto combined ratio on an underlying basis could improve in 2017. What are your assumptions in terms of the auto BI severity there? Do you assume any further uptick or is that a risk?","Michael Klein","This is Michael. I would say what we\u2019ve said is that auto severity uptick is about 1.5 on a run rate basis. We assume that continues on a go-forward basis. There\u2019s always a risk it could change from here, it could change up, it could change down. When you look at the outlook, the outlook reflects the comments we\u2019ve made this morning that we\u2019re responding with price, and so the outlook I think literally says we believe price will exceed loss trend, which will be a good guy. The outlook says I believe that offsets some continued adverse impact from tenure. And then the other big component is an expectation about more normalized loss levels, which relates a little bit to the non-cat weather conversation we\u2019ve been having this morning and just a broader more consistent expectation on the loss level. So, again, I think the pricing and the outlook anticipate that the bodily injury severity, the higher levels of bodily injury severity are with us going forward but we\u2019re responding with price and believe that we\u2019ll get price ahead of loss trend in '17.","Sarah DeWitt","Great. Thanks for the answer.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","This will be our last question. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Our last question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg of Janney. Please proceed with your question.","Larry Greenberg","Thanks and good morning. And just about all my questions were answered, but I have one nerdy one. In the bond line \u2013 were you waiting for that, Gabby?","Gabriella Nawi","No, it\u2019s just it\u2019s such a great business and nobody ever ask questions. If we can inadvertent cheer for [indiscernible].","Larry Greenberg","The underlying loss ratio improved a few points. And I\u2019m just wondering, was there any re-estimation of the first half here similar to what you did a year ago in the third quarter?","Alan Schnitzer","There was a re-estimation in the quarter, yes, and it was an improvement loss ratio of 2.3 points. And so that\u2019s when you pull the first two quarters back in and add what\u2019s into the third quarter. So, yes, that\u2019s correct.","Larry Greenberg","Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you all for joining.

Ms. Nawi, you may begin.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you, Tina. Good morning and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2012 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the investors section.","Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions.","Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.","Also, in our remarks and responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the investors section on our website.","And now, Jay Fishman.","Jay S. Fishman","Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report a very strong start to 2012 driven by solid underwriting as well as investment results.","In the quarter, we produced net income of $806 million or $2.02 per share and generated a 13.1% return on equity and a 14.7% operating return on equity. Even excluding the impact of net favorable prior-year development, which states the returns on an absolute year basis, the corresponding percentages are 9.9% and 11.1%. Net income of $806 million compares to $839 million last year, but last year included a $104 million benefit from the favorable resolution of prior-year tax matters.","As we've shared with you previously, our current operating focus is simple and on course. Given the potential for continued severe weather in the United States as well as the outlook for continued low interest rates, we remain committed to improving our profitability by actively but selectively seeking price increases and improved terms and conditions on the products we sell.","In Business Insurance, we continued to achieve improved pricing. Renewal rate change in the quarter was a positive 8%, up from 6% in the fourth quarter of 2011, while retention remained stable. Importantly, we believe that we differentiate ourselves from many in the marketplace by not taking a \"one size fits all\" approach to pricing. In our individual underwriting businesses, each customer's needs, characteristics, geographies and risk and loss profile is different, and as such, each transaction is analyzed and priced separately. In Select Accounts, analyzing the returns we earn from our insured\u2019s industry segment in conjunction with the individual insured characteristics is critical to success.","We continue to leverage what we believe is industry-leading data and analytics to help us optimize rate and retention, that is, achieving higher retentions on our best customer relationships while simultaneously identifying the walk away point for our least-profitable relationships. This differentiation is best evidenced by an analysis of rate and retention by historical loss ratio performance that Brian will share with you later. We're very pleased how we're executing in the field, and this analysis summarize and demonstrates the effectiveness of our analytics and the thoughtful way we're approaching business pricing.","In our Personal Insurance segment, we continue to take the necessary actions to increase returns, which include improved pricing, terms and conditions. Renewal price change in the quarter improved in automobile and Homeowners to 4% and 10%, respectively. In many states, we have implemented higher deductibles and changes to underwriting terms and conditions predominantly for new business. And while Personal Insurance new business in these states has been and may continue to be impacted for some time following these changes, we are convinced we are on the right course.","I want to take just a moment to acknowledge the work our financial professional and international groups have done in recent years. Within FP&II, there are numerous businesses and product lines, each with its own individual story, but in the aggregate, we recorded a 24% improvement in profitability quarter-over-quarter and are more comfortable with our risk profile and better positioned for opportunity in our international business than we have been in the past. Additionally, the fact that our surety and Management Liability businesses have performed as well as they have is a real testament to risk management scale, especially given the economic environment over the last several years. The solid work these teams have done and continue to do is evidenced in their strong results.","Lastly, I'm also pleased to report that our Board of Directors approved a 12% increase in the company's quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.46 per share. This brings our annual yield, based on last night's closing price, up to 3.1% from 2.8%. Since the merger of St. Paul and Travelers in 2004, the dividend has increased each year and, over this time period, has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 10%. As always, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay S. Benet","Thanks, Jay.","I would characterize our first quarter results as being very strong and as having the following attributes: fixed income investment returns that were in line with our expectations; non-fixed income investment returns that benefited from strong equity market performance to the end of the quarter; underlying underwriting results that benefited from the significant price increases we have been achieving in recent months as well as growth in exposures and favorable audit premium adjustments; weather-related losses that were more or less within our expectations; and a relatively high level of net favorable prior-year reserve development. Brian is going to provide comments on our underwriting results, but before he does, let me say a few words about our reserves and their development.","The strength of our reserves is evidenced by the net favorable prior-year reserve development we continue to experience: $200 million after tax in the first quarter, up from $155 million in last year's first quarter. While each segment once again reported net favorable prior-year reserve development, the Business Insurance segment was responsible for $162 million or approximately 80% of the total. BI's net favorable prior-year reserve development was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in general liability for the 2004 through 2009 accident years and commercial property for the 2010 accident year. Partially offsetting these favorable adjustments was the strengthening of our commercial auto reserves for the 2011 accident year due to higher-than-expected frequency and severity.","Financial, Professional & International Insurance contributed net favorable prior-year reserve development of $31 million after tax in the quarter, a little higher than last year's first quarter primarily due to the better-than-expected loss experience in our surety business within Bond & Financial Products for the 2006 through 2008 accident years as well as in several lines of business in Canada and Lloyd's.","Turning to financial strength indicators. All remain in excellent shape. First quarter operating cash flows were very strong at $814 million, a holding company liquidity of $2.2 billion and all of our capital ratios ended the quarter at or better than their target levels.","Net unrealized investment gains, which were $4.35 billion at the end of the quarter or $2.8 billion after tax, decreased only slightly from year end, entirely due to movements in interest rates and credit spreads, while book value per share rose to $63.81, 2% higher than the beginning of the year and 7% higher than a year ago.","And finally, as always, we remain fully committed to identifying and returning excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned a little over $500 million to our shareholders through common stock repurchases of $350 million and dividends of $162 million.","Brian is now going to provide further commentary on our underwriting results.","Brian W. MacLean","Thanks, Jay.","A great quarter on many levels. And from an underwriting perspective, our GAAP combined ratio of 92.2% was 2.5 points better than 2011, and adjusting for cats and prior-year reserve development, the combined was 94.6% or 1.1 points better than 2011. So a really good start to the year.","In Business Insurance, we are extremely pleased with our results this quarter. Operating income of $612 million was up slightly from a very good quarter last year, which included a $76 million tax benefit. Pricing continued to be very strong, with renewal premium change of 9% that included pure rate increases of 8%. Importantly, the improved rate that we achieved was broad based, with rate increases in all product lines between 6 and 9 points, with the workers comp and auto lines at the top end of that range.","Net written premiums were up year-over-year driven by these pricing gains as well as solid exposure growth and audit premiums. By line, the growth was driven by workers compensation, again resulting from price and exposure increases. For your reference, Page 9 of the webcast shows the reconciliation of net written premiums quarter-over-quarter, and we believe this speaks to a picture of improved profitability on the business.","Retentions remained solid, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2011 driven by improvements in commercial accounts. As you can see on Slide 11, Select Accounts retention has declined from 81% in the first quarter of 2011 to 75% in the current quarter. As we have discussed many times, our select business includes Select Express, the smaller-account-sized business; and Select Plus, the larger individually underwritten accounts.","In Express, retention has come down modestly and is currently at 78%. In Plus, retention is down much more significantly to 71%. In the Plus business, based on our view of account and segment profitability, the competition has continued to price business very aggressively and at returns we do not consider acceptable. Accordingly, our retention is the result of our active and very deliberate strategy to seek the appropriate price for each account, and we are very comfortable with this volume and profitability trade-off.","So stepping back to rate and retention for all of Business Insurance, we're very pleased with the results, but importantly, we're also very focused on how we got to those results. By that, I mean, did we get the rate increases where needed? And did we retain our best business?","An example of how we manage this approach is on Slide 14, which shows our rate change and retention data for commercial accounts segmented by the individual accounts' long-term loss ratio. So the bar on the left represents our best-performing business, accounts with long-term loss ratios of less than 60%, and the bar on the right represents our worst-performing accounts with long-term loss ratios exceeding 90%. You can see that the retention ratio was stronger for the better accounts and the rate change is dramatically higher on the poorer-performing accounts.","I want to emphasize 2 points. First, our actual pricing and underwriting decisions are made on individual accounts. Secondly, that this is -- this exhibit presents summarized data and we actually measure and manage our performance on a much more granular level: by business, by product line, by industry and by geography. And the conclusion is we feel great about how we're executing at those levels.","Turning to loss trend. Across Business Insurance, we are seeing loss inflation at about 4% overall, which is consistent with our expectations. As with the rate story, by line, there's a pretty tight range around that number, with workers comp and auto slightly above the average. Looking specifically at workers comp, the frequency increase we talked to you about in prior quarters has stabilized. And in commercial auto, we continue to see a modest pressure in bodily injury severity and in physical damage frequency and severity.","So in closing on Business Insurance, a critical takeaway: In the quarter, the earned impact of our pricing actions exceeded our current estimate of the quarter's loss trend by about 50 basis points. And this is obviously a step in the right direction.","In the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, we had another very strong quarter, with operating income of $149 million, up 24% from the prior year. The improvement is due to lower level of cat losses as well as improved underlying margins in our international business where we believe underwriting initiatives have resulted in a better balance of risk and reward.","Looking at production, Management Liability net written premiums were up 7% year-over-year as retention levels and renewal premium gains were at their highest levels in several years and new business volume was also strong. Management Liability is an area where we've made significant investments in technology and analytics, and the increased volume we are seeing shows that those investments are paying off. In addition, we are seeing the most growth in our more profitable lines.","In surety, volumes continued to be impacted by decreased construction spending, while in international, net written premiums were down $8 million or 3%, reflecting the impact of our decision to exit the personal lines business in Ireland, as well as an increase in ceded premium year-over-year. So all in, a very strong quarter for the segment.","In Personal Insurance, first quarter operating income, excluding cats and prior-year development, was $176 million, up 5% from the first quarter of 2011. The GAAP combined ratio, also excluding cats and prior year, was 92.3% and, excluding the impact of the direct-to-consumer initiative, 90.3%. So the underlying profitability, the agency business, was very solid.","Looking at production. In Agency Auto, renewal premium change was 4%, up 1 point from the fourth quarter, and retention remained strong at 83%. In agency property, we also saw improved pricing, with renewal premium change of 10%, up from 8% in the fourth quarter, along with continued strong retention. In both lines, new business volumes have been impacted by our pricing and underwriting actions.","Loss trends in home have remained within our expectations, while in auto, we continued to see severity pressures that we disclosed last quarter with a slight uptick in physical damage lines. Given the desire to improve auto margins that we discussed last quarter and the possibly of continued unusual weather patterns, we will continue to take the actions necessary to improve profitability in both auto and Homeowners. We've filed for additional rate increases in both products in a number of states. And in Homeowners, we've also continued to implement underwriting changes along with changes in terms and conditions, such as higher deductibles.","As with Business Insurance, we continually measure the balance between profitability and growth in a very granular way, and we remain very comfortable with our actions.","With that, I'll open it for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on insurance pricing levels. I know no one said that they've peaked, but they clearly are in excess of loss cost trends in most lines. Are you guys still seeing momentum there? And can you comment on Management Liability? Rates increased 4% there, do you think there's momentum in that specific line of business?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, Mike, so this is Brian MacLean. I'll start off. And speaking specifically to Business Insurance, I'd start by emphasizing and repeating what we just said, that we feel good about where the market was this past quarter. And the 8% rate, 9% total price and the retention levels we're getting and, specifically, where we're getting it by account and by type of business, we felt good about. Our position in the marketplace right now as we move forward is, we're not changing our strategy at all. We're looking to continue to prove -- improve our returns. You are absolutely right, that we're now at a point where we're earning in something in excess of our current view of loss trends. And we don't make long-term predictions on the market, but we do have pretty good visibility into what's going to happen 60 to 90 days out. We're obviously quoting business out there and we have a decent view into April. And so we feel good about what we're seeing in the second quarter and, from a written basis, feel that the momentum is somewhat continuing. So we feel very good about where we are.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, in regards to workers comp frequency stabilizing, could you comment on what level it's -- has stabilized at?","Brian W. MacLean","I don't know if we've specifically disclosed it, but it's...","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Would you say it's at a level that's going down in terms of the trend, the absolute level of frequency?","Jay S. Benet","This is Jay Benet. I think, in the fourth quarter, we've seen it level out. And we really haven't seen a change in the first quarter relative to what we have been seeing, so it's running within our expectations. Nothing has really changed.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, I mean, it's pretty close to 0, is what we're seeing and it's very stable.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And have rates, pricing, has that continued to improve on that line?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. I mean, we've -- workers comp is at the highest end of the price increases we're getting, and we feel good about what we've been able to do there. On the Management Liability side, Alan...","Alan D. Schnitzer","Mike, it's Alan Schnitzer. You asked about Management Liability pricing, as well. And you mentioned before, the pricing is actually up 2. Overall, RPC is up 4, and 1\/2 of that's rate and 1\/2 of it's exposure. We are -- it is our strategy to continue to try to get rate in those lines where we think we need it. And just based on our feel for the market and what we're doing 30, 60, 90 days out, we think there's some room for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie Group.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","The first question is on the discussion on retentions. Obviously, the retentions have trended down successively every quarter. And I'm just wondering, if you keep on pushing rates, do we get to somewhat of a low-70s retention number as we approach end of 2012? Or do you think that the retentions numbers are exhibiting some signs of stabilizing, going forward?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, so a couple responses to that. This is Brian. I'll start, and then -- let me start by saying that, historically, when we look at retentions in our core Business Insurance, at an 80% level, with the right execution and the right analytics, we feel that -- as a matter of fact, we don't have any doubt that we can perform very well at an 80% retention. We had said consistently, going back a year or so ago when we were running at 84, 85s, that those were at historical high levels and we did not expect to continue to have the business there. So we feel pretty good about where we are today from a retention perspective. As you pointed out, quarter-over-quarter, it went up a blip so fundamentally stable where it is. The other thing I would emphasize back to that exhibit we showed in the webcast: We look really hard at, as retentions move up or down, why they are moving up or down. And to state the obvious, but it's -- the execution on this is critical. If we're retaining our best business and retention is softening in the weaker business because the market -- because we can't get the price increases that we think we need, we're going to be perfectly fine with that trade-off. So we don't sit here with a magic number and say, if it gets to 75, we're at a panic level. If -- whatever. It's really about the composition of what's going on inside of it.","Jay S. Fishman","And this is Jay Fishman. I'd just add 2 quick comments. First, just to clarify, in Business Insurance, the retention was actually stable, dead on, first quarter to fourth quarter. So sequentially there, that was actually a tiny bit up. It rounds to a flat number, but it was actually the tiniest bit up. And so sequentially, it is right on. And I'd point also to Brian's comments about the Plus business. There's no question that, if we had a different strategy in Select Plus, the retention could be 5, 6, 7 points higher, but our analysis suggests that, that's not the way to create long-term value. And a lot of -- in many of these market segments, in fact in most, it's an active decision, not a passive reaction. We make the decision of the price-retention trade-off all the time. And the slide that Brian showed that ties loss ratios to retention in rate is absolutely critical in the analysis particularly as you get into a granular level. And we actually -- if you do some quick arithmetic on that slide, what you'll see is the summary of that slide shows an 18-point rate increase against accounts with a historical loss ratio or long-term loss ratio in excess of 90%. That -- the result, the arithmetic result of that is a 14% decline, not a 14-point decline but a 14% decline in the actual loss ratio. I mean, it's meaningful. So it's -- as you have the analytics and the ability to look at your book of business just as granularly as we do, we tend to view the retention as a result of thoughtful, well-executed strategies, not a target or a byproduct that's in effect for us -- on us.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Got it. That's helpful. Just one other question and this is a follow-up to the prior question. In terms of California comp, you mentioned that -- I'm sorry, the workers comp line, you said that the rates were at the highest end of the range. And I couldn't quite discern what exactly the number was, what you were alluding to, what exactly that number is. I think you mentioned the loss costs were 4%. Just trying to understand the delta between pricing and loss cost. And if I understand correctly, what you were suggesting in the prior answer was that, probably, the way you look at it, 2010 was the peak in terms of loss cost. And I know you've discussed that in the past, too.","Brian W. MacLean","So let me do a couple things and I'll repeat some of the stuff, just to make it clear. We said 8 points of rate increase between 6 and 9 by line, and comp was at the high end of that. So -- and then on the loss costs, I said 4% across all of BI, with a relatively tight band by product line around that. And comp is at the high end of that. I mean, comp and auto were the 2 lines where we're seeing the most loss pressure and we're seeing the highest rate increases. So we think there's rational behavior there.","Jay S. Fishman","And what Brian gave you in rate just a moment ago was the written rate increase. And importantly, he shared with you that the earned effect of the pricing strategy, not just rate but that portion of exposure that acts like rate, actually had an earned impact in the quarter of approximately 50 basis points higher than the -- than our current estimate of loss trend.","Brian W. MacLean","Right. Now you made a comment and I wasn't quite sure where you were going but that we implied that the fourth quarter was kind of the peak of...","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","No, the 2010. 2010 was the peak in terms of loss trend.","Gabriella Nawi","[indiscernible] Amit, this is Gabby. When Brian said the question we had been asked was workers comp frequency, which we were saying was essentially flat. But certainly, that is never implying that workers comp loss costs are flat. Obviously, we've always talked about the severity dynamics to it.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","So is it still going up, overall? Or you think that it's stabilized at this level?","Jay S. Fishman","Well, the question is what is -- that you're asking is, we're not exactly sure what you mean by it leveling. Our -- when you add in frequency and severity and you look at workers compensation -- and I'll say this without checking all the facts, but Gabby can. I think, in virtually every year, that it's a net positive inflation rate on loss costs that, even if severity -- even if frequency has been down, our assumption about the combination of medical inflation and indemnity inflation, both, more than offset whatever the underlying assumption has been even in a declining frequency arena. So our analysis always is that loss costs are always rising year-to-year.","Brian W. MacLean","Right. And then so the pieces we're giving...","Jay S. Fishman","As we've already [ph] said. Sometimes, we get favorable reserve development years later, and lots of you comment on that, where our initial loss estimates turned out to be way too high where, in one year, too low, and it obviously changes. But as we initially set them, we're always contemplating an increase in the inflation dynamic on a combined basis.","Brian W. MacLean","And I'll repeat the pieces we had given you, and I think they can get you pretty close. I mean, we just said frequency was about 0 across all of BI. Frequency Plus severity is about 4%, and comp's a little bit above that. So that, I think, gives you the pieces, yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Wanted to just ask about the buyback and the dividends. A very nice increase in the dividend in the quarter, but it looks to me like you -- the combined $500 million in buybacks and dividends was less than operating income. And I just wanted to -- and perhaps you said it in your commentary, but I just want to just reassess, what is the guidance for capital management, going forward? Is it 100% of operating income to be returned to shareholders?","Jay S. Benet","Yes, this is Jay Benet. We try to be as clear as we can about this in our 10-Q. So let me just reiterate a couple of points. First of all, just in terms of the magnitude in the first quarter, we did return, as I said, a little over $500 million, $350 million in the form of repurchases, the rest in terms of dividends. Obviously, we don't know the actual amount of earnings in a quarter until the quarter is over, so we are buying back our shares during the quarter based on some presumption of where we'll be. I'll remind you that, and this is what is written in the Q, the combination of dividends and share repurchases isn't likely to exceed the income for the year. And the share repurchases are also going to depend on a variety of factors. There are capital needs that we have as we grow our business. Maintaining capital levels commensurate with ratings. We do buybacks on the basis of having excess cash available. So we take into account pension funding needs and other corporate needs. So there's lots of things that go into it. And I wouldn't read from any particular quarter the earnings of the quarter versus the amount of the share repurchases as indicative of much of anything at this point.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then shifting gears, on the core margin side, excellent trends. Everything you're saying is sort of playing out in the reported numbers. The one thing I'm trying to tie, though, Brian, is you mentioned earned premium is ahead of losses -- loss trend by 50 basis points in Business Insurance. And yet, if we're doing our math right, it looks to me like the core margin for that specific unit actually deteriorated by 30 bps year-over-year, which is -- points to a very near-term inflection point for that division importantly. And so I'm trying to tie the \"earned premium to loss\" commentary with the reported number. And I guess the question will be, is there a lag? Or how should we be thinking about that in the models?","Brian W. MacLean","And I assume, when you say you're looking at the reported -- if I look at the x cats, x prior-year development combined ratio for Business Insurance, it was 96.4%. A year ago in the first quarter, it was 96%, but importantly, for the full year of 2011, it was 97.9%. So we've got some pretty significant improvement: It's come down 4 consecutive quarters. With all of that said, in any given quarter, there's going to be a lot of stuff that's going to go into the combined ratio that, when I talk about that core margin expansion, I'm not talking about unusual weather, I would -- so I'd be taking out favorable or unfavorable weather, large losses, mix of business changes. We could be moving something in the accident year that's going to distort that given quarter's GAAP combined ratio. So I think, in a specific quarter, there can be a lot going on. Obviously, as we go forward, we're going to speak to those things. But the core underlying margins showed some improvement in the quarter and bodes well for the future.","Jay S. Fishman","And while we -- Greg, this is Jay. Thanks for the question. It -- while we don't -- certainly don't want to make predictions about rates or anything else, the one thing that is quite just arithmetic and quite predictable is the effect of written rate because you can go back, you take 1\/12 of the previous month, plus 1\/12 of the month before that and 1\/12 of the month before that and you calculate the rate dynamic, and you can actually calculate the rate impact on premium, the earned rate impact. Now there's a portion that's not nearly as visible to outsiders. There's a portion of exposure that really looks like rate. It doesn't have loss cost associated with it, a change in valuation on a property. So there are elements, so we very granularly go through that. And so on the presumption that, that exposure piece stays the same quarter to quarter, what we can say with reasonable assurance, because things would have to change so dramatically is to be unlikely, is that the earned rate impact in the second quarter, earned rate, will be higher than the first. That's pretty ascertainable at this point. We don't know obviously what our second quarter view of loss trend is, and so it's very difficult to make predictions and feel like you're doing it in any substantive way, but the earned rate impact is really quite discernible.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Walsh of Citi.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Thanks for the slides on retention. Very helpful in the pack. Just getting back to Jay Fishman's comments earlier, on Slide 14. Can you talk a little bit about the elasticity of retention and the trade-off between raising rates on the really good loss ratio business that looks like it's sub-60 versus keeping more of it, retaining more and maybe not raising rate as much?","Jay S. Fishman","Yes, that's -- it's -- actually, it's a very good question and it really gets to the core of how we execute in the marketplace. The -- first, in its most simplistic form -- and you all are knowledgeable enough about our industry to understand it: If you get 1 point of rate, 85% of that, I'm taking 15 points of commissions and taxes, direct costs, if you will, fall right to the pretax line. So 1 point of rate is really quite powerful from a profitably standpoint. Now 1 point of retention has dramatically lower impact on profitability because you have all the loss costs associated with it. So you have the variable cost that goes up, but you also have the direct loss cost that goes with it. So it's quite easy to say that 1 point of rate is worth a multiple, 5x. And I'm guessing at that number, sitting here this morning, but 5x 1 point of retention. Now the -- that theory is good until your last account. At some point, it breaks down. But as we sit here looking at 1 point of rate on the margin versus 1 point of retention, that's a really easy call as long as we're being thoughtful about how it's executed. Now I'm going to get back to the slide you referenced. One of the reasons why we don't at all set a corporate mandate for pricing -- and there are some, we believe, companies that do. They say, \"You've got to get x percent on a renewal or you can't renew it.\" Well, what happens is you'll lose your best accounts because they don't need the x percent of rate. And in your least-profitable accounts, you get the x, and it needed twice x. And so while it looks initially like you've done good work, the fact is you've got underlying real adverse selection working against you. So first on the margin, when you're in an improving profitably dynamic, that point of rate versus the point of retention is just such an easy call. On the marginal dynamic, that's an easy one. And -- but importantly, the ability to execute and understand where one draws the line on that chart is just critical to the actual improvement in profitability. Otherwise, you're going to have a whole series of operating dynamics that are going to look great, but unfortunately, it's never really going to translate into improved profitability. So it's the combination of recognizing the trade-off between rate and retention, which again, on the margin, is an easy one, but executing it based upon the history of the account. I'd make one other point with respect to that chart because it's really an important one and it can get lost. This is the long-term loss ratio. So if we -- this is the actual experience of an account up to as much as 7 years, if we have the account that long, because we also understand the premise that an account can be terrific performing over 2, 3, 4, 5 years and then have an unusual loss, an unusual fire. And you certainly don't want to react dramatically to one insured loss. We're in the insurance business, we anticipate losses. So it's not -- we're not looking at a 12-month loss performance here because, again, that would give you a potentially very adverse effect as well. This -- analytics here enable us to look at the long-term profitability of an individual account.","Brian W. MacLean","I just want to emphasize. This is Brian again. One other thing I made in my comments generally, but I think it's really important to understand who we are and why we think we can perform the way we do in the industry. The exhibit that we've got is a very simplified view of how we actually manage this. So what we actually use in our operation doesn't just have 3 segments, it has at least 5 by each of our business. So we've got our business separated by quintiles and it's got the long-term combined loss ratio plus a bunch of other factors. So we're not just looking at the loss experience of the account. We're looking at a lot of other things. And we're looking at that by individual business, by industry, by geography. And believe me, when we see the numbers come out, we go, \"Okay, they look okay, they don't look okay, but let's really understand why.\" So your question, again, Jay said it is great, that keeping the best business for the right reasons and taking the right actions on the more challenged business is what we have to do. And at the end of the day, that's going to result in numbers. And if we did the right things, we're going to be happy with what the numbers are.","Jay S. Fishman","And I -- while I can't prove this to you because I'm giving you back the reflection of conversations with agents and brokers -- we tend to forget about them in these conversations. There's an agent or broker who represents every single account that we're dealing with here. And that agent or broker understands the market deeply, understands alternatives and choices and flexibility and in the end makes a recommendation to his client based upon the actions that we're taking. One of the reasons, and this just comes from conversation, that agents continue to be supportive of the strategy here is that it's not being applied as a \"one size fits all\" dynamic. When we sit down and have a conversation about an account, it becomes apparent why we're having that conversation. And we're not -- we talked earlier about never -- we're trying hard not to be disruptive to an agent's business or to our insurance business, and that means getting granular enough to understand that the pricing actions fit the individual account and account strategy that you have. And that's one of the reasons why agents can embrace it because they understand what we're doing and they understand the economics behind it.","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then the second question I just had on Slide 9, the new business number and the revenue roll-forward or the premium roll-forward of $423 million; retention, really good, keeping it stable. It seems like this number is a little more challenged. Does this speak to a more competitive market with lots of capacity for new business? And just how do you -- how does that intertwine with your view on expanding rates, going forward?","Jay S. Fishman","Is your question -- I'm sorry, just to clarify, is your question that the new business amount seems low to you?","Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes.","Jay S. Fishman","I think we would agree with that, actually. It's really very difficult to -- we remind folks all the time that the profitability of our business and its long-term value-creation is a lot more dependent on how we treat our renewal book than what happens in our new. And the last thing that we really want is for agents to be confused, to find that we're being thoughtful and disciplined in our renewal book but we're being aggressive from a pricing standpoint from new business. I -- and so we recognize, going into this, that it was entirely possible as we became somewhat more urgent about profitability improvement, that the new business levels could very well fall off. Now this is a summary of lots of areas. There are some areas where I think we've overdone it a little bit where I think we could -- I think we've been almost too conservative with respect to new business and we've got to dial up. It gets -- it's not an overall strategy. There are regions where we've got it just right when we look at the numbers and it's working terrifically. And there are others where we've gotten a little too conservative and you want to dial that back just the littlest bit. But I don't perceive it as a comment on the competitive market. I'm sure there's some truth to that, but I think the more substantive dynamic is the approach that we bring to our enthusiasm, our aggressiveness or our conservatism at the point of new business.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jay, looking at the overall x cat and x prior-year development combined ratio of 94.6%, it's meaningfully improved from any of the 4 quarters of 2011. And I just want to get your sense as to whether we should think of that as the right run rate, going forward?","Jay S. Benet","Jay, this is Jay Benet. I think it's -- what Jay and Brian were talking about is the earning end of rate increases that we've been getting over the past 12 months. And when you think about whatever estimates you're making for a loss cost trend, you have to look at the amortization effectively of these written rate increases. And you've essentially seen an upward sloping line of rate increases in that period of time. So just arithmetically, if nothing else changed, if the weather was exactly the same, if loss cost trends were exactly the same, you would just see the combined ratio move in a favorable way based upon that amortization. So we'll see that happens with all the things I just mentioned. But it's not that it's reached a steady state, it's reached a different state than it's been in.","Jay S. Fishman","And Jay, I would add that one of the things we're taking for granted here as we're responding is that you understand the impact not only of catastrophic weather, which you immediately pulled out, but small weather, such as we call it around here, has had a significant impact quarter-to-quarter and even has some seasonality to it. It's not just a property loss. We've seen -- traditionally, fourth quarter, there are more auto accidents. We can have a conversation about why that is. And even the fact when there wasn't bad weather in the fourth quarter, there still seems to be some seasonality, so it's not quite as smooth as we'd all like to think. It would sure make it easier for us to manage if it was, but there is some seasonality and movement up and down, so I'd resist the temptation to just say, that's the number and it gets better from here. I have no idea what the next 3 quarters will bring, but I'm sure we're going to be sitting in front of you with some quarter where small weather was either much better than we thought it was going to be or much worse than we thought it was going to be. And that's going to evidence itself in the numbers that quarter.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I see. And my follow-up question is, was there any seasonal influence on the pace of reserve releases in the first quarter? Is there a certain book of business that gets analyzed because that picked up as well versus any of the prior 4 quarters?","Jay S. Benet","No. Our reserving processes are very uniform quarter-to-quarter. So this is just getting really the fourth quarter data from last year, analyzing in conjunction with everything else we've known about the reserves and seeing some very favorable movements. As you know, when you're looking at reserve development, you're seeing trends, you have to always determine whether those trends are real or whether there's some anomaly that's taking place. So we do want to make sure that there's enough data that has manifested itself as being real before we make adjustments, but that's something that's going to happen on a quarter-to-quarter basis. There's really no magic about the fourth quarter versus any other quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just have actually one question about -- I know there was a case, a John Mansville (sic) [Johns Manville] case, that was talked about in the first quarter just in the media in an asbestos settlement there. Did that have any impact on the reserve development in the first quarter?","Jay S. Benet","This is Jay Benet. No, we had no change whatsoever in our asbestos reserves in the first quarter or our environmental reserves. Actually, you can see that in all the discussion associated with the litigation and asbestos information.","Jay S. Fishman","There's no provision. I'm sure we have paids.","Alan D. Schnitzer","Right.","Jay S. Benet","I\u2019m sorry. We had no provision. No incurreds. We did have paids...","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then you -- I assume having asked this before, is -- on the 2010 book, you had some latent frequency, some late-reported claims. And I just wanted to see if we can get an update in terms of, has the late-reported claim activity abated for the 2010 comp accident year? And is it too early to talk about whether or not any of that activity has manifested in the '11 accident year?","Brian W. MacLean","So this is Brian. And again, you're talking specifically about comp year. So no, I think that we've seen the frequency dynamic relative to that business level off, and so we did not see any further activity in the first quarter on the 2010 year and are not seeing a similar dynamic through 2011.","Jay S. Benet","There's no change of any magnitude of -- in workers\u2019 comp reserves for either 2010 or 2011.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just last one. It was on the Slide 14, you mentioned -- what is the retention? What has been that sort of trend of retention over time, if you can? And I realize there's a lot of information in that slide, but are you seeing an improved retention of the business you want or stable retention of the business you want as you've taken rate over the past several quarters relative to kind of the retention of the business that you would rather not have that's on the higher side of the loss ratio spectrum?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, this is Brian. I would say, directionally, from a retention perspective, this is pretty consistent what we would say. It's the strongest retentions to the left here, and this one obviously, the middle bar, is slightly higher. But very solid retentions, in the plus 80% and the weaker activity on the far right. So I think, directionally, it's going to be similar.","Jay S. Benet","Yes, what we do from time to time is we look in our management information system for things that we use to manage the business and share them with you. So this is a slide that is prepared for many of our businesses on a monthly basis that we have just compiled for you to see the granularity in which we actually manage it. But it's not something that's showing a different view than what we would previously have had, had we been putting this together for you.","Jay S. Fishman","The analytics are not new. The analytics have actually been around for a long time. This is -- particularly just given the rate environment and some of the focus that some of you have had on rate and retention, we thought it would be helpful for you to actually see it and understand how granular you need to be for the strategy to be successful.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann of JPMorgan.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, just on the Page 14 slide. The over-simplistic view of the world might be that you'd expect lower retentions as you go up in terms of the loss ratio bands, but when we look to 60% to 90%, it's a little bit higher than the less-than-60% band. I'm assuming a lot of that just has to do with mix, but would love a little color there.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, it's Brian. I wouldn't overly analyze the precision of the -- which bars are higher. It was meant to be pretty much a representation of something, as we've said over and over, that we actually manage on a much more granular basis. We also don't look at just the loss ratio and the loss performance, so it's -- you've got a lot of other things going on there. As Jay said, it's a long-term loss ratio, so...","Jay S. Fishman","I'd actually remind you, because this is I think a pretty good example. We have shared with you in previous quarters, this goes back perhaps a year, that when we bring on a block of new business, what that loss ratio performance looks like and largely through the implementation of our own loss management practice, we're sitting with a group of 750 professionals who are really dedicated to helping our middle-market customers lower their losses. So if we've come into a situation that's not been managed, that we've not had before, it's new and they are engaging with us in loss management practices so that we actually believe that we can help them lower their loss experience in a reasonably short period of time, that will have us have one view of the account versus another kind of account that simply doesn't do it. That's another example of an important variable that goes into what our thinking about price and return acceptability is. We're -- we -- the reason we give you a long-term loss ratio here, how we look at it, is because that's what we're trying to achieve: long-term loss ratio performance that creates real value for everyone, by the way, not just for us but also for the customer. So that's an example of a pretty good variable, an important variable that we consider as we go through the pricing analysis.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, that's fair. I just wanted to make sure I was thinking about it right in terms of -- to the point you just made, there might be business in there you think shifts to a better cohort in terms of loss ratio over time to the actions you think you could take. There could be business in there that is Homeowners in the state of Oklahoma, which probably is suffering from last year, but you're making changes to try to -- I just want to get around some of -- I'm just trying to make sure I'm thinking about some of those things correctly.","Jay S. Fishman","You are, although, I'll point out this is just commercial accounts you're looking at. [indiscernible] This is just commercial accounts. So Homeowners Oklahoma, not part of this, but your concept is right.","Brian W. MacLean","But your concept is right.","Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, okay. I could have said small business Alabama instead. Okay, no, that's fair. And then just on the dividend, I guess one of my questions I have is, if cycles have changed, and we've talked about this a little bit in the past, and we're now troughing out at higher levels of -- higher earnings return levels than we would have in the past, how do you change -- you just raised the dividend, but if I kind of look at the new dividend, it's only -- if 2011 accident year earnings with kind of a 3.5% cat load is the right way to think about kind of the earnings base, that would still only represent kind of a high-30s payout ratio, which when you think about historical trough payout ratios or peak payout ratios for all the trough earnings seems pretty low. So just curious how you -- how -- whether or not that impacts how you think about the dividend over time and potentially kind of what a dividend payout could look like.","Jay S. Fishman","First, I'll tell you that we analyze it here independent of any cycle dynamics. We just, as I -- we shared with you before, we're not big believers in the concept of some mythical cycle that carries everyone up and then carries everyone down. But the nice thing about our whole capital strategy is that our philosophy is to return it all, is to return all the excess capital, and it's really in a combination of share buybacks as well as dividends. And so we don't perseverate a lot about the payout ratio. We also recognize that you can have a 1 in 500 event tomorrow and then you could have another 1 in 500 event the following week, and suddenly our payout ratio would look real high. So we always stand ready to pay claims, have liquidity, be available to make the payments we need to make and yet have a philosophy of we're not keeping any capital here that we don't think we can use productively. And we could certainly have an interesting debate about whether dividends and share buybacks have preference. And I've talked to many shareholders and I would tell you that it's split about 50-50 as I talk to them. So it's not something that we spend a lot of time, really, dwelling on. As long as we have a competitive yield, an attractive yield for owning our stock and we're committed to returning the rest of the capital, we think we're in pretty good position.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg of Langen McAlenney.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","On the commercial auto reserve strengthening, you had strengthening last year for that line. It's continuing now. You mentioned frequency and severity. I'm wondering if, given how long this is persisting, whether or not it's become more of a severe -- severity issue on the margin for you guys.","Jay S. Benet","Yes, Larry, this is Jay Benet. The trends that we had been seeing, we factor into our loss specs. And what we saw in the first quarter, based upon the analysis of the fourth quarter results, was a higher level of frequency and a higher level of severity. In the physical damage area, we're just seeing higher costs associated with car repairs. And every time you get more data, you're trying to evaluate what the proper pick is. And in some respects, we're chasing it a little bit. The dollar magnitude is not very much. When you look at what we're seeing in commercial auto as part of the reserve development, it's like $50 million. So don't think -- on a pretax basis. Don't think of this as some very, very large item for us, but like everything else we're doing, we react quickly and decisively to the kind of information we see. And as Brian said, it does impact our pricing as we move forward.","Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney","Great, that's helpful. And then can you just give us a little color, if there's any to be had, on your lower advertising spend for your direct consumer? Clearly, the underwriting loss associated with debs [ph] also came down in the quarter. Has -- is   anything changing on the margin with the strategy there?","Jay S. Fishman","Larry, no. Our strategy remains the same, and I think this is worth just 1 minute or 2. It's -- we made this investment as a long-term investment, and I'd just start off by saying that none of us feel differently about how we believe our independent agents' personal lines business is going to act. We know the customers we have. We know their socioeconomic dynamics. We know their risk management needs. It's hard for us to believe that, that class of customer is ultimately one day going to really want to take it on himself without someone advocating for choice and alternatives, but we also recognize that we could be wrong. And so we're going to -- we began to underwrite this with 2 concepts. First, a defensive one, which was, if we were wrong about the longer term and we wanted to be positioned to be able to respond. And then offensively, we also saw the possibility. And we do see who the customer is who buys direct, that's one of the real learnings of this. We understand now with real clarity who it is who's buying, that to the extent that change continued could we create a model that would build a successful business around it? And we started with nothing. We started without the technology or people in seats or an understanding or a marketing program. And over all these periods, I can tell you the things that have gone just terrifically. We have a technology platform that's solid and reliable. We have developed a marketing approach that actually does generate response, importantly, things that we learn. We figured, once someone would begin a quote process, they'd finish it. And we learned in the early days, not so. That in our early days, lots of the customers would start and then drop off. That required changes in processes and people and the rest, and ultimately, we now have solved that problem. We're pretty good at getting people to respond. We're pretty good at getting responders to get to a quote. And the next step is to get the quotes converted to sales. And so now, we're talking about not only process but pricing and competitive positioning and how the product is sold and the advice that's given. And we're going to gear our advertising spend now to when there's something to be learned when we're making a change, implementing a process and we've got to see what happens, so we'll go out and we'll be more active and we'll drive activity and we'll be able -- we'll be able to see what comes back at us. If we -- the great risk in all this, and 20 years ago, this happened to us once before, we had a great marketing success but a financial failure. And we're going to guard very carefully not to have that happen. And before we begin to really step down, we're going to make sure that there's a real -- a high likelihood of success financially that we can make the requisite investments, start to do the spending that's necessary to drive more activity and ultimately convert it, not only to sales but to sales that are priced and underwritten that produce an appropriate return. And we're just not there yet. We're not at that level. But we have a talented group of people who are driving the effort. It gets the attention of the senior leadership here. It's 1 of the 2 most strategic initiatives that we have. It's not a backwater activity, it's front and center. I'm proud of what we're accomplishing, but we're not going to make the real bad misstep of being convinced that we're ready to go before we are. So it's just going to be cautious, and we're going to keep learning and we're going to keep going. But I wouldn't read anything into the timing of our spending other than what's tied to the underlying process changes from which we're trying to learn.","Doreen Spadorcia","Jay, could I add one thing? This is Doreen Spadorcia. And I just wanted to make one other comment. In addition to that, we will have a lumpy spend. It's not going to be a set amount of dollars that you'll see every month. For example, we're looking at local heavy-up in the next few quarters, so you may not even see us on national TV. But in particular states where we know we've got a broad product appetite and match, we'll be in those places. In addition, we are spending quite a bit of time on digital marketing. Again, things you might not see and the cost structure might be different but very targeted, again, to the kind of customer that we match with so, again to Jay's point, that we can push that conversion rate up. So you just won't see probably big national spends, but we are doing marketing. Thank you.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Gabriella Nawi for any closing remarks.","Gabriella Nawi","Very good. Thank you, Tina. Thank you for joining us all today.

Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","This morning, we reported first quarter operating income of $698 million, or $2.33 per share, and operating return on equity of 12.5%. Especially in light of a relatively high level of catastrophe losses in the quarter, our underwriting results across the board remain strong, as reflected in our combined ratio of 92.3%.","To put the weather in some context, our catastrophe losses were about $100 million, after tax, higher in the quarter than they were last year, and these are the highest first quarter cat losses we've had since 2010. The timing of catastrophes is, of course, unpredictable, but this level of weather volatility is certainly within our playbook. We're confident in our ability to model and manage our exposures and that we're pricing appropriately for the risk. In this case, it just so happens that, by design, we have a healthy market share in the Dallas\/Fort Worth Metroplex, where severe hailstorms were concentrated. Doreen will have more to say about the severity and about our claim analytics.","The real story this quarter is about our execution in the marketplace. And across all our businesses, we couldn't be more pleased. In our commercial businesses, we continued to be successful in our efforts to maximize retentions on our best-performing accounts and improved profitability on poor-performing business. Retentions in the quarter were again at very high levels by historical standards and renewal premium change was positive.","We believe these production results were right on target, given our view of product returns, but as we've explained before, we don't manage the business on an aggregate basis. We execute deliberately, account-by-account or class-by-class. And you can see this on Slide 13 of the webcast, which displays the distribution of rate changes for our Middle Market accounts in the first quarter. As you can see from the slide, most accounts received a single-digit rate increase and there were a number of accounts that had a rate increase of greater than 5% or even 10%. So even now with the headline pure rate change just slightly negative, we continue to achieve rate gains in excess of loss trend on our poorer-performing business.","The real takeaway from this slide is that the aggregate rate number is simply an average of thousands of individual account actions, and that success in this business is not about the aggregate rate number. It's about taking the right action on each account and generating an appropriate return over time.","Our execution in the quarter also benefited from a commercial lines pricing environment that, from our vantage point, continues to be remarkably stable. The outlook that we provided this morning in our 10-Q for our BII and BSI segments suggest more of the same: continued high levels of retention and broadly consistent underlying underwriting margins.","In terms of execution, we were just as successful in our Personal Insurance business, with strong retentions and higher PIF counts in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners. Importantly, Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our expectations on all fronts.","The successful execution across all our businesses resulted in consolidated net written premiums that were about 5% higher in the quarter than they were in the prior year. Both new business levels and historically high levels of retention, particularly in our Middle Market business, contributed significantly to the top-line growth. The quality and breadth of our products and services, our extraordinary talent in the field and the strength of the relationships that we have with our agent and broker partners put us in a great position to win. In addition to that, we believe that we benefited in the quarter, both in terms of new and renewal business, from the stability and consistency we provide in the marketplace compared to some of our competitors, who are experiencing varying degrees of disruption.","Turning to capital management, as a reflection of the confidence that we have in our business, today, our Board of Directors declared an approximately 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.67 per share, the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases, and bringing the compound annual growth rate of the dividend to almost 10% over that time. All-in-all, despite an active quarter from a catastrophe perspective, a great start to the year.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet.","Jay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Alan. I'll start by saying that we were pleased with our first quarter results, operating income of $698 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, despite their being lower than the prior year quarter.","As page 4 of the webcast indicates, the $129 million decrease in operating income from last year's first quarter did not come about due to lower underlying underwriting results. Our consolidated underlying combined ratio is 90% this quarter, 30 basis points better than the prior year quarter. Rather, the decrease in operating income, along with the decrease in operating ROE, resulted from two items: cat losses that were $101 million higher on an after-tax basis than those in the first quarter of 2015; and, as we anticipated in the Outlook section of our 2015 10-K, a $24 million after-tax reduction in fixed income net investment income that was driven by the continuing low interest rate environment.","Page 4 also provides an analysis as to how our reported results compared to analyst estimates. As best we can tell, analyst estimates for cat losses were significantly lower than what actually occurred, which more than accounts for the difference. Our net investment income was $439 million, after tax, this quarter, which was $39 million lower than the prior year quarter. In addition to the lower fixed income returns, non-fixed income NII was down $15 million after-tax, due to lower hedge fund returns that resulted from the more challenging capital market conditions in recent months.","Each of our business segments once again contributed to net favorable prior year reserve development which totaled $180 million on a pre-tax basis. In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $93 million resulted from better than expected loss experience in Workers' Comp excess coverages for accident years 2006 and prior; and General Liability, primarily for excess coverages for accident years 2011 and 2013; in Commercial Auto for accident years 2010 and prior; and in our European and Canadian operations.","In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $60 million resulted from better than expected loss experience in Surety for accident years 2012 through 2014. And in Personal Insurance, net favorable development of $27 million resulted from better than expected loss experience in Homeowners and Other for liability coverages for accident year 2014, and in Auto for accident year 2014.","On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years developed favorably, other than the 2015 accident year, which is currently showing $65 million of unfavorable development, due to a few large property losses that occurred late in 2015 and a decision we made to rebalance personal insurance reserves among various accident years. In addition, other than commercial multi-peril, all product lines either developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development this quarter. While CMP developed unfavorably by $35 million, there was offsetting favorable development in the Property product line, as middle market property losses that had been recorded in the Property line at year-end 2015 was subsequently determined to be CMP-related.","Operating cash flows of $850 million remain very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of over $1.7 billion. All of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.7 billion pre-tax, or $1.8 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $82.65 and adjusted book value per share of $76.63 increased 4% and 2%, respectively, from the beginning of the year.","We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $790 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $181 million and repurchased $609 million of our common shares this quarter, including $550 million under our publicly-announced share repurchase program, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, and $59 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Alan said, the board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.61 to $0.67 per share.","So with that, let me turn the mic over to Brian.","Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Jay. In Business and International Insurance, operating income was $476 million, with a combined ratio of 94.8%. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development, was 93.3%, up about 0.5 point compared to the first quarter of 2015, reflecting a typical level of quarterly fluctuations within both the loss and expense ratios. This result is in line with our expectations, and we continue to feel very good about our underlying results.","Net written premiums for the quarter were up 3% year-over-year, with Domestic Business Insurance premiums up about 5%, driven by the strong production results across all our businesses.","In Domestic Business Insurance, we remain pleased with the continued execution of our pricing strategy. Given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention and, accordingly, we're very pleased that retention is at a historical high of 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change came in at 2.2 points, while renewal rate change was down slightly in the quarter and about flat overall. New business increased to $575 million, reflecting strong results across all our businesses.","Turning to the individual businesses, beginning with Select, we achieved strong retention of 81%, and renewal premium change of nearly 7%. Rate change was down about a point versus the fourth quarter of 2015, driven in large part by recently filed rate changes in Workers' Compensation. We generated new business of $103 million, up slightly year-over-year.","In Middle Market, retention reached a historic high of 88%, with renewal premium change of a point, in line with the fourth quarter of 2015. Importantly, retention of our best-performing business was approximately 90%, while for our poorer-performing accounts, we achieved rate gains in excess of loss trend. New business of $321 million was up 8% year-over-year, due in large part to strong results in our Construction business.","In Other Business Insurance, retention of 82% was up both year-over-year and compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Renewal premium change of about a point was in line with recent quarters, while new business of $151 million was up 24% versus the prior year, driven by Inland Marine, Boiler and Transportation lines of business. So across Domestic Business Insurance, we achieved strong retention and saw an increased level of new business opportunities in the marketplace. As Alan mentioned, our agents and brokers view us as a stable market with industry-leading products and services, which we believe had a favorable impact on both retention and new business, particularly in this environment, where several significant competitors are experiencing some degree of disruption.","Turning to International, net written premiums for the first quarter were down about 10% year-over-year, primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums were down about 4%, driven by disciplined underwriting in the face of highly competitive market conditions in the property lines at Lloyds. Retention for the quarter was strong at 82%. Renewal premium change was slightly negative, but above recent quarters, and new business of $76 million was up more than 30% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our new strategic personal lines auto product in Canada. This product was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product. And while we're still in the early days of the rollout, we're encouraged by the response, as we continue to see a significant increase in new business volume.","In summary, in the segment, we achieved strong underlying underwriting and production results, a great start to 2016.","And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen.","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Bond & Specialty Insurance started 2016 with a strong first quarter. And we remain exceptionally pleased with the financial returns in this segment. For the quarter, operating income was $144 million, up from the first quarter of 2015, due primarily to a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. We've also improved underlying underwriting results.","The underlying combined ratio of 81.1% was almost two points better than the prior year, driven by two items: one, the favorable expense impact of certain customer-related intangible assets, which became fully amortized during second quarter of 2015; and second, lower loss levels in certain management liability businesses.","Underlying returns in this segment were once again very strong and remain well within our target level. Results like this do not happen by accident. Insights provided by our deep industry expertise and analytics, along with disciplined execution of long-term strategies, has positioned us to successfully navigate arising economic challenges, the most recent being the disruption in the coal and broader energy sectors.","As for top line, we generated higher net written premiums for the quarter as compared to 2015 in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses. The increased Surety production reflected higher contract bond activity from mid-sized construction accounts. Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remains strong at 87%. New business premium was up more than 20% from the first quarter of 2015, and renewal premium change was up from recent quarters, driven by the non-rate components of RPC, including slight increases in average policy duration and insured exposures.","These results reflect the execution of our strategy to retain our best accounts and write more business in our return adequate product segments. In sum, strong top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty and we continue to feel great about this segment's performance.","I'll now turn to Personal Insurance. Operating income for the quarter was $139 million, down $113 million from the prior year quarter due to $69 million in higher tax and $68 million in lower net favorable prior year reserve development. The segment's underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 86.1%, 1.4 points better than the 2015 quarter. This improvement was driven by a lower expense ratio, which was due, in large part, to higher premium volume.","We continue to be pleased with production results and underlying financial returns in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners & Other. Looking at Agency Auto, we once again generated strong top line results and the loss experience of Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to perform in line with expectations. The combined ratio of 95.2% for the quarter was five points higher than the prior year quarter, due primarily to higher tax and a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development.","The underlying combined ratio of 94% was up 1 point from last year, in line with our expectations for the quarter. As we've discussed before, the significant levels of new business we've added in the last couple of years will result in a higher calendar year loss ratio in the early years, and improve over time. Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced to our long-term target return and is maturing in line with our expectation. As for our overall view of loss trend, blended frequency of severity remains unchanged at around 3%.","Production results continue to be exceptional at Agency Auto, with net written premiums up 13% year-over-year, driven by higher new business premiums and strong retention. We continue to grow policies in force, which increased 55,000 during the quarter.","Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other, we generated a combined ratio of 90.4%, even including catastrophes of 16 points. While cats were higher this quarter, the underlying combined ratio of 76.2% improved more than three points from the prior year quarter, driven by favorable non-cat weather. As you all know, weather will be volatile from period-to-period.","As Alan mentioned, this quarter was particularly impacted by severe hailstorms in the Greater Dallas\/Fort Worth area. Slide 21 of the webcast is an extract from our Hail Dashboard, which many of you will recognize from our Investor Day. This view is CAT 21, the most substantial event in the quarter, and shows you how much of the area was impacted by two and even three-inch hail. This demonstrates our proprietary capability to get near real-time data about hail size and duration, as well as potentially impacted policies.","Using this information facilitates a more effective claim response and assists us in estimating losses. Using these tools, as well as our on-site work in the area, we identified this as a significant event early on and were somewhat surprised at how low the industry estimates were. As more information has become public, it would appear that industry estimates for this event will rise. Notwithstanding the weather volatility, we remain very pleased with the underlying financial returns we're generating in this business, as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies.","As for production in Agency Homeowners & Other, we continue to make good progress, in line with our expectations. New business premium was up more than 30% from the prior year quarter. Retention remains strong at 85%. And we added 26,000 policies during the quarter, so even with the significant cats during the quarter, a great start to the year for Personal Insurance.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. We're now ready to take Q&A, if I could ask you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, go ahead.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning. My first question on catastrophe in the quarter, the $380 million, almost a third of your sort of normalized annual budget of $1 billion, so does this surprise you? And there were talk about heightened activity in hailstorms. Does it have implication for your pricing as well as your market exposure?","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Kai, good morning. It's Alan. Let me start and I'll see if others want to fill in. As I said in my opening remarks, the timing of catastrophes are always surprising to us, but there's nothing about the level of losses in that storm that are particularly surprising. It's in our playbook and we do feel like our risk selection and pricing is spot on, so nothing about this event that causes us to rethink anything. And if it had been a couple of weeks later in the second quarter, where we typically expect more frequency of severe storms, we wouldn't really have thought anything about it, so timing off by maybe a couple of weeks but nothing about it that we find surprising.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. My follow-up question is on the BI pricing, looks like continue the downward trends. I just wonder what give you confidence to maintain the good level of core margin or underlying margin, given the downward pricing trend, as well as now you have a higher level of new business. How do you make sure the underwriting of this or will that increase your initial accident year loss pick?","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Kai, if you look at the gradual slope of that pricing trend, yes, pricing is going down, but it's very, very gradual and it's consistent with our product returns. And this is why we wanted to put in Slide 13 that really shows you the redistribution. We continue to look at the execution on a granular basis, and we're very comfortable with the way that we're pricing relative to the returns that we expect, that we're getting on these products.","Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah and, Kai, this is Brian MacLean. I'd just chime in on the new business front. First of all, I'd emphasize that we haven't changed any of our return thresholds or our target pricing. And if we're obsessing about one thing in the business today, it's the quality of the new business that we're taking in, and we remain very comfortable that it's in customer segments, products and industries that we really think we understand. So we feel very good about it.","Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Well, thank you so much.","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, great. Thanks. My first question, I think, is for Doreen. Just looking at margins, I guess, in Agency Auto, looked like the accident year loss ratio deteriorated by a little more than 1.5 points. And it sounded like you're still attributing that mostly to just the impact of new business. I'm just wondering if that's the type of margin drag we should expect for the remainder of the year from the pressure from new business, or if there's anything else, at least in the short-term, that maybe drove up that accident year loss ratio?","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Let me talk about that for a minute. It is really attributable, and I would say solely; obviously, there's always a few things bouncing around, but driven by the volume of new business. What we build in to our modeling curves is the maturity of the book of business. And so what you'll see over time is, each cohort will begin to produce what our long-term returns are. So it is due to the level of new business.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, understood. And then, I guess my follow-up then would just be for Jay Benet, on the investment income side. And it seems like a lot of the discussion's around lower investment yields, but something that stood out to us a little bit is that it looks like the average invested assets were down about a little more than 1% on the quarter. And it also looked like there was, in the 10-Q, an allusion to a $0.5 billion payment on the asbestos side that's coming in the second quarter.","So just trying to understand, when you think about that $25 million to $30 million quarterly drag, is that contemplating sort of a lower level of invested assets, or should we think about that as all just being driven by your view of lower reinvestment rates? Thanks.","Jay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, hi. This is Jay Benet. It is a combination of our view as to what the rate environment looks like, as well as what the average invested assets are and will be. As you'll recall, in the first quarter of last year, we had a large payment to finalize the direct actions settlement for asbestos. That brought the average down a little bit. And, as you rightly point out, we're expecting to make a final payment on the PPG settlement when other parties finalize some of the remaining issues, which we don't view as significant issues, in the second quarter. We expect to make that payment in the second quarter, so that will have an impact as well.","Something else that affects the average invested assets, some of our assets are denominated in foreign currency. So you do have some currency exchange taking place where, in effect, the assets are still the same, just the currency-adjusted value is a little lower. But those are the two primary things, the two asbestos payments, that bring it down.","Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, thanks so much.","Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Thank you. First question is on that new business growth in Business Insurance, hoping to just get a little bit more color on, if that's coming from sort of disruption? It seems like the growth relative to the pricing trend, or what is talked about in the industry, is a little bit upside down. I mean, it's a little surprising, the size of it, so I would appreciate any help you could give on what's, you think, is really causing that expansion.","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. It's Alan and, again, I'll start. We don't think there's anything different in the pricing, and there's certainly nothing different in the return thresholds that we're seeking that's driving that. At \u2013 both increased levels of retention and new business are contributing to it. I think that's an important point. And we really start with what I said in my opening remarks. We think it's the quality and breadth of our products and services, the talent we have in the field, the relationships we have with our producers. All of that always puts us in a great position to win.","And on top of that this quarter, as both Brian and I noted, there was some disruption in the marketplace. And given our stability out there, we do think we benefit from that. It's hard, probably impossible, for any of us to try to put a finer point on the allocation of dollars to one cause or another, but we do think all of those things coming together resulted in the higher new business levels.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. And then, I guess for Doreen, I saw earlier in the quarter, you guys had a press release out that you're offering a discount for connected homeowners policies. I'm just curious. Any update on kind of that, or any of the other initiatives using technology into personal lines, be it pricing, be it UBI, et cetera?","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Yeah, we're still a little new in the space. I'll tell you a couple of things that we have. You know we have IntelliDrive, where we do offer a discount. It's mileage based. We're actually looking further into that, based on the apps (31:19) that are available and perhaps moving beyond mileage. So that's obviously on the list. Second, we did roll out, in a couple of pilot states, for use for individuals when they're using their car for Uber. And what it really does is, it covers what's called the trolling period. Until there's a match, then the coverage is clear that there isn't any personal insurance coverage.","And then, this discount for connected homes and if you think about it, similar to what we would do for someone who has an alarm or something of that sort, but we do have both of our homes up at Claim U are connected homes. So we can study how the data comes in. We can study what that changes about the underwriting process and the claim process. And we're also a member of CNET, which has a very sophisticated connected home in Kentucky. And we're the only insurer on that CNET home board looking for all the applications in the connected space, so that's just a little of what we've got going on.","Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Appreciate all the answers. Thanks a lot, guys.","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Vinay Misquith from Sterne Agee. Please proceed.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Hi. Good morning. So the first question for Doreen, just wanted to follow up on the personal auto side. I believe you said frequency was up 3% this quarter for personal auto. Curious as to what it was last year, and have you seen any negative impact from the warmer weather so far in the northeast in the first quarter on your frequency?","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","I'm going to give you really detailed answer, but the first thing I want do is correct that we've seen frequency of 3%. We've seen a normalized trend of 3%, which includes 0.5 point for frequency and 2.5 for severity. And that's been something that we've basically had baked into our results for two to three years at this point. So let me just go back a little bit on frequency, because I know we've talked a lot about it. We talked a lot about it at AFA, (34:03) too.","We know that others have commented on frequency in the industry. Some have commented that they're seeing higher frequency. Some have not commented at all. So we don't feel like it's the thing that's just ripping through the industry. It's affecting very specific companies. And the most important thing for us is where you're starting from. What assumptions have you made? So we have not assumed flat frequency for a number of years. It's been a 0.5 point.","And we may have talked about this last quarter, so I apologize if it's repetitive, but in 2014, there were some observations that frequency was dropping. We analyzed that very, very carefully and really didn't think it was systemic or sustainable. And so at that point, while we recognized the financial impact of that lower frequency for 2014, we went into 2015 assuming that trend was going to go back to where it was, and it did. And so the 0.5 point remains unchanged. The trend remains unchanged, and it really goes back to where you start from.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. That's helpful. The second question is just a follow-up on the new business growth on the Business Insurance. And it seems that the growth was faster in Middle Market and Other Business Insurance, where pricing is maybe slightly weaker than the Select accounts. So was that just a coincidence or just curious as to what's happening between those segments. Thank you.","Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, so this is Brian. I think in Middle Market, in particular, we've been doing a lot of things with our process and our people to be really active in the marketplace. Our flow in new business opportunities there are up a bit. And so I think part of it is the activity we've had. I think it's also linked to, and, again, as Alan said, you can't draw perfect connections here, but there is disruption in the marketplace amongst some significant competitors. And I think our strong position with agents and brokers and the breadth of product that we have in capabilities have really helped us there. So I think we're very comfortable. As I also said, we're obsessing over the quality, so we're looking at all of those deals.","In the Other Business Insurance world, there is some specific opportunities. We've got a transportation company, Northland Insurance, that does the smaller end of the trucking business, so not the large fleets primarily. They've had some neat opportunities. There's been some opportunity in the Inland Marine and Boiler business, again, somewhat a result of some actions that other carriers have taken. So I think all of those things have added up to it. And I think, I guess the main point, it's not tied directly to pricing and price change opportunity.","Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please proceed.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. On the Business Insurance rate increase now turning negative, in the 10-Q, I saw in your outlook that for Business Insurance, the expectation is still a stable underlying combined ratio. Can you help me square those two factors?","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Jay. It's Alan. When we talk about underlying underwriting margin in the outlook, what we're really talking about are dollars, not the combined ratio. And you could look at that as opposite sides of a coin, but we, for instance, would consider volume in there as well. But we've got the outlook being broadly consistent, and obviously we think about that as a margin of something around the prior year period.","But in that outlook, earned margin is a little bit negative, and we've got an expectation for large losses improving and volume also improving, and those two things adding give us an outlook of broadly consistent.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I see. All right. And then my follow-up question is clearly you had elevated first quarter catastrophe losses; given all the destruction in Houston from the floods, if you can give us your perspective on that. Now, I know flooding isn't typically covered for things like homeowners, but it would impact comprehensive auto or maybe some commercial property insurance, if you could help us out there.","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Jay, we're not going to pre-announce second quarter results. I would say we're early in the quarter and we typically expect the typical spring storms in the second quarter. So again, from a human perspective, human side of the news is terrible, but there's nothing about this that strikes us as particularly unusual. There are bad second quarter storms.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. Thanks.","Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Doreen, just to follow-up then on Ryan's question on personal auto, so is it then fair then if it's a function of sort of new business versus the older book that's impacting the loss ratio, so is it fair to assume that as long as the Quantum book continues to grow that that drags sort of continue to run through calendar year results?","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Michael, I'm not sure I heard the question, but was it that as long as we're writing Quantum Auto 2.0, we see a drag?","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, I think the answer to Ryan's question was something like it's not the new business discount so much a part of it, but it's also because the Quantum book is growing faster than the older book, so there's some mix as well. And so I'm just trying to understand like we had about 180 basis points of drag in the first quarter. Is it fair to assume that as long as Quantum continues to outpace your legacy book in growth, that that drag will continue to roll forward?","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Well, Michael, in the outlook, what we said is that our combined ratio would slightly deteriorate. And so I think that's fair for 2016. So we did expect that that pressure would come, and a lot of it has to do with the volume of the business.","Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yes. This is Brian. And I'm trying to get at what I think you're getting at. I'd make the point, the Quantum 2.0 profitability targets and margins are not different from our core book of business.","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Right.","Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","It's the normal vintaging and aging of business. So if we continue to write significant levels of new business, that will have a comparable impact.","Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","And...","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Sorry, Mike, just to draw your attention it to; this is Gabby. Again, in the outlook, we do say the underlying underwriting margin and just to make fulsome, you've asked about the loss ratio, but, in fact, as we had talked about the Quantum product, it's the loss ratio and the expense ratio, given everything we had taken out. So if you look at the success of the product and what we're thinking about in terms of profitability, it all hangs together.","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Yeah. And look at the...","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","And to your point, the combined.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Great. And then just on the homeowners' side, just quickly, I saw the expense ratio tick down. It looks like that's sort of seasonally first quarter. But on the loss ratio side, is there anything that we should be thinking about in the underlying there or it looks like obviously you had cat activity, but was the non-cat weather element just lower in the quarter?","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Yeah. For the first quarter, it was favorable non-cat weather.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. And then last quickly, the tax...","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","That made it favorable.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","The tax rate in the quarter, maybe this is for Jay.","Jay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I think you're asking the question why is the effective tax rate lower this quarter than it had been in prior year quarter. And the effective tax rate is always going to be driven by the mix of tax exempt income and fully taxable income. So what you're seeing here is the taxable income, fully taxable income, as a proportion of the total getting a little less because of the cat activity primarily. The change in the non-fully taxable income, the tax exempt income, was pretty de minimis. So if you do the math on that, you'll see that's the effect on the effective tax rate.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning. Thanks for the call. Congratulations on the quarter. Is there a similar new business effect on the commercial lines side where the seasoning causes an increase in the accident year? And if we see a continued acceleration of new business in the commercial lines side, would we see a similar pattern that we're seeing on the personal lines side?","Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. In short, yes. There's a new business vintaging kind of concept, where if you've got disproportionately more new business, that would affect your performance on the current year stuff.","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Paul, it's Alan. That's one of the reasons we point out that when we look at the higher levels of premium, it's pretty much evenly distributed between retention and new business. So it's not all coming from...","Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah.","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","New business at higher loss ratios.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Understood. Is it more or less pronounced, in your opinion, than we see in the personal lines business?","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're looking at each other. It's hard to say. It's probably similar, maybe a little less.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then separately, I'd love to know a little bit more, from a product perspective, where we're seeing the disruptions from the competitive perspective?","Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","I mentioned some of them. In the construction space, there has been action by other underwriters in the larger account size on the casualty side. There's been some action in the loss responsive businesses. But I think it's also broadly across middle market, and this is where, as Alan said, you can't triangulate to precisely what the numbers are. I think that we have a very strong position with distribution. We've got quality products, and we're viewed as a very stable market. So I think the broad market conditions, even beyond specific products, have been helpful, maybe uniquely to us there. (46:15)","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Paul, we definitely saw it in those lines of business where we know some of our competitors were taking some actions, but we also saw retention just up generally across middle market. And so, when we look at the flow we're seeing and the businesses that we're seeing it in, it's pretty broadly based.","Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good sign. Thank you very much.","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Following up on the Business Insurance underlying margin, is it fair to say that it's stable this year mostly because there was higher non-cat weather in 2015, but then, as you look out going forward, it would probably deteriorate because prices are below loss cost inflation? Is that a fair assumption, or am I off?","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Sarah, it wasn't so much weather in Business Insurance as it was a higher volume of large losses in the last three quarters of last year.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And one of the reasons that we give outlook for three or four quarters is because it's just, our perspective beyond that gets unreliable, so I don't know. But what I would point you to is the way we've been able to manage returns across all three business segments over a long period of time throughout a bunch of different conditions. And so, you look at what Doreen and Greg and Michael have done in Personal Insurance by taking some difficult actions and repositioning that business and rolling out a new product; you look at what Tom Kunkel did in Bond & Specialty in a bunch of credit-sensitive businesses through a very difficult period in a financial crisis; think about what we've done in Business Insurance going back to 2010, when you look at the \u2013 we went back then, we looked at the outlook for returns and realized that we had to do some things differently.","So your perspective that it might fall off beyond where we're giving guidance for suggests purely current course and speed. And I would say that we're current course and speed now because we like product returns, and when we get to a point in time where we don't like product returns, then we'll do different things. So I wouldn't necessarily draw the conclusion you were drawing. But I don't know for sure.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're all speculating beyond three or four quarters.","Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","One of the other things that makes it very challenging is, we do talk about loss trend, and the loss trend is off of a starting point, and sometimes we adjust the starting point. You've heard us talk about base year movement. That comes about when we see favorable development and try to evaluate, well, what does that mean for the very loss picks that we had, that were the starting point for the loss trends that go forward. So it is, as Alan said, a pretty complicated set of variables that go into it, and the ability to look out much beyond three quarters or four quarters is a bit challenging.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. And then just on, in Auto Insurance, the top line growth there was very strong. Could you just elaborate on what was driving that? And is that a level that we should view as sustainable?","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Well, what we've talked about, Sarah, is that the percentages probably won't be the same, because our base is growing. And, as you probably recall, Quantum 2.0 rolled out over a couple of years, and even including three more states this year, California, North Carolina and Massachusetts. And so, we think that the percentage will moderate, but we're not anticipating that the product would be less competitive.","We also are pleased to see, and so were our agents, that they're actually getting a disproportionate share of their new business from captives in the direct marketplace, which is something that we talked to them about.","So, I would say the percentage, we definitely don't think will stay the same, but probably from a count perspective, we expect it to continue to perform at similar levels.","Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you for the answers.","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Uh huh.","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please proceed.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, thanks. A couple of just quick questions here, first, Doreen, I think you spoke at AFA (50:54) a little bit about increasing limits on homeowners. I'm just curious, kind of initial success you're having with that. How are agents responding?","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Brian, let me just make sure that I reset, because what we talked about at AFA (51:14) was we had pilots underway with 10 agents in a couple of states and we took all of those suggestions: some, few coverage; a lot of process changes; and some guidance on pricing. And all of that work is getting done now.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","So we're anticipating later in the year, beginning of 2017, that that would be broadly available. So all the work's being done, but it's not yet broadly in the marketplace.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Is that going to require an increase in just your overhead expense, i.e. different types of claims adjusters as you get into that higher limit stuff; different types of underwriting, product, that kind of stuff?","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","No, Brian. What we did as part of this assessment was looked at whether our current infrastructure, our current claim handling and our current product, could support that. We'll need to make a few tweaks to that, but we're not building this super high-end home capability. This is really the mass affluent and we think we have a really good match with our current capabilities in that marketplace.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And just a quick one for Jay; Jay, it looks like your pension expense down, earned benefits (52:39) down about $17 million on a year-over-year basis. Is that something we should expect kind of going forward? And where does that hit in your P&L?","Jay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Well, in terms of the P&L, it's in a couple of places because pension expense, of course, relates to head count. And head count ends up in G&A as well as ULAE. So it's in more than one spot. But as it relates to, you know, what's taking place in the pension area, you may recall in the 10-K, we provided a disclosure saying that we were adopting a new methodology that went into the estimation of pension, and that dealt with using a yield curve approach rather than a spot rate for looking at the interest and service costs to coincide with how the PBO was being calculated. And that did have a benefit, and that'll be a benefit that carries on into the future.","Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please proceed.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I think this is for Doreen. When you have a quarter like this where catastrophes are a little bit higher, does that actually affect the G&A expense? I'm asking specifically homeowners, because that was down sequentially.","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Yeah, I didn't hear it.","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it was about G&A expense?","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Yeah. No, not...","Jay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","No. Yeah, I think the answer is no, it doesn't really. There's obviously some claim expense that could be impacted, but...","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Right.","Jay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer","But in that case, nothing unusual this past quarter.","Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance","Yeah. And the only thing down the road I would say about G&A is if we have a very, very profitable year in home, that's where we would add contingent commission, and so we'd be really happy if that went up because it was a great year.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. And then more broadly speaking, I think you've mentioned the disruption in the marketplace a few times. Is there enough disruption out there to make it worthwhile to look at sort of building out the skill set into more specialty lines?","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, there's nothing about the current level of disruption that's causing us to look at that, in the sense that we look at that all the time. We're always looking for opportunities to expand our product set and to drive our competitive advantages and capabilities into new lines of business, new products. So we certainly don't wait for a moment in time to do that.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. And this will be our last question, please.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America. Please proceed.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I guess question on the retention in Business Insurance; is it fair to say that this retention would have been at the upper end of what you might have expected given market conditions?","Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Jay, this is Brian. Yeah. I mean, the 88% retention in Middle Market was very, very strong, and clearly would be at the upper end. We dissect where we're getting the retention. We feel great that it's about 90% in our best business. But it's our experience in the business would be that those are very tough levels to sustain.","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So given that, Brian, then did you guys ever think, gee, we could push a bit more on pricing, maybe let that retention settle in at a still phenomenal 84%, 85%? I know it's a tough balancing act, but is that part of your thought process?","Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","So every single day in the marketplace, with every transaction, that's what our underwriters are doing. They're working with agents and brokers in the Middle Market and in the Other Business Insurance stuff account-by-account, and they're trying to determine what's the appropriate thing to do for that account. You can get caught up in the arithmetic of what you just said. And we do ourselves at times, but it's not as straight a line to say, well, if you reduce retention two points and you raise prices X, that's not exactly how the marketplace dynamics work.","But we are always trying to look at the retention rate trade-off and looking at that in the context, first and foremost, of the return that we believe we're generating on that account or that book of business and is it appropriate and where do we want to go.","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","So we're balancing it all the time.","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would take you back to the conversation about account-by-account execution.","Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. The graph that Alan referenced in his opening comments and...","Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Well, thank you for the answer.","Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Great.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 22, 2019.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.","Abbe Goldstein","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers discussion of our third quarter 2019 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.","Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three Segment Presidents, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take your questions.","Before I turn the call over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of our webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance.","Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.","Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning we reported third quarter net income of $396 million or $1.50 per diluted share. Our core income was $378 million or $1.43 per diluted share. Our results this quarter were impacted by net unfavorable prior year reserve development and business insurance. Continued favorable development in the workers comp lines was more than offset by a strengthening of asbestos-related reserves and reserves in GL and commercial auto lines.","As I shared at an Industry Conference last month, GL and Commercial Auto were impacted against quarter by a tort environment that is deteriorated beyond our elevated expectations. As I'll explain in a minute, we remain confident that this is an industry wide issue and that we're responding appropriately to recently emerging data.","Underwriting income in the quarter benefited from record high net earned premium of $7.2 billion, driven by higher pricing and strong retention over the last four quarters. Also contributing was a continued execution of our strategy to invest in the capabilities, we believe are required for success given the forces of change we've previously identified as impacting our industry.","In addition to investments in talent, technology and workflow, this includes progress in terms of our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency. As reflected in our sub thirty expense ratio for both the quarter and year-to-date. As you've heard us say, improved operating leverage gives us a flexibility to invest further in our strategic priorities but the benefit from the bottom line and or be more competitive on pricing, without compromising our return objectives.","In terms of the underlying underwriting margin, as you can see on page 4 of our earnings presentation, the underlying combined ratio was solid at 94.1% but up 1.1 points over the prior year quarter. Favorable items impacting the underlying results included improvement in our workers comp loss ratio and as I mentioned continued excellent work, including operating leverage. More than offsetting those items were higher noncatastrophe weather-related losses and headwinds from more challenging tort environment.","Dan will provide more detail on the pieces, but I'll spend a minute on the tort environment. The aggregate impact of the adjustments we have made this quarter to reflect our latest view of the tort environment together with those in the second quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year, added about two-thirds of a point to the underlying combined ratio on a year-to-date basis.","To give you some perspective on the loss environment, on page 21 of the earnings presentation, we have included the chart of ISO data showing a measure of commercial auto bodily injury severity for the industry over the past four years. The full year 2018 data just recently became available.","As you can see, during 2018, the observed average paid claim cost shifted significantly, compared to the prior years as well as throughout the year. This view of industry data for other commercial liability coverages is not yet available for 2018, but we believe that the more aggressive tort environment is to one degree or another impacting those as well. While the chart reflects industry data is not Travelers specific, the shaded area of the graph illustrates the challenge we've been addressing as part of our current and prior year reserve in process over the past four quarters, developing a stable view of ultimate losses in this case is made difficult by the magnitude of the shift in the data combined with the fact that, it is so recent, the long-term nature of the exposure and a lengthening of the claim development pattern, which is difficult to assess as it emerges.","At the heart of the issue is a higher and more aggressive level of attorney involvement on claims. Taking a step back, we will manage through this, but the bigger issue for all of us is that the broken tort system imposes the tort tax across society.","According to a recent study by the Institute for Legal Reform, tort costs amount to approximately 2.3% of U.S. GDP or more than $3200 to your US household, and considerably more than that in some states. There's also evidence that some claimants can be disadvantaged. According to a study by the Insurance Research Council private passenger claimants with attorneys received less on average and settlement from insurers after deducting legal and other related costs as compared to claimants without attorneys. On average, it also takes claimants with attorneys longer to receive payments. Tort reform has been a public policy focus for us and we're stepping up our efforts. ","Turning to the top line, our production results were again excellent in the quarter. We grew net written premiums by 7% to $7.6 billion, a record increase of more than $500 million with each of our business segments contributing. Our premium growth reflects high levels of retention and improving annual premium change broadly across the portfolio as well as a higher level of new business. We're growing our business with confidence in terms of accounts, geographies, and industries that we know well. ","In business insurance, net written premiums increased 7%, as we achieved renewal premium change to 7.4%, including renewal rate change of 4.3%. In both cases, the highest levels in more than five years. At the same time, we maintain strong retention and grew new business. As you'll hear from Greg new business in our national property business benefited from a level of disruption in the market, as we picked up some accounts on our terms. New business in middle market benefited from success with our business center strategy which you've heard us discuss, and across the board, new business levels benefited from stronger new business pricing. ","Environment specialty insurance, net written premiums increased by 13% with strong production across our management liability and surety businesses, including historically high domestic management liability retention with improving renewal premium change in record new business. In personal insurance net written premiums increased by 7%, with agency auto up 3% and agency homeowners up 11% both benefiting from strong productions. Given the headwinds that the industry is facing for continued low interest rates, a challenging level of social inflation, and ongoing uncertainty surrounding weather related losses will continue to seek higher prices and improve terms and conditions. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Tom and Michael about our segment results. ","To sum it up, we feel terrific that the strategy you laid out in 2017 is contributing to top line success in each of our segments. In terms of the bottom line, you would have hoped that the tort environment would not have deteriorated further. So in a business or from time to time loss costs are going to vary from our expectations. As we've explained what's important is recognizing it quickly and taking action. We have a long track record of successfully managing our diversified businesses through challenging circumstances, with insights from leading data and analytics driving our executions, the best talent in the industry and deep relationships with our agents and brokers, who continue to leverage the power of our franchise to deliver industry leading results over time. ","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan. ","Dan Frey","Thank you, Alan. Core income for the third quarter was $378 million down $309 million from the prior year quarter, and core ROE was 6.5%, down from 12%. Both measures reflect the elevated levels of general liability and commercial auto losses that Alan described, which impacted both prior year reserve development and the current action here, as well as an elevated level of non-cat weather losses. ","Our third quarter results include $241 million of pre tax cat losses, compared to $264 million in the prior year quarter. Prior year reserve development, which I will discuss further in a few minutes, added 4.1 points to the combined ratio, compared to favorable 0.2 points in last year's third quarter. The consolidated underlying combined ratio of 94.1%, which excludes the impacts of cats in PYD, increased by 1.1 points, driven by elevated general liability, commercial auto and non-cat weather losses, partially offset by favorable experience in workers compensation.","The adjustments we made this quarter to reflect our latest view of the tort environment added about half a point to the underlying combined ratio, including a catch-up related to the first and second quarters. In terms of weather, noncatastrophe weather-related losses added about two-thirds of a point to the quarter-over-quarter change in the consolidated underlying combined ratio. For context, total weather losses in the aggregate, cat and non-cat, were somewhat worse in the quarter than what we planned for but year-to-date, total weather losses were well within the range of what we would consider normal.","The third quarter expense ratio of 29.5% was in line with recent periods and brings the year-to-date expense ratio to 29.8%, reflecting the terrific progress we've made in recent years. Both the third quarter and year-to-date expense ratios are about 2 points below where they were at this point in 2016.","Our third quarter pretax underlying underwriting gain of $386 million declined by 14% as the elevated losses in GL, Commercial Auto and non-cat weather were partially offset by the benefits of higher levels of earned premium and favorable experience in the worker's compensation line.","After-tax net investment income decreased by $19 million from the prior year quarter to $528 million. After-tax fixed income NII increased by $17 million as expected and our non-fixed income NII was strong was below last year's results. Fixed income NII benefited from an increase in average invested assets, resulting from continued growth in net written premiums and slightly higher yields, compared to a year ago. We expect after-tax fixed income NII in the fourth quarter to be about flat, when compared to the fourth quarter 2018 as a benefit from higher levels of invested assets will be largely offset by lower reinvestment rates.","As we look ahead to 2020, we currently expect quarterly after-tax fixed income NII to be about $10 million to $15 million lower than our results for each of the first three quarters of 2019, as the impact of lower interest rates is expected to more than offset the benefit from higher levels of invested assets. Net un-favorable prior year reserve development was $294 million pretax, compared to $14 million of net favorable PYD in the prior year quarter. Bond and specialty insurance had net favorable PYD of $3 million. In personal insurance, favorable PYD of $19 million resulted from improvements in both domestic property and auto.","Business insurance experienced net un-favorable PYD of $316 million pretax, including the $220 million increase to asbestos reserves, $134 million strengthening to general liability reserves and $114 million strengthening to commercial auto reserves, driven by similar factors to those we experienced in the second quarter.","You may also notice that, we have a small charge for environmental this quarter. As a number of claims and related reserves have decreased over time, we've now moved to a quarterly evaluation rather than the annual evaluation we have historically completed during the second quarter. These reserve developments were partially offset by favorability in the worker's compensation and property lines. The asbestos reserves strengthening resulted from the completion of our annual asbestos review during the third quarter. As has been the case in recent years while there was some slight improvement in several of our asbestos indicators, including a decrease in deaths from mesothelioma as a percentage of the population over time, our expectation had been for more of an improvement. This phenomenon has continued to drive periodic reserve strengthening for us and for others in the industry. ","As we've discussed before, we added a new catastrophe reinsurance treaty for 2019 providing coverage for PCS designated events for which we incur $5 million or more in losses above an aggregate retention of $1.3 billion. Through September 30th, we've accumulated $1.2 billion towards the $1.3 billion retention should we reach $1.3 billion, 86% of the next $500 million of qualifying losses will be covered by the treaty. Remember that the purposes of the treaty, hurricane and earthquake events have a cap of $250 million per occurrence. ","Let me take a minute to address the topic of our subrogation claims against PG&E for the California wildfires of 2017 and 2018. On September 22nd, PG&E and the ad hoc subrogation group of which Travelers as a member agreed to a proposed $11 billion settlement for subrogation claims against PG&E. Because of the uncertainties that remain regarding our ultimate realization of subrogation benefits from PG&E, we have not reflected any benefits in our financials as of September 30th. As PG&E ultimately emerges from bankruptcy pursuant to a plan of reorganization which includes the proposed settlement, we estimate the Travelers would recover between $400 million and $450 million pre tax which is net of expenses and net of amounts that would inure to the benefit of our reinsurance. ","Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $2 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. Recent decreases in interest rates have increased our net realized unrealized investment gains. As of September 30th, we had a net unrealized investment gain of $2.4 billion after tax. ","Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses is now $90.9 3% higher than at the beginning of the year. Consistent with our historical capital management strategy, our first objective for the capital we generate from earnings is to invest it back into the business where we think we can do so at attractive returns. Beyond that will continue to return excess capital for shareholders. Accordingly, this quarter, we returned nearly $600 million to our shareholders comprising share repurchases of $375 million and dividends of $215 million. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned $1.8 billion of capital through dividends and share repurchases. ","As we grow premium volumes with all else being equal, we will need to retain more capital. So to the extent we continue to grow, we would expect that over time, the amount of capital return to shareholders relative to earnings will be somewhat less than it otherwise would have been. ","And with that, I'll turn the microphone over to Greg. ","Greg Toczydlowski","Thanks Dan. Insurance produced segment income of $179 million and the combined ratio of 107% both impacted by net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $316 million pre tax as Dan mentioned. The underlying combined ratio of 95.9% was a half a point higher than the prior year quarter.","There are several moving pieces underneath that variant, so we've included information on slide 9 of the earnings presentation to break down the components of the change. I'll start with the notable items that increased the underlying combined ratio year-over-year. The first three year items that we discussed with you previously with the first of those being the half point impact from the lower earned premium due to the net new cat treaty. The remaining two items related actions we took last quarter and in the fourth quarter of last year related to the challenging trends in the tort environment. The last of the un-favorable items related to adjustments to our loss estimates resulting from an even further deterioration in the tort environment as Alan and Dan have discussed.","The impact of these latest adjustments was about a point, with about a third of that relating to the current quarter and the remaining two-thirds of that being the re-estimation of the first and second quarters of the year. Similar to last quarter, this quarter's adjustment included both commercial auto and general liability. I'll note that unlike Commercial Auto, where returns are clearly inadequate, the returns in the general liability line or primary-end access are much healthier for us. ","Turning to the favorable year-over-year items, first one is point of favorability relating to adjusting our workers' compensation losses, about half of that impact relates to re-estimating the first two quarters of 2019. Second, our expense ratio benefited by about half a point due to the continued successful execution of our strategy to improve productivity and efficiency. Importantly, we continue to achieve this expense leverage, while investing in strategic initiatives that position us for the future.","In addition to these individual favorable items, there was about half a point of favorable impact from other items that cause normal variability from period-to-period.","Before turning to the top-line, I'll make a comment on weather-related losses. While non-cat weather losses in the quarter were elevated relative to our expectation, was not highlighted in the quarter-over-quarter underlying combined ratio comparison, as they were similarly elevated in the prior year quarter.","Catastrophes for the quarter were below the long-term average in business insurance and so all-in weather losses for the segment were favorable to what we would consider a normal level. As for the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were up 7% over the prior year driven by strong underlying production results with renewal premium change being the biggest driver. In terms of domestic production, we continued to execute on our strategy to improve the margins in the book while retaining our high-quality portfolio.","We achieved strong renewal premium change of 7.4% in the quarter, including renewal rate change of 4.3%. The renewal rate change was up seven-tenth of a point from the second quarter and more than two and half points from the third quarter of last year, demonstrating continued momentum in our execution even after the continued downward pressure in workers' comp pricing. The higher rate levels are being achieved broadly across the book with about three quarters of our middle-market accounts getting positive rate increases this quarter, which is up from about two-thirds in the third quarter of last year. Also, while the commercial auto and property lines continued to lead the way, our general liability both primary and excess as well as commercial multiplayer line also saw meaningful increases.","Importantly, at the same time as we achieved these price increases, we maintained strong retention. New business of $568 million was up 21% from the prior year quarter, driven by strong result in our national property business which I'll touch on in a moment, as well as higher new business pricing and deliberate execution across the other markets. As for the individual businesses in select renewal premium change and renewal rate change both picked up from the second quarter year-over-year, while retention remains strong at 82%. New business was up 5% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strategic investments in product development and ease of doing business. To that end, we're excited to launch the completely redesigned small business owners' policy product in three states during the quarter that includes industry leading segmentation in a fast easy quoting experience. The full rollout of this product will take some time but we're encouraged with early returns. ","In middle market renewal premium change was 6.3% with renewal rate change of 3.8% up more than two points from the third quarter of last year, while retention remained high at 86%. New business premiums of $308 million were up 15% from the prior year quarter driven by higher new business pricing, as well as success in writing larger accounts during the quarter, while impacts from large accounts will be lumpy from time to time we're pleased to see the results of this quarter as further evidence that the business center strategy that we've discussed with you is paying off by freeing up our local underwriters to spend more time on larger accounts. ","Finally, I'll touch on our national property business, which has had two consecutive quarters with substantial year-over-year increases in new business. As I mentioned last quarter, in this space, we are seeing more opportunities given the level of disruption in the marketplace and we're selectively writing attractive accounts at our prices and on our terms and conditions. Case in point for the new accounts of size that we wrote in the second and third quarters, we've previously written and quoted 80% of them and let them go when we couldn't write them at prices and on terms and conditions that met our disciplined standards. ","To close while we're managing through a changing environment and we couldn't be more pleased with our insight and execution. As Alan said, given the low interest rate environment, continued uncertainty around weather related losses and an upward pressure from the tort environment will continue to see great and use all other available levers to meet our return objectives. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. ","Tom Kunkel ","Thanks, Greg. Bond and specialty delivered another quarter of strong returns and growth. Segment income was $139 million, a decrease of $57 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to a lower level of net favorable prior year reserved development and to a lesser extent, modestly higher management liability loss estimates for the current year. The underlying combined ratio increased 5.3 points from the prior year quarter. ","As you can see on Slide 14, about 3 points of that is a third quarter adjustment for management liability coverages, about two points of which reflects a re-estimation of losses from the first two quarters of 2019. Despite the increase the combined and underlying combined ratios remain strong at 83.3% and 83.6%, respectively. ","Net written premiums for the quarter were up 13% with strong growth across all businesses. In domestic management liability, we are pleased that retention remained at a historically high 90% with a renewal premium change higher at 4.8%. New business for the quarter was a record $67 million. Domestic surety growth reflected higher bond bonded contract sizes and our international growth was primarily in our UK management liability businesses, including from new product offerings. Our production results reflect the profitability of our high-quality portfolio, strong field execution and our strategic long-term investments in our suite of products and services, together with our commitment to thoughtful and disciplined underwriting and risk selection.","As reflected in our improving renewal premium change, we are pursuing price increases for coverages, where we are experiencing elevated levels of loss activity and we will continue to do so. So bond and specialty remained strong, results remained strong and we feel terrific about our ability to continue to deliver excellent results over time.","And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.","Michael Klein","Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. In personal insurance this quarter, we're pleased with our continued execution in the marketplace as we grew premium and policies in force in both our agency automobile and homeowners and other product lines, continued to achieve excellent profitability in agency automobile and reported good results in agency homeowners and other, particularly considering a high level of noncatastrophe weather-related losses.","The combined ratio for the quarter was 98%, slightly higher than the prior year quarter of 97.2%. For the segment catastrophes and net favorable prior year reserve development were comparable to the prior year quarter, while the underlying combined ratio was higher by 1.1 points, primarily driven by higher noncatastrophe weather-related losses and the impact from the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty partially offset by lower other loss activity. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 7% with strong retention, renewal premium change and new business. ","Agency automobile delivered another strong quarterly performance with the combined ratio of 93%. This is our seventh consecutive quarterly combined ratio under 96%. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter of 92.7% was comparable to the prior year quarter and consistent with an excellent year-to-date result of 92.8%, two points lower than the prior year.","In agency homeowners and other, the third quarter combined ratio of 100.2%, increased 1.7 points from the prior quarter, driven primarily by a higher underlying combined ratio, partially offset by lower catastrophe losses and a favorable change in prior year reserve development.","The underlying combined ratio for the quarter of 93.5% was five points higher than the prior year quarter, as approximately four points of higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and 1.5 point impact from the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty were partially offset by lower other loss activity. The higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses this quarter are on top of an elevated level in the prior year quarter and are reflective of an increased number of events compared to historical experience. As a point of reference, data from NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, reflects approximately 8,500 severe weather events in the U.S. for the third quarter of 2019, that's a 28% increase when compared to the average third quarter for the period 2013 to 2018.","As we've mentioned in the past, we've increased our loss expectations to reflect higher levels of loss activity and property and that's reflected in the pricing gains we're achieving and our plans to further improve pricing and property going forward.","Before I shift to discussing production, I'll remind you that, looking ahead to the fourth quarter, there tends to be a good amount of seasonality in our combined ratio results. On a relative basis, fourth quarter losses are typically higher than the full year average for automobile and lower for homeowners and other. ","Shifting to quarterly production agency automobile premiums were 3% with modest growth and new business and policies enforce, while retention remains strong at 84% and renewal premium change was 3.6. We remain focused on actions to grow our auto business at returns that are continued to meet our objectives, and are encouraged by the increase in policies enforced this quarter. Agency homeowners and others delivered another strong production quarter with retention of 86% even as renewal premium change rose to 6.9% up more than three points from the prior quarter. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter where renewal premium change is higher than the corresponding prior year quarter. ","Consistent with our objectives, new business for agency homeowners and other was up over the prior quarter with increases in both issue policies and average new business premiums, largely driven by our ongoing successful rollout of Quantum Home 2.0. We remain pleased with the quality of the new business we're writing. The profile of the business is consistent with our expectations and most of the increase in issued policies results from higher quote volume at a consistent quote rate. As we intended sales and marketing activities associated with the rollout of Quantum Home 2.0 along with this granular pricing segmentation, customizable coverages and ease of quoting are leading contributors to higher new business volumes. ","Wrapping up while profitability for the quarter was down slightly from the third quarter of 2018 we're pleased with our year-to-date results. Segment income of $497 million and the combined ratio of 96.2% are both significantly improved relative to the prior year. Given our pricing actions and property and early signs of policy growth in auto, we remain confident in our ability to generate profitable growth going forward. The competitive advantage of a balanced and diversified portfolio and our focus on being a complete property and casualty solution for our agents and customers continues to position us well in the marketplace. ","Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe. ","Abbe Goldstein","Thank you very much and now we're ready to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jay Gelb ","I want to touch base on the liability claims inflation issue across GL, commercial auto and DNO, I realize that this topic was discussed and especially warned about it at the Barclays conference last month and what I'm trying to get a perspective on is whether the company can say we have the all clear on reserve issues going forward are the sole risk of more and more reserve strengthened going forward given there has been an issue in three of the past four quarters?","Alan Schnitzer","I don't think that we or any company could ever give that kind of assurance, we take our best people our best processes, we look at the data that we have, and we come up with our best estimate every quarter. When we look back over the last four quarters of decisions that we've made, and the estimates that that we published, we look at it and say gee based on the information we had at the time, we think we made the right call, we weren't too aggressive in any of our assumptions, we in fact picked close to the top end of the range and in many of those cases and again this quarter we looked at the data and we think we've done the right thing. So and that's one of the reasons why we wanted to provide Slide 21. You can see this is an industrywide phenomenon and you can see the extent of the shift at least from an industry perspective. This isn't in our data, but it's illustrative and relevant in thinking about our data, it's quite a significant shift. And in one of the associated factors is just lengthening of the claim development pattern and that's a difficult thing to assess as it emerges.","And so, with every quarter, we get a new data point, with every new data point, we get a different trend line and we put our best estimate behind it and we continue to think running the business by the numbers, being very disciplined about that is the right way to do it. So, the answer is, we have got a long track record of managing that way over time. We think we're running it the right way and we think we have got the right estimate now, but I don't think we or anybody could give you a guarantee.","Jay Gelb ","Right. Although. That's what you're saying, you are as confident as you can be that this issue is addressed, right.","Alan Schnitzer ","I'm just confident as I can be that is our best estimate.","Jay Gelb ","Right. Okay. And then, separate topic with regard to capital return I believe there was commentary in the prepared remarks around potentially less capital being returned as a percentage of earnings as the company's growth rate continues to accelerate.","Would you be able to give us some parameters around that? I mean, historically, it's been right around 100% of earnings and return annually in the form dividends and share buybacks. Would that number be something closer to 75% or should we think about another number?","Dan Frey","Jay, I don't think, it's Dan. I don't think, we would target a number and I don't think you should think about it as a target per say. That's going to be an outcome of the things that we always talk about, which is, how much capital do we have? How much capital do we think we need to adequately support the business that we're writing and that we expect to add on a go forward basis? What are all the investments we make in the business that we think can generate an adequate return and then we look at what's left and return it.","The comment was intended to raise awareness, as you say, from this point forward, as we continue to grow premium to support a business that's got a bigger premium base you're going to need a bigger capital base. And if you perpetually return to 100% of earnings your capital base wouldn't change. So, it's simply to give an indication that, as we continue to grow, if all of those remained equal, you should expect something lower than it otherwise wouldn't have been. But, we're actually not going to target a particular percentage of earnings that we're looking to return.","Alan Schnitzer ","And Jay, I'll just add two things to that. One is, no change at all in our thought process or growth toward capital management. This is in ordinary course just a function of what we have been able achieve in terms of growing premium base. And two, one of the reasons why we can't give you a number is it's going to depend on what lines we're growing in and what the geography is and it's just not linear math behind it.","So, we couldn't actually give you that target.","Jay Gelb ","I appreciate that. Thanks very much.","Alan Schnitzer ","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Good morning. My first question you know goes to your outlook for business insurance. Broadly, really unchanged and you guys are looking for margin improvement which given the commentary in the queue seems to be a function of price exceeding trend and some improvement in your international business. So, what I'm trying to get a sense of is, you know, what is the forward view on you guys have for price and then also for trend, can you give us a sense and I know it's a compilation of all your different businesses where trends sits today and then the outlook for that as we think about improvement coming into your margin from here in the Business Insurance segment? ","Greg Toczydlowski ","Elyse, in terms of the outlook for price, you see the price that we've written and that's going to earn in. And we give you an outlook for RPC. And so, it's those two components that are going to earn in over time. In terms of loss trend, we always talk about that in BI from a segment perspective and we shared last quarter that we had increased our view of loss trend to 4.5%, and that's obviously on top of the current PIKs which have been adjusted throughout the course of the year. So, it really is the math from those pieces. ","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. So, trend was 4.5% last quarter. So, it's somewhere within the vicinity of 5% right now? ","Greg Toczydlowski","No, no. The 4.5% was up a half a point from what we had historically talked about at 4%. Also, Elyse, I'll caution you that the 4.5% is our long-term outlook on loss trend. And so, in any given period, there's going to be some volatility in actual losses. But that's sort of the math and the way we think about it over time. ","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then, my second question, within Business Insurance, you guys released reserves within workers' comp. You also lowered your loss PIKs there this quarter. I guess I'm just trying to get a little bit more color. Given the weaker pricing in comp combined with the higher loss trend you're now seeing in other businesses within that segment, what gave you guys, like, the conviction to change your PIKs there? And then, if you could also let us know the prior-year development on comp in the quarter. Thank you. ","Dan Frey","Elyse, it's Dan. So, I'll start. Thematically, what gives us the conviction to move on workers' comp is, as we see results come in, again, there's a long-term assumption around what's going to happen to the cost to settle workers' comp claims. A lot of that's driven by medical cost inflation. And we see in our data and there has been discussion in the industry that medical cost inflation has continued to be pretty benign relative to our expectation. So, that drives the prior-year release as another period of data comes by where, again, the cost of loss settlement comes in favorable to what our expectation was. In this quarter, in round numbers, order of magnitude is around $100 million pre-tax, a little less than that. That flows through into what we're seeing in the current period as well. Obviously, in the current period, you're reacting to both what are you seeing in terms of the number of claims coming in and those settlement trends. So, workers' comp has been a pretty steady level of good news relative to our expectations and that's why we adjusted both numbers. ","Alan Schnitzer","Elyse, I'd just add. It's just ordinary course. We treated workers' comp this period like we treated it every other period. And we didn't actually make a change to either our frequency trend or severity trend. It's the impact of adjustments to prior-year reserve that's rolling through the current year. ","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Mike Zaremski ","Hey, good morning. First question is on the catastrophe reinsurance treaty because I have a feeling it's going to trip us up in our models. So, I believe you said it's up to $1.2 billion. So, it's very close to the $1.3 billion retention. And you've reported $800 million of catastrophes, which is a separate definition. So, if we trip the $1.3 billion, which it seems likely from a profitability standpoint, does that start benefiting the underlying loss ratio in both the commercial and homeowner segments? Or just if you can help us think about that. ","Dan Frey","Mike, it's Dan again. I think as we discussed the treaty from when we first talked about it going back to the first quarter, it will depend on what weather actually comes in over the remainder of the year. If we have a treaty benefit, how the treaty benefit will be allocated back between what we would call major cats versus minor cats. So, if all the losses that come in from this point forward are major cat and that's what causes us to trip the treaty, and then those are the recoveries, most of the benefit would be attributable to major cats. If on the other hand, most of the weather that comes in is $10 million to $15 million PCS events that don't meet our major cat threshold, that's where the money will go. So, it really is too early to tell and it will depend on what actual weather we experience in the fourth quarter. ","Mike Zaremski","So, it could benefit the underlying loss ratio as well. ","Dan Frey","That's correct. ","Mike Zaremski","And lastly, so if I think about the past two to three years and what sticks out, top line growth, clearly, has improved for the company, but it's also coincided during a period of time of increasing non-cat weather losses. You guys have said catastrophe levels are -- you had changed your view on that being a little higher and you now are seeing kind of higher liability loss trends in the last year or so. So, is this all telling us that top line growth and maybe retention rates need to maybe fall a little in the coming year and take a step off the gas a little bit? ","Alan Schnitzer","No. Mike, I don't think that's the way we think about it at all. We don't ring a bell and say grow or ring a bell and say don't grow. We execute one account, one class of business at a time, and we do that with a return focus. And so, we're out there executing on our accounts, trying to retain the ones we want, on the prices and terms and conditions that we want. And we're out there hustling our new business that we find attractive and that meets our return objectives. And when the sum of those things adds up to growth, we'll grow. And when it doesn't, we won't. So, there's nothing about the growth that's contributed to the loss environment and we are pretty good about reflecting the loss environment into our pricing models. And so, the answer is, I don't think so. The other thing I would say is the growth that we've seen is -- and I don't want to diminish the strategic efforts that's led to new business. I think that's important and it's been successful. But a very big component of the growth that we've reported has come from a very strong foundation of retention and price on top of that. So, that's important to keep in mind as well. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. ","Larry Greenberg","Good morning and thank you. So, on commercial auto, I'm just trying to compare what you're experiencing with the issues that you had a while back in personal auto. And I think then, you talked about taking a higher loss PIK or adjusting your loss PIK for severity. But then, the actual trend really hadn't changed in your view. So, if I'm hearing correctly, in this situation, we're talking about higher kind of loss PIK foundations and then an accelerating trend on top of that, is that fair? ","Alan Schnitzer","We've definitely increased the base year. And we also, last quarter, as we told you, increased the loss trend from there. So, we have increased both in commercial auto. Is that responsive, Larry? I'm trying to make sure... ","Larry Greenberg","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, that's great. And then -- and I think Greg talked about pricing and terms and conditions. Can you talk about how terms and conditions might be changing in response to what's going on? ","GregToczydlowski ","Sure, Larry. Good morning. This is Greg. Yes, most of the terms and conditions activity are happening in the national property space, and that certainly is leaking down into property across middle market. And I think our underwriters start with the first thing, is they look at the total insured value, making sure that we've got the right values on the properties. From there, we'll get into discussions with both distribution and the customer around co-insurance, and that includes both deductibles and sublimits. You can think of sublimits on both flood and earthquake, but those are some of the items that are in the marketplace right now and our underwriters are very involved in pulling those levers. ","Larry Greenberg","Yeah. I was thinking more in terms of commercial auto. ","Alan Schnitzer","Larry, in response to that, given the environmental nature of that, most of the PIK for that is going to come from price. To some lesser degree, it will come from some risk selection, and that's a factor as well. And then, we'll calibrate our litigation strategy and those would be primarily the three levers we use to address it. ","Larry Greenberg","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. ","Paul Newsome","Good morning. Thanks for the call. I was hoping we could revisit sort of the view in commercial insurance between -- the relationship between pricing and retention. I guess I'm a little surprised at the strength of the retention given you are raising prices. And I'm just wondering if that means that you're not stepping on the pricing as hard as you could or if there's some other dynamic going on there. ","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah. Paul, again, we're executing one account at a time. And so, we're making the right decisions on price and retention, we think. I think one takeaway that we take from the retention is that there is certainly more room to go. The market is not pushing back on us, which I think is evidence that these really are environmental issues. So, we think the execution is terrific and we think there's more room to go. I think, also, in terms of our customers and our distribution relationships, doing this thoughtfully, slowly , steadily, I think there's a lot of benefit to that. And so, that's part of our execution strategy. ","GregToczydlowski","Paul, one thing I would add -- this is Greg -- is those are both headline numbers, both the rate and the retention. Our underwriters are equipped with very granular segmentation, and so we spend more time watching the mix distribution of some of the distressed accounts and the healthy accounts than we do in the aggregate numbers. We're pleased with that execution when we look at that segmentation. ","Paul Newsome ","And, separately, I was wondering, as we look at the expense ratio, if there is any impact this quarter from change in contingent commissions that would affect, either this quarter or maybe even next year, the level of the expense ratio. ","Dan Frey","Paul, it's Dan. I'd say, across the place, generally not. It's been pretty consistent. And contingent commission is a relatively small component of the overall commission mix to begin with. ","Paul Newsome","Great, thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. ","David Motemaden","Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on the changes that were made in general liability. Are you still -- are the changes really still commercial auto related excess or has it spread to other parts of GL? And if you could talk a bit about the changes you made to each portion of that. ","Alan Schnitzer","David, it continues to be both. Again, I think the right way to look at this is, broadly, over the last year, as we've been addressing this issue, and if you look at it in that context, commercial auto and the excess GL where the underlying event is auto related continues to be the majority of it. But GL has been a not insignificant factor. And, in fact, in this quarter was a bigger factor than commercial auto.","David Motemaden","Got it, okay. And just in terms of just putting numbers around it, a peer had come out and said they were seeing severity on the GL side up in the high-single digits. Just wondering, is that sort of what you guys are seeing and is that what you guys are assuming now going forward in your loss PIKs? ","Alan Schnitzer","We've just never given the severity at that granular level, and I don't think we're inclined to do that. We stop at the segment level where we've given you the 4.5%. And I also think there can be some confusion when we're talking quickly about loss trend because, ultimately, we're trying to get to a loss PIK and there's two things that contribute to that. One is base year changes and two is a change in loss trend. And as I said earlier, over the course of this year, as it relates to liability lines, we've raised both the initial loss PIK, which we refer to as base year and the loss trend. So, those are both up.","David Motemaden","Got it, okay. And just a follow-up. The slide in the back, that would imply that what you guys are seeing is more severity related, but are you also seeing just a spike in frequency from higher attorney involvement as well? ","Alan Schnitzer","No, it's definitely more of a severity issue than a frequency issue. ","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. ","Josh Shanker","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my call. So, I wonder if there's any way of getting to a little more granularity on the tort issues. As you've acknowledged you're experiencing and you do look at your competitors numbers and they're not. Is there something going on in the account size that's different between large, middle market and small account on the tort severity side that might make Travelers book look different than some others? ","Alan Schnitzer","Josh, I don't -- my instinct is no, and that's one of the reasons we shared the industry data, is we don't that -- we believe this is environmental. We don't think there's anything about our book of business that makes us more susceptible to these types of claims. And you turn on the TV, you see attorney advertising. The rate of attorney involvement and the aggressive behavior is up and I think that's going to impact anybody writing liability coverages. So, we don't think there's any reason to think that our book of business is more susceptible than anybody else. ","Josh Shanker","And then, do you have anything you can add to the granularity where you're seeing the biggest tort severity issues from your own experience? ","Alan Schnitzer","Josh, it's broadly across geographies, business and accounts. I guess, if you're -- again, it's always hard to generalize broadly in a sentence or two because this is a complex issue. We've spent hundreds of hours on this internally. So, it's always difficult to try to summarize in a sentence or two. Broadly speaking, it's probably groups have homogeneous type claims where a potential plaintiff can be reached by television commercial. And so, whether that's commercial auto accidents or slips and falls or things like that, once you get into the bigger stuff, you tend to have cases that are and always have been associated with claimants being represented and aggressive litigation, but, again, that's -- it's a very high level summary of a complex issue. ","Josh Shanker","And then, Elyse kind of asked it, but I just wanted to -- the workers' comp reserve release for the intra-year reserve, is third quarter typically a quarter where you do a comprehensive workers' comp reserve analysis? Should we expect typically that, in the third quarter, we could see resets of PIKs typically? ","Dan Frey","Josh, it's Dan. Not really. The comp is something that we have enough data and enough information that's in the regular flow that we're assessing work comp reserve levels every quarter, and I've commented on work comp in PYD in earlier quarters this year. ","Josh Shanker","Okay. Thank you for the answers. ","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. ","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. Just a couple of quick ones here. First one, if I kind of strip out some of the noise in the quarter on Business Insurance, it looks like the underlying loss ratio kind of improved, call it, by 40 to 50 basis points. Is that a kind of fair representation of what an earned rate right now is coming through in excess of trend? ","Alan Schnitzer","That's a business insurance question? ","Brian Meredith","Yeah, Business Insurance. Sorry, yeah. Just making all of the adjustments that you put in the slide, it looks like it's about 40 to 50 basis points of improvement on a year-over-year basis. ","Alan Schnitzer","Brian, we're looking at the math. Yeah, I don't think it's quite so easy to look at it that way. You're getting to a very narrow view of rate versus loss trend. And I understand why that's so appealing to look at. But the fact is, there's a lot of things that go into margin. And whether it's mix or reinsurance or claims handling or risks, there's all sorts of things that go into that. And so, really hard to look at rate versus loss trend and think you've captured it. ","Brian Meredith","Got you. And then, just one other quick one here. As I look at your outlook for RPC for the Business Insurance here over the next 12 months, what is your assumption with respect to exposure in that figure? Do you expect it to kind of moderate here, be the same? ","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah. We just don't break that out. There's a lot of estimation that goes into that number. And we have a view on the pieces, but to imply that we've got that level of granularity out a year, that would be a false impression. ","Brian Meredith","Great, thanks. ","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley, your line is open. ","Michael Phillips","Thank you. And thanks for the time here. I guess I'll take the pressure off on Business Insurance, guys. Switch over to personal, and specifically personal auto. Your outlook says for margins that are relatively in line with last year. So, I guess, could you talk about what you're seeing there in pricing and loss trends? We're certainly hearing loss trend is on the rise in some segments from competitors. So, kind of want to see what you're thinking there and why we'd expect it to be flat next year? ","Michael Klein","Sure, Michael. This is Michael Klein. I would say, we see the same industry data you referring to and certainly are keeping an eye on severity trends both in physical damage and in bodily injury. As we've talked about this year, we've tended to see frequency going the other way and offsetting some of those severity increases. Our view of loss trend heading into the outlook is fairly consistent with the trends we've been seeing. The outlook includes an assumption that pricing will continue to moderate in auto, and that's consistent with our strategy to continue to work to return to growing policies in force. So, the broadly consistent outlook has a little bit less earned price in it than we've been running and, again, a consistent view of loss trend. And then, lastly, I would just remind you that for sort of rolling four quarters we do expect a higher combined ratio in the fourth quarter than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018, partly driven by normal seasonality and driven by the fact that we had an unusually good quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as some prior-quarter good guide catch-up in that quarter. So, it's a tough comparison, fourth quarter to fourth quarter. ","Michael Phillips","Okay, great. No, thank you for that detail. And then, I guess, second question on Bond & Specialty. What are you seeing in the management liability and kind of maybe some more granular details of kind of what's driving that increase there. ","Tom Kunkel","Sure. Thanks for the question, Michael. So, if you look back at where we started reserving at the beginning of 2019, there were definitely some elements of normal loss trend versus rate that impacted how we were reserving there. But when you look at that third quarter re-estimation we did, that was largely driven by an increase in frequency, having to do with things like #MeToo, sexual harassment and, to a lesser degree, securities class action suits. So, that's really what we've seen driving any movement that we've had in management liability there. By the way, I should point out that where we're having elevated loss trending, we're definitely pursuing price in the marketplace. I think you can see that with publicly traded companies and you can see it in various other parts of the marketplace that are impacted by the scenarios I discussed. ","Michael Phillips","Okay, great. Thank you very much for the color there. ","Tom Kunkel","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. ","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. Just had a couple of quick technical ones and then a broader one for Alan. But, first of all, just trying to size this, within multi-peril, what percentage of the claims dollars are usually for liability type of stuff versus property? ","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah, I don't know that we have that at our fingertips or that we've vetted that number, Ryan. ","Ryan Tunis","Got you. And then -- that's fine. The other one I had was just -- it seems like part of this is auto claims and excess umbrella, those type of things. Is there a -- can we get a sense for maybe like what percentage of overall casualty claims outside of workers' comp or something like that can be tied back to something auto related? Is there some way that you think about that? Just trying to think about the auto exposure outside of what you explicitly call commercial auto. ","Alan Schnitzer","Yes. We definitely don't have that breakout at our fingertips here, Ryan. We can look for that and try to figure out whether we can share that outside of this call, but we definitely don't have that in a vetted way that I think we'd be comfortable sharing. ","Ryan Tunis","Okay. No, that's fair enough. And then, again, Alan, I guess this is sort of a broad one. But, yeah, this is, I guess, the third quarter of the last four where we've had, I guess, an increase in the loss PIKs. What would you point us to this quarter that would give us more confidence that that's unlikely to happen going forward? Like, what are you looking at that gives you more confidence, that should give us more confidence? ","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah. Ryan, I think it was the first question of the call. I wish I could stand up and guarantee that we've got it and this will never happen again. Obviously, I can't do that. I don't think anyone can do it. And I'd point to the magnitude of the shift, which is very recent information, and the long tail line. The lengthening of the claim development pattern really does complicate our ability to assess it. So, it's a complicated process. And it's taken us a couple of quarters to get to where we are. We're going to get another quarter's worth of data in a couple of months here and we'll see where that comes in. There is an incremental level of confidence that comes from the fact that we've now got a couple of quarters strung together and a view on what a new trend line might be. So, that gives us a little bit more comfort. But I can't tell you now where the next dot was going to come in on the chart or what that's going to do to the trend line. It's data we haven't seen yet. I can tell you that we now have four quarters of data and a new trend line. We've certainly reacted to that and we're confident that we're taking the right swing at it. But I don't know what I could tell you beyond that. ","Ryan Tunis","But you'd say that the '19 PIKs are now relatively reflective of some of the more seasoned accident years at this point? ","Alan Schnitzer","Yes. For sure it would be more reflective of the more seasoned accident years. You've got the '17 and '18 accident years, which I -- I think the '17 accident year is, on commercial auto, less than 50% paid. And so, the GL would be even less than that and the '18 accident year would be less than that on both. So, we've got a couple of recent and accident years that are still developing. But the older accident years, yes, as they season, we certainly feel much better about those. And as I said, we now have four quarters where we've -- it's not just another data point. It's another line. And we've reflected that in a way that we feel is very responsible in terms of coming up with our best estimate. But I can't and nobody could tell you what the next data point is going to look like. ","Ryan Tunis","Okay, thanks. I'll leave it there. ","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you. ","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Sean Reitenbach with KBW. Your line is open. ","Sean Reitenbach","Hello. For PG&E, would any benefit from there come through operating income? ","Dan Frey","Yeah. Ryan, it's Dan. It would. It would come through the same way we would record any prior-year reserve development. So, it will be in core income. It won't affect the underlying combined ratio because it relates to prior accident years. ","Sean Reitenbach","Okay. And although it's still very strong, the retention rate slipped by a point in 3Q. Would you expect any further kind of -- that to tick down any further as a result of either any kind of non-renewing any business that you've had trouble with or pushing for more rate and losing lose anything there? ","Dan Frey","I would say the retention rates remains very, very strong by historical standards, particularly an environment where we're getting rate at the level that we're getting it. So, we feel terrific about the retention. We don't project where that's going. So, I don't have a comment on that. But I will say that we like our book of business and our objective would be to keep a lot of it. ","Sean Reitenbach","Thank you very much. ","Dan Frey","Thank you. ","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I now turn the call back to Ms. Abbe Goldstein. ","Abbe Goldstein","Thank you very much for joining us this morning. And as always, if there is any follow-up, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Thanks. And have a good day.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.","And now, Alan Schnitzer.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you, Gabi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to finish 2015 with another strong quarter. As I'm sure you've seen, we reported operating income of $886 million or $2.90 per share and operating return on equity of 15.8%.","That caps off another terrific year with operating income of just over $3.4 billion, operating income per diluted share of a record high $10.87 and operating return on equity of 15.2%.","Our underwriting results across the board remains strong as you can see from our combined ratio of 86.6% for the quarter and 88.3% for the year.","In domestic business insurance consistent with our marketplace objectives, we achieved a record level of retention in the quarter with positive renewal rate change. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, we generated an all time best underlying combined ratio of 80.1% for the year. Broadly speaking, the market dynamics in the commercial insurance marketplace continued to be remarkably stable.","In personal lines, Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our expectations. In agency auto, we had year-over-year policy in force growth of 8% in the fourth quarter, and as you can see in the webcast that's the sixth consecutive sequential quarter of increasing discount. Those of you who have been following our agency auto know what a success it has been.","We are also pleased to be seeing an impact from the success of Quantum Auto 2.0 in our homeowners business, and you'll hear more about that from Doreen.","Jay Benet will have more to say about our current investment results, but I\u2019ll just note that we have delivered pretty exceptional returns on equity for quite some time notwithstanding over the headwinds in the investment arena. Historically, low interest rates, the decline in energy prices, and volatility in the equity markets just is examples from this quarter.","This speaks volumes about our ability to select in price underwriting risk and the strength of our insurance franchises. Just as a data point, our after-tax net investment income is about $1 billion lower in 2015 as compared to its high in 2007.","On the other hand, our after-tax underlying underwriting margin is about $1 billion higher in 2015, than it was at its low in 2011. Particularly to the extent the fixed income yields remain low and that seems like the outlook for at least some time. And with capital finding its way into the largest end of this business, expertise and generating underwriting returns and having strong franchises in the smaller middle marketplaces with meaningful barriers to entry will really matter.","Turning to capital management, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned nearly $1.2 billion of capital to our shareholders in the quarter and nearly $4 billion during the year. For long time consistent strength of our results since behind our capital management strategy.","Just as we have for nearly a decade, we will continue to right size capital and invest profitably in the business. Things to that strategy we have now returned close to $35 billion of capital to shareholders since the middle of 2006 when we started our share repurchase program.","Let me take just a minute to comment on the leadership transition. What I suspect many of you want to hear from me is where do go from here? As I've explained to our leadership team, our challenge is this, to take today's summit and make it tomorrow's base camp.","I'm confident that we already have the right strategy in place to do that and we've got the right team to execute it. We've been executing it. We understand it and it has been remarkably successful. It's this team's strategy.","Delivering superior returns overtime will continue to be our North Star. We'll do that by investing in and leveraging our competitive advantages, delivering industry-leading products and services, and making sure this is a great place to work for the best talent in this industry.","That's not to say that we won't challenge ourselves constantly to make sure that both the strategy and the way we are executing on it remains relevant. It's critical that we reassess all the time and we will continue to be a leader in evolving and innovating, particularly given the potential for change around this. Among other things, we'll continue to refine our data and analytics to make sure that we lead in reselection and pricing.","We'll continue to innovate on the product side and our claim in risk control organizations to make sure that we're delivering at the forefront for agents, brokers and customers. And we'll continue to build on our leading position with our distribution partners to make sure that we're partner of choice for them. We've always understood the value of size and scale and we're well-positioned in that regard.","Just as in the past, we'll seek opportunities to grow thoughtfully and in ways that contribute to shareholder value. And as always, we'll manage our expenses thoughtfully. All of that is business as usual for us. Our confidence in our strategy and our track record in executing on it give us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver for our shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet.","Jay Benet","Thanks Alan. As Alan mentioned, we're very pleased with our results this quarter; net income per diluted share of $2.83, operating income per diluted share $2.90 and an operating ROE of 15.8%.","These results were driven by the continuation of our very strong current accident year underwriting performance as evidenced by an underlying combined ratio of 90.7% despite relatively high non-cat weather related losses in the quarter.","Net favorable prior year reserve development was very strong at $292 million pretax and cat losses were relatively modest at $46 million pretax. That said, as shown on Page 4 of the webcast, current quarter results were lower than our very strong fourth quarter of 2014 results, mostly due to the impact of low interest rates and private equity returns on net investment income and in even higher amount of net favorable prior year reserve development in the prior year quarter.","Underlying underwriting margins were pretty much the same in both quarters. Fixed income NII of $422 million after-tax was down $31 million from the prior year quarter, principally due to what we have been saying for many years.","Securities has had higher book yields have gone off during the past 12 months and have been replaced with securities having lower yields due to the current low interest rate environment.","Another contributing factor to lower fixed income NII was the modest reduction in average investments that resulted in part from the company's $579 million first quarter 2015 payment to settle the Asbestos Direct Action Litigation.","Looking forward based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect to the impact of lower reinvestment yields and a lower level of fixed maturity investments could in 2016 result in approximately $20 million to $25 million of lower after-tax NII on a quarterly basis when compared to the corresponding periods of 2015.","Non-fixed income NII of $25 million after tax was down $42 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower private equity returns. Private equities essential broke even this quarter as compared to earning $30 million after tax in the prior year quarter due to lower valuations for energy-related investments.","Each of our business segments continue to benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development and business in international insurance, net favorable development of $176 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in workers comp for accident years 2006 and prior and accident year 2014. In general, liability for both primary and excess coverage\u2019s for accident years 2012 and prior and then the company's operations in Canada.","In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $80 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience and fidelity ensured date, for rest of the years 2012 through 2014. And in personal insurance, net favorable development of $36 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in auto liability for accident years 2013 and 14 and in homeowners and other liability for accident year 2014.","As I have done in the past, I'd also like to provide you with some insight into what our combined 2015 scheduled peak is expected to share when it's filed on May 01. On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years in the aggregate across all product lines are expected to develop favorably and all that one product line on scheduled peak are expected to develop either favorably or show very modest or de minimis unfavorable development.","The product line that is expected to develop unfavorably by approximately $50 million free tax is products liability occurrence but another product line other liability occurrence will have an offsetting amount of favorable development as we've refined our allocation of IBNR between these two components of general liability based upon how losses, such as those related to construction defect have been developing by coverage type.","In total, our general liabilities were not - general liability reserves were not affected by this action. Returning to GAAP for the year we had net favorable development of $941 million pretax with approximately $840 million coming from our U.S. ops and a little over $100 million coming from our Canadian and U.K. operations.","There are two additional topics I'd like to update you on. As shown on Page 21 on the webcast, we renewed our corporate cat aggregate XOL Treaty effective January 1. The treaty provides coverage for both single cat events and an accumulation of losses from multiple cat events with similar terms as in the prior year, but at a lower cost. The treaty continues to provide $1.5 billion of coverage, part of $2 billion excess of $3 billion after a $100 million deductible per occurrence.","It keeps the same broad parallel and geographic coverage in the same positioning of the coverage layer providing a significant buffer between earnings and capital. The treaty has a single limit with no reinstatement provisions. And please note that the total cost of this treaty and therefore the reduction and cost are quite small in relation to our operating income.","The second topic relates to the recent drop in oil prices. Page 22 of the webcast contains updated information showing the magnitude of our investments in below investment-grade energy bonds and energy-related equities. And you can see that some of these investments is relatively small and the exposure is quite manageable.","Operating cash flows remain strong, $760 million in the fourth quarter after making a $100 million discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan bringing total operating cash flows to over $3.4 billion for the year.","We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategies as you heard from Alan. We returned to almost $1.2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $183 million and common share repurchases of a little over $1 billion.","For the full year, we returned almost $4 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $744 million and common share repurchases of over $3.2 billion.","Holding company liquidly ended the year at $1.6 billion, well above our target level and our debt-to-total capital ratio, which was 23% at the beginning of the quarter slightly elevated due to our having issued $400 million of debt in the third quarter to prefund $400 million of debt that was maturing in the fourth quarter, has come back down to 22.1% well within its target range with the retirement of that debt.","Net unrealized investment gains were almost $2 billion pretax or $1.3 billion after tax, which was down from $3 billion and $2 billion respectively at the beginning of the year due to an increase in interest rates and spreads.","Book value per share of $79.75 grew 3% from the beginning of the year and importantly adjusted book value per share of $75.39, which eliminates the after tax impact of net unrealized investment gains grew by 6% this year.","So with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.","Brian MacLean","Thanks Jay. Business in international insurance results for both the fourth quarter and the full year was strong. We continue to generate excellent returns with a full year combined ratio of 92.1% and our retention throughout the year was very strong and reached a record level this quarter in our domestic business.","Pricing trends remained relatively consistent with renewal rate change still slightly positive at the end of the year, while new business volume in our domestic business saw a modest increase.","Turning to the quarter's financial results, operating income was $566 million with a very strong combined ratio of 89.6. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development was 94.4%, up a half a point compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to a higher level of non- cat weather related losses.","Looking at the topline, net written premiums for the quarter were down about 1.5 points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 with domestic business insurance premiums up about a point.","In domestic business insurance we remain pleased with the continued execution of our pricing strategy. As we've been saying for some time, given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business our focus continues to be on retention and accordingly we\u2019re very pleased that retention improved to a record 85% in the quarter.","Renewal premium change came in at 2.4 points, while renewal rate change remained positive but down slightly versus the third quarter. New business of $476 million was up compared to both the prior year and the third quarter.","Looking at each of our individual domestic businesses beginning with Select, rate in renewal premium change were in line with recent quarters while retention remains strong at 82% demonstrating continued stability in this segment of the market.","In the middle market, we achieved record retention of 88%, overall rate change was about flat and reflected a decline of about a point from the third quarter. As we've always said, the execution below the headline numbers is what matters and we continue to see a great about the granular results.","Retention for our best performing business was just over 90% within average rate decline of less than 2% on those accounts, while for our poor performing business we continued to get a rate in excess of loss trend.","In terms of exposure, the quarter's results include a drag of about a point from our oil and gas business resulting from reduced economic activity due to lower energy prices. Just as a reference point, our oil and gas business makes up only about 3% of domestic business insurance written premium. Middle market new business of $254 million was up from the third quarter and in line with the prior year.","In other business insurance retention was strong at 80%, renewal rate change was about flat even after being negatively impacted by our national property business. As I mentioned last quarter,","although national property is seeing the largest rate declines of any business in our portfolio, we are pleased with the overall performance of this business.","Returns and retention remains strong and pricing trends are stable. Excluding national property, renewal rate change for other business insurance remains positive and was relatively stable with the third quarter.","Turning to international, net written premiums were down about 16% for the quarter and 14% for the full year primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rate. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums for the fourth quarter were down about 6% largely driven by declines in retention in Canada and to a lesser extent at Lloyd's.","International retention was down in the quarter to 79%, however renewal premium change was slightly positive and new business for the quarter was very strong at $80 million up 18% year-over-year.","In Canada, our competitive renewal environment adversely impacted retention across our book. However in June, we launched Optima, our new strategic insurance platform in Canada for personal insurance. Optima was modeled after our U.S. based Quantum Auto 2.0. product. We\u2019re in the early days of the roll-out but are pleased with the initial response as we are seeing a significant increase in new business volume.","In Lloyd\u2019s, we continue to see a challenging markets resulting from global economic conditions particularly in our marine business. Offsetting this pressure, our two new business products that we have recently launched focused on renewable energy and global construction and early returns are encouraging.","So all in for the segment, it was a terrific 2015 with strong financial results and what we see as a remarkably stable environment when our competitive advantages really matter to our customers and agents. ","Before I turn it over to Doreen, I want to make one comment on our outlook for operating margins which we include in our quarterly fillings. Since our 10-K won\u2019t be filed for a few weeks, I would note that we expect our 2016 underlying underwriting margins for the segment will be broadly consistent with 2015. This is subject to the usual caveats and forward looking statement disclaimers.","With that, let me turn it over to Doreen.","Doreen Spadorcia","Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. Bond & Specialty Insurance finished 2015 with another quarter of exceptional financial results. Operating income for the quarter was 162 million down from the fourth quarter of 2014 due to lower net favorable prior year reserve development but overall still a great result.","The underlying combined ratio of 80.7 was three point, four points better than the prior year quarter due primarily to two factors, a modest increase in a loss ratio in the prior year quarter that resulted from a re-estimation of the first three quarters of 2014, and secondly the impact of certain customer related intangible assets which became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2015.","Underlying underwriting results continue to run well within our long term target ranges and as Alan mentioned, the full year underlying combined ratio of 80.1 was an all time best. We obviously don't think these results come by accident. We pride ourselves on maintaining the underwriting discipline, aggressive management of risk and limits, strong accountant and agency relationship, analytics and claims management that drive these results. ","As we look ahead to 2016 for this segment, we expect underlying underwriting margin to remain broadly consistent with 2015. As for top line net written premiums in the aggregate were down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a decline in surety volume driven by lower bonding needs for our accounts particularly as compared to the strong production in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Surety production can vary significantly quarter-over-quarter based on the number, size and timing of bonded construction projects awarded to our customers. We have a strong portfolio of surety clients and believe we remain well positioned to capitalize on increased bonding needs that might result from an improved economy.","Across our management liability businesses, retention remains strong at 85% while new business premium was up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Renewal premium changed trended down with lower rate being partially offset by an increase in other RPC which includes changes in the size of insured exposures, in the midst written attachment point and policy duration. The lower rate was as expected and is consistent with the strong profitability of our portfolio. So all-in-all, another great quarter closing a strong year for Bond & Specialty Insurance.","I'll turn now to personal insurance where we closed out the year with another quarter of exceptional underwriting results. So the segment operating income for the quarter was 222 million and the underlying combined ratio was 86.2%. Great results and as we move forward the segment remains positioned to perform in line with our long term return growth.","I'll touch on the quarterly results for agency auto and agency property in a moment but first I\u2019d like to share with you some thoughts on how we view the underlying health of these businesses. First for auto, I\u2019ll start by saying how pleased we are with the vibrancy of our auto business. The market response from both agents and consumers to Quantum Auto 2.0 remains incredibly strong and the portfolio is positioned to generate financial returns within our long term target range.","In the agency channel we added 167,000 policies during 2015, an 8% increase from the end of 2014. As always there remains competition in auto and we remain committed to keeping our products priced accordingly through disciplined expense management and superior pricing and underwriting segmentation.","As we look ahead to 2016, we expect the auto business to continue to grow in both policy accounts and premium volume although at a more moderated percentage than 2015 as the portfolio grows.","As per agency auto profitability, we\u2019ve mentioned on several occasions that we\u2019re comfortable with where our margins are given the current market environment. That still remains the case today. The full year underlying agency combined ratio of just under 97% was in line with our expectations for the year and a result we are pleased with.","This combined ratio is somewhat higher than our long term goal. We have been particular by the amount of new business that we've added over the past two years.","Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced to our long term target returns. But as you all know, the relatively higher combined ratio of new business improves over time. As we look into 2016, the significant volume of new business we've added will drive a slightly higher calendar year combined ratio, compared to 2015.","So far the profitability of Quantum Auto 2.0 is maturing in line with our expectation. With this return profile, we continue to seek more new business as it should be accretive to long term return.","In homeowner, the financial returns generated in the last couple of years have been exceptional and well within our target range. As you recall, we made significant improvement in the risk profile of this business over the last few years including changes in deductibles, other terms and conditions, and tightened underwriting guidelines.","Of course, this is a more volatile business that will always have a weather dynamic to it. The weather in the last couple of years has been somewhat lower than our model suggested. But we know that won't always be the case.","As we look ahead to 2016, we expect the profitability - we do expect underlying underwriting margins in agency homeowners and other to be lower than 2015 reflecting more normalized levels of loss activity.","As Alan mentioned, we are also very pleased with the improvements we've seen in homeowners production. This is attributable in part to account rounding along with making some localized pricing and process adjustments. And certainly the turnaround benefited from the momentum and agent engagement from the roll-out of Quantum Auto 2.0.","At this point, the business has leveled-off from a policies and force perspective and we expect modest growth in 2016.","Now, I'll just highlight a couple of things specific to the quarter. Looking at agency auto, new business premium was up 32% and net premium was up 12% from fourth quarter 2014 level and we have added 51,000 policies during the quarter.","The combined ratio for the quarter was 98.1 and included over two points of favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio was a 100.2, up from the prior year due predominantly to adverse weather in this year's quarter and the benefit in the prior year quarter of a 2.5 point favorable re-estimation of losses related to the first three quarters of 2014.","As per loss trend in auto, our view of normalized frequency and severity remained consistent with recent quarters at around 3% in aggregate. There continues to be a lot of discussion about trend, particularly increase in frequency. From our advantage point, while we may observe normal fluctuations in any particular period due to things like weather, we see a stable and unchanged long term frequency trend.","As always, we continue to monitor external information and our own data closely using our expenses analytic capability.","Turning to agency homeowners and other for the quarter, we once again had strong financial results despite relatively active weather in the month of December. The underlying combined ratio of 59.5 was slightly higher than the exceptionally favorable prior year quarter.","As for production, new business premiums were up 27% from the prior year quarter and continue to trend favorably, while retention remained strong at 85%. Policies in force were up slightly both sequentially from last quarter and from the fourth quarter of 2014.","So to sum up personal insurance, we are exceptionally proud of the year we've had and look forward to more of the same in 2016.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabi.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you, Doreen. Tina, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. If I can ask you all to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you very much. Tina, go ahead please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb","Thank you and good morning. The first question I had was on the potential for share buyback. Alan, any change in view in terms of deploying loan excess annual earnings and share buybacks - got buybacks is \u2013 just slightly annually over the past - thinking we might put that trend in place for 2016, 2017 as well.","Alan Schnitzer","Jay, good morning. Thanks for the question. No change in strategy or approach to share buybacks or capital management overall and there is no intent to this, it's never been an effort to deploy more than earnings right. We had excess capital in past years and we made that very clear that we were sort of adding that to our annual income to buy back stock but, we said I don't know, a year or two ago that our level of buybacks would be tied to our level of income.","And so we\u2019ll have a level of earnings, we\u2019ll do what we need to do with it whether that\u2019s making pension contributions or investments in the business and we\u2019ll take what\u2019s left in and return that to shareholders and there won\u2019t be a perfect correlation between earnings in a year and share buybacks in a year. There is some timing differences but I think as we said pretty consistently recently, share buybacks going forward will be tied to earnings.","Jay Gelb","Okay. And then on the investment income from the non-fixed income investments, it was clearly impacted by lower energy prices in 4Q and given the collapse in energy prices so far this year, I\u2019m just trying to get a base on what you might expect for 2016, is that $25 million results, taking ahead lower on a quarterly basis from what we saw in 4Q.","Jay Benet","Let me just clarify one thing, $25 million that relates to fixed income portfolio not the non-fixed income portfolio.","Bill Heyman","Jay, its Bill Heyman. Obviously this week is a hard week from which to extrapolate for the rest of the year. The marks as of year-end reflected a price which was an oil price higher than the price which obtained today but not by as much as one might think. During the year most funds wrote down their holdings and in some cases after the write-downs the price of petroleum rose but nothing was written up again.","So we think a lot of these portfolios have been marked pretty hard. That said, if we had to predict either way, there is probably a little downside left in the portfolio but the portfolio isn\u2019t that big that the amount are to be material then the aggregate.","Jay Benet","Okay, that's helpful for a starting point. And Jay just to clarify, so as talking about the $25 million of income in 4Q from the non-fixed income investment portfolio in terms of the \u2013 fixed income, I understand what you were saying in terms of lower - ","Jay Gelb","I apologize for the confusion there.","Jay Benet","That's okay, no problem so, but Bill you\u2019re saying that $25 million after tax we saw in 4Q shouldn't be that impacted by lower energy prices even so far.","Bill Heyman","No, I couldn\u2019t put a number on this especially after the first part of this month but I\u2019m simply saying that everyone assumes that there is a lot of downside based on prices as they are today and there might be less downside than it appears simply because of the way in which funds mark their holdings in 2015. ","Jay Gelb","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you, Tina. Next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Randy Binner of FBR & Co. Please go ahead.","Randy Binner","I think you touched on this in the opening commentary but from my perspective the pricing - the headline pricing number you provided in the slide-deck the plus 0.6% was better than expected and I guess I\u2019m interested in your perspective and if you think Travelers is unique here, a lot of the headlines surveys that we will get in the industry for commercial lines are moving significantly negative across the board.","So I just want to get your perspective on it if you think Travelers is unique here and how kind of much discipline I guess you think - your competitors are holding against the software market?","Alan Schnitzer","Randy, good morning it\u2019s Alan. You said it was a surprise, it wasn't a so a surprise to us, it may've been a surprise to you or others but relatively to the surveys what we can tell you is, we\u2019re showing a real data and I think what we\u2019ve always seen is surveys tend to be anecdotally based and tend to maybe over emphasize some volatility either up or down because maybe the people respond to the surveys or thinking about the last transaction or the transactions in their mind.","So there is really nothing about this that surprises us and you know we've been saying for a while that we expect the amplitude of the market to moderate. This appears to have moderated and I think you know the fact that we can achieve what we did is, I think a function of two things, one our data and analytics, our expertise, our ability to execute at a very, very granular level and a marketplace that is, we would describe as remarkably stable and at the moment rational.","Randy Binner","Just a quick follow up, are there any lines that are really helping that figure, meaning is workers\u2019 comp still kind of the best from a pricing perspective where some other casually lines might be moving negative?","Brian MacLean","No, this is Brian. It's still a pretty tight band to be honest with you across all the lines. So nothing is dramatically out of pattern up or down. As we commented and Alan touched on in his comments and I in mine, it\u2019s a more larger accounts feeling more pressure than medium and smaller accounts as we said national property is the space where we\u2019re seeing you know more significant rate declines than others. So I think it\u2019s more an account size than a line of business volatility or variability.","Randy Binner","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Nannizzi","I guess Doreen maybe a little bit more on the auto side, have you seen any impact from the rise in miles driven in your auto book just given the fact that your growth is sort of come alongside that rise in miles driven?","Doreen Spadorcia","So let me just talk a little bit about miles driven. The data shows that probably year-to-date the miles driven are up about 2.5% per capita and there is still a lot of debate about whether that makes a difference if it's a long trip, a short trip, whether there is unemployment, whether you have safety features in your vehicles, and so you know we watch that closely but our long term trend of 3% anticipate that and we really haven't seen anything that that particular item is causing us to view frequency differently today.","Brian MacLean","And just to be crystal clear, the 3% is total trend where the frequency being a small fraction of it.","Michael Nannizzi","And then I guess in middle market, I mean with retention up in the high 80s, is that something that you could see that maybe coming down or would you be comfortable with that at a lower level if you saw an opportunity to find some more rate increase opportunities. Just seems like high 80s if pricing is flat and the result are pretty good, I mean is that an area where you could look to push for some more rate at some point?","Brian MacLean","This is Brian again. That is a constant balancing act in our organization every day. I will tell you that overall our core middle market business from a return perspective is in a very healthy spot and as I said in the comments when we look at our better performing business which is not a tiny part of the portfolio, our very well performing business, we are at retentions north of 90 with pretty modest price increases.","We\u2019d obviously love to renew it in the 90s with different price increases but retaining that business is a real priority because it is returning very, very well.","With that said, we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to see where we can balance the rate and retention trade off.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, I'd add to that that, even though that\u2019s not the headline number, that continues to be a headline number and the execution below that number is very, very granular. So we\u2019re not managing that headline number, we\u2019re managing every single account.","Michael Nannizzi","And just real quick. Alan or Bill, did you guys disclose - definitely appreciate your scores on the energy portfolio. Do you guys disclose anywhere you have the BBB minus category of energy exposure as well just that sort of next rating level up?","Alan Schnitzer","Well, I can say that the investment grade portfolio has an average rating of single A and the high-yield portfolio, which is 23 credits with book value of $162 million has an average rating of BB minus, which given the size or to give you what you need.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Josh Stirling","I was just thinking may you live an interesting times. You've had good fortune here to become CEO at the time the industry structure is changing very rapidly. I mean obviously over the past six months, we've seen ACE and Chubb merge. It creates a very large and powerful competitor. And on the other hand over at AIG there is presumably going to be lots of opportunities for everyone in the industry.","As you thought from Travelers perspective, how the environment is evolving, how are you guys going to sort of tackle these new challenges and opportunities and what should we do to seek Travelers take advantage of all these change in the market?","Alan Schnitzer","So I guess what I would share with you is that we are very aware and deeply engaged in all of those things. So whether that's - what's going on with any of our competitors or what's going on with technology or big data or driverless cars, consolidation among distribution, you could go on and on. I think what I would share with you is we're very aware and deeply engaged.","As we see all of those things and others, those by the way weren't meant to be necessarily in order what's top in my mind, just what came to my mind but as we think of everything that's got the potential to change in this marketplace, nothing is going to change overnight. These are things that are all going to evolve and develop overtime. And what we've got great confidence in is our positioning to manage all of them.","So we think we can understand and manage. We've got the talent, we've got the resources, we've got a deep understanding of risk and reward. And the quality of our underlying business, the results you see this quarter and this year, we've got no distractions.","So we are starting from a really good point as we think about and engage on all of those issues. And without taking one by one, for the most part and maybe all in, we see more opportunities than we do risk. But we're certainly examining them from both sides making sure that where there is opportunity, we're positioning ourselves to be able to leverage it and where there is risk that we're making sure we do everything we need to do to mitigate it.","Josh Stirling","I wonder if we could maybe just switch gears a little bit. You've mentioned risk. Could you give us a little bit of - either Alan or Brian or whoever is appropriate, a little bit of help of understanding what the liability side exposures maybe not Travelers per say, but generally for the industry from a meltdown and the commodities and energy patch would be.","I mean presumably, we might see a bunch of bankruptcies, use a lot of different product lines that everybody in the industry sells under companies. And I remember a decade or so ago, Chubb really surprised people when they had got hurt and energy surety deal with Enron. And obviously both D&O and E&O exposures and maybe work comps severity.","So I'm sure you guys are playing defense here. I'm wondering if you can help us sort of things through how you and your underwriters are thinking about potential exposures if they've had part of the role keeps getting hurt.","Alan Schnitzer","I'll start and I'll look at either Brian or Doreen, and invite them to jump in. I'll say you sort of hit it. We think about the loss side of that equation all the time and whether it's going to our measure and liability book or surety book making sure that we understand what our exposures are. And I'll say that we look at these things - we don't wait for there to be something significant in the marketplace to look at it, we're looking at it all the time and as far out as we can.","So we're managing our nets, we're looking on the surety side what kind of collateral we have for instance on some of these accounts. We exit accounts when we need to exit accounts. But we've got a really good track record I think in all of those businesses.","So just on manageable liability side, for example, we're much more heavily waited on the private non-profit side as opposed to the large public D&O. And so it's - this is what we do every day is manage risk and think about risk and reward.","Doreen Spadorcia","The only thing I'd add to that is that when we see any potential issue, we run that through our entire book of business not just what that class of business is. So we look at all the consequential effects that they may have on related industries.","And so for example in writing bank we look at the level of their portfolios that are exposed not just to oil and gas, but any one thing in particular. So obviously, surety watching credit and looking at collateral, other management liability areas looking at concentration, but this is unique to us. We always take an issue and run it through the entire book and look at any consequences that might come from that.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ryan Tunis","I think my first question is for Brian. And I think he mentioned in his prepared remarks that in middle market I think the better accounts you were - renewing I think with the modest rate decline. The decline, but it's kind of like it was only modest.","I guess I'm just curious how is the conversation changing with those better accounts, now versus maybe a year ago. Right now like I said, something maybe a modest decline, I mean is that kind of where - whatever one is kind of looking for is still just modest or - how's that conversation evolving?","Brian MacLean","It's pretty much as you're saying and as you would expect based on the data. A couple of years ago, almost every conversation was starting with some form of price increase even for the best accounts, because everybody saw where the trends were and that is gradually mitigated overtime.","But even with those better accounts, the conversation start somewhere with trying to renew it at a modest decline or flat. Obviously, if the average is less than 2% there is still some that are positive.","The thing that we're doing probably a little different than we were a year or two ago is we're really trying to get out as early as possible frequently at least three if not six months ahead of time, have conversations with the broker and the account. I think we do have a strong franchise with a valued product and valued services. And fortunately most of those company start by wanting to stay with us.","And then I think the other key point is really being able to have the data and analytics where our frontline people can see and really segment their portfolio and in the middle market account by account. Look at how they're performing. And when there are issues either in that account, in that line or in that class of business being able to have an informed conversation with the broker about what those are and why we're trying to do what we're doing on the account really, really makes a difference.","So I'd say the big change is getting out early and having a kind of granular conversation on the performance of that line and that business.","Ryan Tunis","My follow up was actually follow-up to Jay's question on capital return and excessive operating income. I guess since the start of 2014, we see like your premiums surplus ratio has drifted up from about 1% to 1.2%. Leverage has been relatively flat. You've said over the past couple of years you've had access. You've been able to deploy. How do we think about that level of access? Just because on those metrics it does seem like whatever access you did have, you have sort of used to at certain extend. Are those metrics even relevant?","Jay Benet","The premium to surplus ratio, I would view as not being relevant at all. I mean that was a ratio that was used at a time when rating agencies and regulators didn't have the sophisticated models they have today.","So I've said on previous calls, we deal with each one of the models whether it's our internal models, regulatory models or the rating agency models to come to a place where given the profile of our business as it relates to each quarter what is the capital that we think we need in the operating entities that we manage to support AA rating and support a solid AA rating, not one with the wind blows we're worried about our ratings going down.","So that's always the starting point. Given the size of our book, it doesn't change very much from quarter to quarter, but what does change is the profitability in each quarter. So there are some quarters where the profitability whether it's for favorable development or some other things to take place, it's higher than our expectations keeping in mind that we have a flow of monies out of the operating companies up to the holding company each quarter based on expectation.","So to the extend we earn more. We bring some more up probably a little later than that. I think if you go back over time and you go pass two years ago to an earlier period and start adding up, the earning versus the share repurchase that you see that there is a very, very strong correlation to that. So I wouldn't read into anything that says one year we've done a little more than earnings, in other year we did less.","It's really just as Alan said earlier the timing. The premium to surplus ratio goes up a little bit, I've kind of ignored that and what I would look at is in our supplement, we talk about specifically on a quarterly basis what the stat surplus is. And I think you can see that, that moves around probably in a pretty narrow band.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Vinay Misquith","Just a question on loss cost trend and the pricing roughly flat. Curious how you\u2019re managing to leave margins flat in '16 versus '15?","Brian MacLean","So this is Brian. And speaking for the BII segment, you start with the kind of simple arithmetic of the earned premium. And again it's not just rate, its price, which includes exposure change and does offset some of trends.","So when we look at the arithmetic of earned rate versus loss trend, we come up with a very modest about a 0.5% of loss ratio compression into 2016. And that of course is based on our assumption of loss trend, which is as we've said running right now at about 4% and looking at a relatively stable orderly marketplace.","And then that's offset by a variety of other factors you can think of whether large losses mix change underwriting actions, et cetera. But the real starting point is that compression from the rate loss trend dynamic, price loss trends dynamic is a pretty modest number in how we're looking at it.","Alan Schnitzer","And I think that distinction between price and rate is important, because as we said in the past there is a meaningful component of exposure that from a profitability perspective behaves like rate. And so what we really see in that true margin deterioration, is we see going forward as Brian said it's very small and probably within the margin of error of all the other things that impact margin.","Vinay Misquith","The second question is on the pace of future rate increases you mentioned that on a best counts you have, rate decreases of less than 2%. So curious to what proportion of the accounts now are well performing. So should we see sort for the pressure on pricing this year, because more of the accounts are better performing?","Alan Schnitzer","I think there is a level of granularity and precision here that's for competitive reasons. I'm not going to overly segment the portfolio. I think the backdrop to this is really the view of, do we think the industry is going to continue to fundamentally be focused on the returns on the products. And we think that's the right way to be thinking about the business and we're optimistic that the majority of the marketplace is actually looking at that.","So the healthier the business, the more pressure there should be on pricing, but in the aggregate we're pretty comfortable that we should be able to generate appropriate with pricing to maintain reasonable returns. And then you can come up with any variation on the theme you want off of that and be as bullish or as bearish as you want.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Charles Sebaski","I have couple of question I guess on the personal lines business. I guess the first on the personal auto growth and the success you had from Quantum. Is that coming from standalone auto policies? I guess I'm trying to just understand that you kind of sweet spot seems to be on package, multi policy programs. You have auto growth while homeowners' is flat. Just kind of, wondering how you're working in the auto growth relative to your, kind of, packaged program?","Doreen Spadorcia","Good morning, this is Doreen. We've actually seen success in force. I think this was some of what Alan and I referred to in our earlier comments. Clearly our auto product was competitive in agent's office and also in the direct channel. And in many cases, what that did, because we are an account focused company, that allowed us then to bring the home with it.","So we've seen standalone auto come in, we've seen more opportunities for cross-selling. And I don't think it's anything small, given Quantum Auto 2.0 that we've been able to actually increase and stop the shrinkage in homeowners.","We've also put some processes in place that have been very helpful where it prefills certain information so that if someone is looking at an auto quote, it will prefill for home. So we like the account business, we continue to look for that. But given where the returns are and where we're going with auto, we are pleased with that as well.","Charles Sebaski","Just a follow up to a comment that you guys made in the business insurance regarding the exposure drag and the oil and gas exposure, I think you said that oil and gas accounted for one point exposure drag but that oil and gas only accounted for 3% of the book, or is that 3% of the exposure? I guess I was trying to understand how 3% could account for a one point drag.","Jay Benet","The 3% is a premium number but the exposure, as you can imagine, was down pretty significantly. So when you've combined the 3% against a pretty big exposure delta in oil and gas, that drove the 1%.","Gabriella Nawi","And the 3% is the total domestic business insurance, not to middle market in that written premium.","Jay Benet","So that's a good point and maybe we shouldn't mix those two numbers. The 1% drag was on the middle market exposure change. The 3% was on total domestic BI. So we did that arithmetic quickly. ","Alan Schnitzer","The 3% is the premium, the book. The 1% is on the charge and the exposure. The 1% exposure drag is middle market exposure, the 3% is quantifying a percentage of the premiums of our oil and gas business on the total business insurance.","Jay Benet","Right. The premium on just middle market would be a higher number.","Charles Sebaski","The math just didn't seem to work, I appreciate the clarity.","Gabriella Nawi","Great. And this will be our last and final question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan","First question is on reserve releases. Looks like workers comp have releases in 2014 accident year, just curious while it is already release rather than for this - normally a long tail line of basis, can you talk also in general, what's loss cost trend by major lines and how that compare with your 4% assumption in overall loss cost trends?","Jay Benet","This is Jay Benet. Just in terms of the reserve release, when you're dealing with a long tail line, you've two components to how you're going to look to results. One is, what has developed in terms of loss activity, and you're absolutely right. In a short period of time, you're not going to really see a great deal of activity.","On the other hand, what you've done is, you established the starting point for what you think the loss activity is going to be and we refer to that as the loss pick. So just imagine on January 1, trying to predict what the losses are going to be for the entire period of time as those workers comp policies will be out there.","And we come up with a loss pick, and the example I'm going to use, I'm just making up a number, let's say it's 60%, based on what you've seen historically. And looking at the historical data then for earlier accident years and evaluating that against that initial loss pick that you had for a current year and there were times when you see loss activity in prior years that you say, that really has no barring whatsoever on how I thought about the starting point for the current year and then there are times, when you look at it and say, no actually this really does change the bar for the starting point.","So usually on a long tail line of business when you see us do what we\u2019ve done here, it's based on what we refer to is base here moment. Looking at the history and just saying that, the initial loss pick was a little on the high side.","A \u2013 Brian MacLean","This is Brian. Just to respond to your - trend by line in business is actually a pretty tight band with ranging from the high 3s to the high 4s but an average trend of right around 4%. So nothing is really out of pattern by line.","Kai Pan","My follow up question is for Alan. Now you have 7 weeks on the new role, so I just wonder what\u2019s your top priority these days and what you think - you have the right strategy in place now, but what are you focusing on?","Alan Schnitzer","Sure. Thanks for the question Kai. So I had experienced managing essentially all of our commercial business and our businesses outside the U.S. what I haven't had experienced with is, the personalized business on a relative basis not as much, personalized business in some of our functions like claim and IT and ops and things like that, risk control, so, I\u2019m trying to spend a lot of time in those businesses and areas that I haven't had the experience with, trying to spend a lot of time on the road out in the field with distribution and our employees in the field which has always been a priority of mine.","And I guess beyond that in my comments I said one of the things that we\u2019re going to do is continue to evolve and innovate and reassessing is something that we\u2019ve always done and Jay Fishman has always led that initiative.","And so I have taken that over from Jay and just like Jay didn\u2019t do it alone, Jay did it with the group, I\u2019ll continue to leave the group in making sure that we\u2019re accessing what\u2019s going on in the marketplace and we\u2019re evolving and innovating.","So I would say that makes up so the way I'm allocating my turn.","Kai Pan","Thank you very much for all the answers.","Gabriella Nawi","Great. Thank you very much for joining us today. As always, the Investors Relation team is available for any follow up questions you might have.

By now you have seen our second quarter results and as you can see from the release it was another strong quarter contributing to a very strong first half of 2015.","We reported operating income of $806 million and an operating return on equity of 14.2%, bringing our year-to-date results to $1.6 billion in operating income and a 14.3% operating return on equity. We achieved these results through strong underwriting performance and solid investment performance consistent with our expectations.","Most importantly, our long-term average annual operating return on equity now stands at 13.4% well in excess of a cost of capital. This quarter is another brick in the wall of exceptional long-term performance. For all of the recent market commentary about the industry, our experience remains business as usual.","At the point of sale, where business is actually conducted that is one agent, one underwriter dealing with one account, things are very stable and just fine. In fact, the commercial insurance marketplace dynamics over the last six months have been remarkably consistent with what we believe would happen and have been far different from the historical conventional wisdom.","We continue to believe that the amplitude of the cyclicality that our industry will deal with is much less than would have been the case historically and you can trace that comment back to our Investor Day in May of 2007; and of course while things can change, so far so good. Anticipating that some of you are going to ask us about our take on the recent consolidation in the primary P&C industry, let me make a few observations.","No primary P&C insurer has come together over the past two decades through acquisition activity more than we have. We are very good at it and while we haven't announced any mega transactions in a number of years, our shareholders should expect that we are aware of the possibilities and that we are expert at evaluating them. That evaluation comes down to determining the best way to create shareholder value.","The return driven strategy that we\u2019ve been executing for nearly a decade now has been highly successful in creating shareholder value. Our total return to shareholders over virtually whatever period you want to pick is at the top of the heap. So, when we evaluate M&A opportunities, which we do all the time, we evaluate them against that standard.","As it relates to Chubb, when we consider the modest opportunity to improve the performance of an already high performing company with some of the best people in the industry, the high degree of risk inherent in combining two successful, but very different cultures and the significant impact on returns on equity from the combination of the premium we expect it would be required, as well as all of the required purchase accounting adjustments. The return just didn't measure up.","We have the luxury of a plan A that sets a very high bar, a strategy that comes from having highly differentiated competitive advantages and highly successful business franchises with industry-leading product breath. Again, we believe that our total return to shareholders over the recent past, as well as over the longer term speaks for itself and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver superior returns, but we do keep looking at M&A opportunities and when we believe there is a transaction that contributes to creating shareholder value, we will make every effort to complete it.","Other than addressing the potential market implications of the transaction, which Brian will do, I hope this addresses your questions on the topic. We really don't expect to comment further on that recently announced transaction. And with that I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Jay Benet.","Jay Benet","Thanks Jay. As Jay said, we are very pleased with our second quarter results. Operating income of $806 million, up 20% from the prior year quarter, and operating return on equity of 14.2%. Current quarter operating income was driven by a very strong consolidated combined ratio of 90.8%, which was 4.3 points better than the prior year quarter, due to strong underlying underwriting performance, continued net favorable prior year reserve development and lower catastrophe losses, as well as the inclusion of a $32 million benefit from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters.","Operating income was also driven by solid net investment income consistent with our expenses expectations, although lower than in the prior year quarter. Brian, Alan, and Doreen will talk more about underlying results in a little while, so let me say a few words about NII. As was the case in the first quarter, current quarter net investment income is being compared to a very strong quarter last year.","Fixed income NII of $431 million after-tax is down $32 million from the prior year quarter, principally due to what we have been saying for many years, securities that had higher book yields have run-off during the past 12 months and have been replaced with securities having lower yields due to the current interest rate environment. Another contributing factor to lower fixed income NII was the modest reduction in average investments that resulted in part from the company's $579 million first quarter 2015 payment to settle the Asbestos Direct Action Litigation.","Non-fixed income NII of $79 million after-tax was down $16 million from the prior year quarter, due to lower returns for energy-related private equity investments. These investments produced negative NII of $9 million after-tax this quarter, which was better than the negative NII of $21 million in the first quarter as compared to positive NII of $11 million after tax in the prior year quarter.","As I mentioned, earnings continues to benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development, which amounted to $207 million pre-tax this quarter, up $24 million from the prior year quarter. In business and international insurance net favorable development of $103 million pretax resulted from better than expected loss experience in several different product lines, including workers comp for accident years 2006 and prior, GL for 2008 through 2013, Lloyd\u2019s in Canada and property in both CMP and the property product line for more recent accident years, partially offset by a $47 million after-tax versus $72 million pretax increase to environmental reserves.","In bond and specialty insurance, net favorable development of $40 million pretax resulted from better than expected loss experience in contract surety for 2010 through 2013. And in personal insurance, net favorable development of $64 million pretax resulted from better than expected loss experience in homeowners and other liability for 2011 through 2014; and for non-CAT weather-related losses for 2014, as well as better than expected loss experience in auto liability for 2012 through 2014.","On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs there were no accident years or product lines that had any meaningful unfavorable development this quarter or year to date. Second quarter operating cash flows were also strong at $676 million, up $51 million from the prior year quarter, while holding company liquidity ended the quarter at over $1.7 billion and all of our capital ratios remained at or better than their target levels.","Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.1 billion pretax or $1.4 billion after tax, down from $3 billion and $2 billion respectively at the beginning of the year, due to the recent rise in interest rates causing book value per share at $77.51 to grow by only 1% from the beginning of the year. Importantly, adjusted book value per share of $73.09, which eliminates the impact of unrealized investment gains grew by 3% during this time period.","We continue to generate much more capital than we needed to support our business and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned almost $1 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $194 million and common share repurchases of $801 million bringing total capital returned to shareholders to almost $1.85 billion year-to-date.","Before turning the microphone over to Brian there is one more topic I would like to cover, our cat reinsurance coverage. As you may recall, effective January 1 of this year, we significantly increased the attachment point of our Gen CAT reinsurance by replacing our previous Gen CAT treaties, the $400 million CAT aggregate of excess of loss treaty, which expired as scheduled on December 31 and the $400 million Gen CAT treaty, which our reinsurers agreed to terminate early as of that date with the new aggregate ex-OL treaty that provides coverage for both single events and accumulation of losses from multiple events.","$1.5 billion of coverage part of $2 billion, excess of $3 billion, after $100 million deductible per occurrence. By doing this, we retain the same broad pharaoh and geographic coverage as the former Gen CAT and ex-OL treaties, while positioning the coverage layer to provide a significant buffer between earnings and capital.","During the second quarter, we repositioned our Northeast specific cat coverage, lowering its attachment point from about $2 billion, while maintaining its maximum recovery. Our current combination of two Northeast CAT bonds and the new Northeast Gen CAT reinsurance treaty attaches at $1.058 billion of covered losses and provides $1.4 billion of coverage through $3.1 billion, the point at which the Gen CAT aggregate ex-OL treaty takes over.","Taken collectively, we increased our potential reinsurance recoveries and repositioned the attachment points to more closely align with the risks in our business, while spending essentially the same amount. A more complete description of our captains reinsurance coverage, including a description of new earthquake and international coverage\u2019s is included in our second quarter 10-Q, which we filed earlier today as well as in our 2014 10-K.","So with that now let me turn the mic over to Brian who is going to speak about underwriting results.","Brian MacLean","Thank you, Jay. Alan and Doreen will go over the segment details, but before they do I want to make a few comments about the macro environment. Echoing Jay's comments we're certainly very pleased with our results, both in the quarter and for the first half of 2015. We are at a 90% combined ratio year-to-date, very strong retention, stable renewal price increases and no major surprises in our loss trend.","In fact, results like this or what we spend our carriers hoping to achieve and here we are, but importantly we didn't get here by accident. We did it with the relentless and consistent execution on our strategies and by investing in and developing a broad rapid products and services and other meaningful sustainable competitive advantages in the markets we serve. But while we feel great and want to talk about how well we\u2019re positioned, I suspect many of you are also interested in our thoughts on the impact that the ACE\/Chubb transaction may have on the marketplace. So let me share a few thoughts on that.","First, we already compete against these two companies more so Chubb than ACE given our business and geographic focus and we don\u2019t anticipate a lot of difference in competing against them as a single entity. Any company that is large enough can disrupt the market if it\u2019s willing to accept meaningfully lower returns over time, but both ACE and Chubb were probably large enough to have done that before the transaction, so we don\u2019t see that risk being any different going forward.","Second, we have great long-term and trusted relationships with our important broker and agent partners and we don\u2019t see that being disrupted. We remain a leading independent agency commercial insurer in our principal market, the United States. And in Personal lines, we are the leading independent agency market in the Homeowners business and we don\u2019t generally compete in the high-end home product, which is Chubb\u2019s primary personal line focus.","Third, having completed a number of large scale transactions ourselves, we know that there inevitably will be disruption and dislocation of people and business. This will likely create near- and medium-term opportunities and it\u2019s possible we will benefit from these. Obviously, only time will tell what the long-term impact maybe. But as I said before, we feel great about Travelers. We remain very pleased with how our business is performing and more importantly how well we are positioned for opportunities in this marketplace going forward.","Before I turn the call over to Alan, I\u2019m sure that many of you have seen that recently we made some senior level organizational changes and I want to recognize a few of those folks on their new responsibility.","Greg Toczydlowski, who\u2019s done a fabulous job managing our personal insurance business, is moving over to business insurance to oversee our small commercial operation as well as take on responsibilities for technology, operations, and business platforms across all of Business Insurance.","Michael Klein, who had been managing our middle market commercial business, will take Greg\u2019s spot in Personal. Michael has had a broad range of experiences in his 25-plus years with the company and his management skills, knowledge of analytics in our products make him a perfectly suited to run the personal business.","Marc Schmittlein, who for the last 12 years has led our small commercial business, will take on the role of coordinating our cyber insurance efforts across our business. We see cyber coverage as an important opportunity in the marketplace.","Scott Higgins will assume leadership of our middle market commercial business and Darren Hinshaw [ph] has been appointed Chief Operating Officer of Personal Insurance. We are thrilled that we have this depth of management talent and the collaborative culture in which great people can thrive. After all, in this industry when we talk about competitive advantages, we start with talent and culture and to succeed you need both of them.","With that, let me turn it over to Alan to cover the Business Insurance and International segment.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you, Brian, and good morning. We delivered another quarter of strong performance in business and international insurance with operating income of $543 million. Our underlying combine ratio was relatively consistent with the prior year quarter at 93.1% reflecting attractive and stable product returns.","In terms of the top line, net written premiums decreased by a little over 1% from the prior year quarter. This was driven by our international business where net written premiums were down 15% primarily as a result of the adverse impact of foreign exchange.","Domestic business insurance net written premiums were up about a 0.5. In terms of our domestic production results, as Jay said, we remain pleased with the stability of the market as evidenced by historically high retention and positive rate change.","We\u2019ve commented for some time now, that this pricing has improved more of our portfolio is generating attractive returns and our objective has been to retain more of that business. We\u2019ve now posted a very strong 84% retention for two consecutive quarters.","As you can see on slide 9, excluding the impact of our large account property business, which I will get back to in a minute, positive renewal rate change and domestic BI was unchanged from the first quarter. Our ability to deliver these results comes from the excellent execution by our field organization of our very granular account by account and class by class strategy.","Turning to slide 10 in the webcast, in select retention hit a 6 year high, while renewal premium change moderated only slightly. In middle market, we posted a very strong retention and steady sequential renewal premium change. Notably within renewal premium change, renewal rate change has been remarkably steady over the past five months.","In terms of retention, we are retaining around 90% of our best performing business, while achieving renewal rate gains in excess of loss trend on our worst performing business. New business and middle market was down year-over-year. While we like the marketplace stability, one consequence of the stable market is the submission flow was down somewhat.","In other domestic business insurance, while renewal rate change turned negative this quarter as you can see on slide 12 of the webcast, the decrease is driven by national property, our large account property business. Excluding the impact of national property, renewal rate change in other domestic BI would have been a positive 1.9%.","To put it in context, national property accounts were about 25% of the net written premium and other domestic BI were only about 5% of the net written premium in this segment. Even with the rate change in national property, current pricing levels and returns in that business are attractive and accordingly, we have successfully driven retention to near record levels.","In our international business, retention continues to be strong and steady at 82% while renewal premium change of 1.5% was consistent with last quarter. New business is down over the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of disciplined underwriting and a competitive environment in Lloyd\u2019s and the impact of foreign exchange rates.","To sum it up, we are pleased with the stability in the marketplace and the results we delivered in the quarter and with the depth and breadth of our talent particularly in the field, our deep analytical capabilities and our market leading products and services, we are well positioned to continue to deliver superior results.","And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen.","Doreen Spadorcia","Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Bond and speciality insurance had another strong quarter with exceptional financial returns. For the quarter, operating income was $151 million, a reduction from the second quarter of 2014 driven by a lower level of net favourable prior year reserve development partially offset by a favourable resolution of prior year tax matters.","Underlying underwriting results remain very strong and well within our target. As for top line, net written premiums were generally flat to 2014. Across our management liability businesses, retention and new business premiums picked up modestly while renewal premium change was down slightly. So, great results for this segment.","I will now turn to personal insurance where we also had another terrific quarter with strong underwriting results in both agency auto and agency homeowners and other. For this segment, operating income for the quarter was $174 million, up significantly from the second quarter of 2014 due primarily to lower cat and non-cat weather and higher net favourable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio improved by more than a point from the prior year quarter, driven by favourable non-cat weather. We continue to feel great about the margins in this segment.","Looking at agency auto, we once again delivered strong top and bottom line results for the quarter and continue to be very pleased with the performance of this business. The 96.5% combined ratio for the quarter included 2.5 points of favourable prior year reserve development, which was driven by better than expected severity in bodily injury.","The underlying combined ratio of 96.9% continues to run in a range we are comfortable with, given current market condition. This result was up modestly from the prior year quarter due to a variety of small items including non-cat weather, which although materially favourable for homeowners, was slightly adverse year-over-year for auto.","Our loss trends remain consistent with recent quarters. Production results also continued to be strong driven by Quantum Auto 2.0 where we are now coming up on two years since the start of the roll out. New business premium was 37% higher than the second quarter of 2014 and we continue to grow policies in force, which increased more than 35,000 during the quarter. Net written premiums increased 7% from the prior year quarter. So, by all measures, great results for auto for the quarter.","Turning to agency homeowners and other, we once again delivered strong financial results with an underlying combined ratio of 77.5%, a 4 point improvement from the prior year quarter driven by relatively benign non-cat weather. Margins in this business remain well within our return expectations.","As for agency homeowners production, we are very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. New business premiums were up 33% from the prior year quarter and continued to trend favorably, while retention remained strong. Policies in force have leveled off and net written premiums are essentially flat from the prior year so the book has stabilized.","As we have said in prior quarters, this is an area of high focus for growth and we\u2019re encouraged with the positive results we\u2019re seeing. So to sum up, personal insurance another great quarter; and with that I\u2019ll turn the call back to Gabi.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take questions please. [Operator Instructions] Carlos, go ahead.","Operator","Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Randy Minor","Hi, great, thank you very much. So Travelers has followed the kind of the moderation in price decreases we've seen across commercial lines and so I was wondering if we could go a little more into detail and what you\u2019re seeing out there, what's causing that headline pricing number to moderate more as it approaches the zero level?","Alan Schnitzer","Randy it's Alan's Schnitzer, I\u2019ll take that. You guys focus on the headline rate number a lot more than we do. We\u2019re looking at this on an account by account basis and it will build up to whatever builds up to and at least in our performance I think what you see is, as more of our business is reaching rate adequacy our objective is to keep that business not to continue to necessarily get price on it. So, it really is a function of more of that business going over four years of rate increases to rate adequate for us and what you see in the headline number is just the aggregation of all those individual transactions.","Randy Minor","But is there, I know we focus on that number, but it is important for us, is there more, kind of more consistency or more rational behavior in the environment is there less, I mean I know Travelers is a big company and there is a lot going on, like property, for instance. But is there kind of less bad behavior out there in the most recent quarter compared to what we saw later last year?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, so Randy, I didn't mean to suggest that the number is not important, I\u2019m just suggesting we focus on it differently than you do because we\u2019re executing really on a very, very granular basis and we\u2019re looking at it one account at a time, but to get back to your other question I think when we talk about the market ourselves among ourselves and we talk to our field organization, we would say that by and large it does appear to be a pretty rational marketplace and it appears that there is a real return focus in the industry.","Jay Fishman","This is Jay Fishman. I think it\u2019s absolutely right. And Brian spoke about it as well it\u2019s - any one company if it\u2019s large enough and is willing to accept subpar returns over time can affect the marketplace from a pricing perspective, that\u2019s not been the case, it\u2019s not been the case for a long time. Now why that is, I actually think a lot of it is data and analytics and the fact that people actually understand their returns better than they did 10 years ago. No one would open knowingly say, well I\u2019m pricing this to produce subpar returns, I think that happened to some extent accidentally, not intentionally and so I think the data is different than the business, it\u2019s been different for some time. I get asked all the time, are we pleased or not that other people seem to be getting good at it? I think it is great. I think the more people understand the cost of goods sold in our business and the risks associated with it, the more we look like a normal financial services business and less of one that\u2019s operating in the dark. So, I think that we may have led this and I\u2019m sure we did, but the fact is that you see it in virtually everyone\u2019s reporting, greater reliance on analytics and return focus and that's I think what's causing it. We\u2019re allowing it to happen perhaps is a better expression.","Alan Schnitzer","And Randy the other thing I would point you to is the rate at which insurance companies by and large are returning capital to shareholders and if you look at that trend over long period of time, I think you will see a lot more capital being returned. So, to the extent capital can't be deployed at acceptable returns, I think you see a trend toward getting it back.","Randy Minor","All right. Thank you very much.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.","Kai Pan","Good morning, thank you. The first question regarding to the full -- the pricing trend. Just wonder if that -- if the trend stabilized, will we see the margin also stabilizing at this level or there could potentially be some margin pressure relatively to the loss cost or inside?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes Kai, it\u2019s Alan, let me take that as well. And I guess it depends on how you look at it. So let's just say rates are point or point and a half at the moment. We've said that loss trend is running at about four, so if you are looking on a very narrow basis at the relationship of those two things maybe you\u2019d say that rate isn't covering loss trend, but there is obviously a lot more in margin. So, you\u2019ve got volume mix, claims handling practices, underwriting initiatives, expenses whether all those things come through the margin every quarter and there is always going to be moments in those things. So, I would say that were rate and loss trend are sort of too close to call where margins are going to drift over time, given the current relationships of those two things.","Kai Pan","So, our non-CAT weather benefits the quarter overall?","Alan Schnitzer","Non-CAT weather in, weather overall in the quarter compared to the prior year was favorable if you take CATs and small weather. Small weather was about the same year-over-year.","Kai Pan","Okay, great. A follow-up question.","Alan Schnitzer","You know what, Kai I am sorry about that. I was looking at the wrong number. There was a benefit to quarter and small weather.","Kai Pan","Great. Follow up question on management succession, Jay you have been running the firm fabulously well like for the past 10 years and you also like some management change recently show you have a deep bench there. I just wonder what is the board consideration about manage succession planning?","Jay Fishman","Actually thank you for asking that question. I will actually answer it a little bit broader, just in case anybody really wants to, but it is uncomfortable because it is a perfectly reasonable question given our announcement a year ago about my health status, to ask about what's going on. So first I would observe that we\u2019ve been I would say as open as anyone can be about my own personal health status. And more importantly, perhaps most importantly I\u2019ve kept my partners and the Board of Directors here completely price knowledgeable, as I've done along in that process. I am very much on the job and fully engaged and at least from my own perspective there is no decline in my cognitive scale, may be others around here might disagree, but I don't feel I'm struggling in that regard. Now we've always taken succession planning seriously whether it was five years ago, when I was 57, if I did the math correctly, or now that I'm going to be 63 and dealing with health issue, it\u2019s no different, we take it as seriously now as we did then, and there is absolutely a plan in place, with certainty I will tell you that and for the moment all good and when we have more to say about succession and given the fact that I'm going to be 63, we will have more to say, we're going to say it and until then I\u2019m on the job and we\u2019re doing just fine.","Kai Pan","Great, well thank you so much.","Jay Fishman","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.","Michael Nannizzi","Thank you. I guess one question maybe for both Jay Fishman and Jay Benet on the capital generation, capital deployment timing, recently you been deploying more cash than you\u2019ve generated when we look at operating cash flows and the deduction for dividends and buybacks, is that something that you expect to continue to do just given capital efficiency that you're generating and you know when we think about potential M&A or capacity for M&A or maybe a desire to do something to bolt something on, does that pattern need to change to be able to create more of a base to start from? Thanks.","Jay Fishman","We\u2019re both to answer that because I think there are parts of it that are relevant to both of us. I just couldn't have imagined accumulating cash over the last 10 years hoping that there would be an acquisition opportunity that would make that judgment with hindsight look thoughtful. You all would have been highly critical, I suspect of that in our returns would have been considerably lower and one of the things I learned from working with Sandy for as long as I did is that if a transaction makes sense you get it financed, and that treating your shareholders\u2019 money like it\u2019s a bank account to be \u2013 to just sit on is really not appropriate. So I think we\u2019ve done exactly the right thing and when there is a transaction that we want to do, we will do it. We will go ahead and we will do it. So I will let Jay speak more to the capital and it\u2019s timing, but philosophically we\u2019ve done exactly what we wanted to do.","Jay Benet","And Jay said the keyword timing. In any quarter, our share repurchases is going to be based upon what our views of prior capital build up has been. So just because in one quarter or series of quarters, it\u2019s higher than what the earnings look like is really on an indication of a fundamental change in philosophy. It\u2019s still being driven by the creation of operating income and, therefore, capital in excess of what\u2019s need to support our business.","And we will look for opportunities to organically grow our business, which will require capital. There may be, as Jay said, some M&A activity that requires capital like we did in Brazil or with Dominion. But overall, it\u2019s a matter of finding those opportunities that provide the appropriate returns and where we don\u2019t find those opportunities, we return the excess capital on a real-time basis to you.","Michael Nannizzi","Thanks. And then maybe just a quick one for Doreen in personal lines. Any frequency trend as a result of kind of employment or other environmental factors that you saw in 2Q or departure from trends so far this year? And thank you Jay and Jay for those answers.","Doreen Spadorcia","We\u2019ve obviously been paying very close attention to miles driven and unemployment, which we\u2019ve heard others speak about. But I will tell you at this point, our trend is 3%, which it has been historically, so we are not seeing anything out of the ordinary. There has been a little bit of non-cat weather, but that was just in Q1, but our trend remains consistent.","Michael Nannizzi","Great. Thank you so much.","Doreen Spadorcia","You know what, I\u2019m sorry, I just wanted to correct. 3% is our trend overall, that includes frequency and severity. That\u2019s what I meant, but Gaby wanted to make sure.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. My first question is just a follow-up on the potential for industry consolidation. The last major deal I believe that Travelers had completed was the St. Paul merger around 12 years ago. And I just want to clarify that, if there\u2019s a large deal that presents itself strategically and financially, that Travelers feel is the right deal to do that, the company would be willing to issue stock for that?","Jay Fishman","Yes, no question about it. I would observe by the way that your \u2013 Dominion was for most people, that would be considered a not insignificant transaction on its own, but I grant you that the kind of mega transaction dates back to that one, yes.","Jay Gelb","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, with regard to the \u2013 I know you \u2013 I don't want to dig in too much on the commentary on Chubb. But I just wanted to clarify, did Travelers get a chance to look at the Chubb deal before ACE announced the transaction?","Jay Fishman","I said everything on the transaction I think that\u2019s appropriate for me to say.","Jay Gelb","Fair enough. And then finally, the third quarter annual asbestos review, it's probably in process. Any updates on that front?","Brian MacLean","No updates at this point. We do continually look at asbestos on a quarterly basis. We have the annual in depth claim review that takes place and we expect to complete that in the third quarter.","Jay Gelb","Okay. Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Josh Stirling","Good morning, and thank you for taking the call. So I wanted to talk a little bit about, not so much ACE and Chubb, about the company and so on and so forth per se, but just generally as the market evolves if there\u2019s going to be more concentration? In the independent agency market, there is maybe some more competition that comes from people that have to drive growth to pay for the revenue synergies that they promised, how does that play out?","You obviously have a bunch of claims capabilities and pricing capabilities, and you\u2019re sort of number one and number two with most of our agents. But is there going to be sort of a strategic need to get larger, to drive either greater market power or expense leverage or something like that? Or should we just imagine that this is \u2013 there is a lot of different companies, and you\u2019re going to basically stick to your knitting, looking at one policy at time, and sort of keep doing what you\u2019re doing?","Jay Fishman","Yeah, it\u2019s Jay Fishman. I answered the question at the end there. That\u2019s exactly right. We are going to keep doing what we are doing. There isn\u2019t anything that we expect will happen or contemplate will happen that would require any kind of change in our own strategy.","Now having said that, lots of companies that are out there, not just new ones, but old ones too and each of them operate everyday and present their offerings to agents and their services and their people, and we compete against all of them. And we expect we are going to continue to compete against all of them. And I\u2019d really don\u2019t anticipate any change.","The funny thing as I reflect on it often about taking a lower price to drive revenue synergies is that the arithmetic doesn\u2019t really work. If you cut your rate, your premiums go down. You want to raise premiums, you got to do a whole lot more new business at lower levels of profit, just to get back to where you were.","So the simple arithmetic of taking a lower rate on a large book in the hope of driving revenue synergies is often a fool\u2019s errand. Now it isn\u2019t always. Some people can do perhaps elegantly, but there haven\u2019t been too many of them. So I suspect that the market will continue to think about interest rates and weather and the cost of capital and all of it seems to be incorporating as it prices its product with an unknown cost of goods sold. I don\u2019t expect a lot of change. Could be dead wrong, but that\u2019s one person\u2019s view.","Josh Stirling","That\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s helpful. If I could honestly ask a sort of similar question, but at the other end of the spectrum? So six months or so ago, one of your big mono line competitors in the auto side, announced a deal to get into the homeowners\u2019 insurance business. Obviously it\u2019s probably not material yet, maybe won\u2019t be for some time. But this is a big business for you guys, the source of margins, and it\u2019s been a place you\u2019ve really invested to build a franchise.","But I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s some risk here? Either from losing some of the value you have with agents, from having the bundled offering and the market share that you do. Or I believe you guys distribute a lot with some other \u2013 or at least one or two other direct insurance companies, and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a risk that you would lose some of the business, if it becomes sort of popular to bring the homeowners business back in-house?","Doreen Spadorcia","This is Doreen. I\u2019ll answer your question. We\u2019ve, as we\u2019ve stated before, our business strategy is based on account business and overall service to consumers. To the extent that a certain company has acquired a homeowners\u2019 capability, we think that\u2019s probably a good thing for them. If we were looking at it, it\u2019s smart, but it\u2019s a start-up. It\u2019s very small. And I think you heard Brian\u2019s or Jay\u2019s points in the beginning that we\u2019re the number one homeowners franchise with independent agents. We don\u2019t take that for granted. We\u2019re going to be very, very aggressive about maintaining that position. And so, while I think it\u2019s an interesting twist to things, I think it more validates what our view is about the importance of the product to the customer.","Jay Fishman","I would add one other \u2013 this is Jay Fishman. I would add one other point. We really like the homeowners business.","Doreen Spadorcia","Yeah.","Jay Fishman","We really do. We are not in it reluctantly, quite the contrary. The record that we\u2019ve posted there is really remarkable. I think if you look over the past now even 11 and 12 years, it was one year we had a combined ratio in the homeowners business in excess of 100 and that was actually 2011. It was Tuscaloosa, and it was Joplin, and it was Irene. Other than that, we\u2019ve been sub-400 every year and \u2013 so we\u2019re in it because we like it and we think we are real good at it. So, it\u2019s okay, we will keep going.","Josh Stirling","Okay. Thanks, guys. They\u2019re probably 10 years late. So we\u2019ll check back in 5.","Jay Fishman","It\u2019s okay, we were 10 years late on direct. So we\u2019ll trade them.","Josh Stirling","That\u2019s fair. Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ryan Tunis","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess my first question is just for Jay. I guess Travelers has probably more experience than any other company in integrating large companies or large P&C companies over the last two decades, you know it is obviously a dealer specific question, but in what ways do you see it easier or harder to integrate a large company today versus 8, 10 years ago either from cost save standpoint revenue synergy any of that type of stuff?","[Audio Gap]","Jay Fishman","These are hard to do, they are hard from the human side of the news. People get concerned about their jobs, their families, their positions all legitimate concerns and lots of really good talented people and it\u2019s hard, the people side of this is a very, very hard thing to do; and that\u2019s kind of my experience. I never rely too much on revenue synergies, I used to worry a lot about revenue loss. Our goal was to keep it intact, if we thought if we could keep it intact we were actually doing pretty good given some of the pressures that emerge from it. So, synergies I have absolutely no idea, yes it\u2019s hard tough job.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.","Jay Cohen","Yes. A couple of questions. First is will you, in the 10-Q you gave an outlook for 2016 March, I think that\u2019s the first time you did that in the business, kind of the underlying margins and you are suggesting relative stability as you go into 2016, I guess to read into that is a fair to assume you believe pricing will remain relatively stable through at least the first half of next year?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes Jay, it\u2019s Alan. So embedded in that outlook in 2016 we think there will be some improvements in the large losses and the weather. But in terms of pricing, I direct your attention to another part of that outlook where we do talk about renewal premium change. We don't get into a distinction between exposure and price, but we do give you a sense there of relative stability in renewal premium change.","Jay Cohen","That's great. And then maybe a question for Jay Benet, you talk about potential M&A and then you mentioned you will be able to finance it not worry about excess capital and holding on to it, but what kind of leveraged do you think you could deploy if it was a good solid acquisition?","Jay Benet","We operate at the holding company with leverage target of somewhere in the 15% to 25% range, relative to total capital and we\u2019re running a little under 22% at this point in time. That\u2019s consistent with our ratings objective, it\u2019s consistent with the discussions we have with the rating agencies, you know if there was some transaction that caused it to go to the higher end of that target range, I would think the rating agencies would be very comfortable with that, I think, you know if you could probably go a higher, if you had plans to bring it down over a period of time, you know there is some flexibility there, but that\u2019s the general characteristic of a leverage ratio that we think of.","Jay Fishman","I actually agree and I think that you could, of course Jay\u2019s smiling. I was just going to make a little bit different point, I think you can take it somewhat above the limit recognizing that you would not be in the share buyback position for some time, it would not make sense to be out issuing shares and then turn around very quickly and be buying back doesn't make a lot of sense. So, redirection cash flows gives you some leveraged capacity as well.","Jay Cohen","Got it. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney. Please go ahead.","Larry Greenberg","Hi good morning. Thank you. Just a little bit of clarity on the net non-cat weather comments specifically in personal alliance, the year ago non-cat weather if my memory serves me was a bit worse than what you might characterize as normal, so recognizing that this quarter was better than a year ago, was it better than what you would characterize as normal?","Doreen Spadorcia","I think for homeowners it was, for auto it was slightly negative.","Jay Fishman","So, aggregate for this segment.","Doreen Spadorcia","Net positive, but it was a little different by line.","Larry Greenberg","Okay thanks. And then just to talk a little bit about the expense ratios, and I might be microscoping things a little bit too much here, but it looks like in business and personal lines, the expense ratio has been trending a little bit higher this year, I know the year ago first quarter had some unusual worker's comp stuff in it, so that was exaggerated, but adjusted for everything it looks like expense ratios are marginally higher and I guess, I would have thought with Quantum and personal lines and maybe the continued integration of Dominion on business and international that that expense ratios might be trending down at this point, so just wondering if there is any thoughts on that?","Brian MacLean","Larry this is Brian. It is really two different stories, but whilst [ph] Alan do the BI piece and then \u2013 that segment and Doreen can touch on professional lines.","Alan Schnitzer","Sure, let me start with that in the quarter expenses did tick up a little bit and I would caution you that every quarter there is going to be things that sort of come and go. In the expense line this quarter we had a little bit of expenses, I mean technology expenses running through, but I think what I would really point you to is the expense ratio for the first half of the year, if you are looking for what we would consider broadly speaking is sort of a reasonable run rate number, but again I\u2019d put a quarter around that because there is always going to be things that come and go.","Doreen Spadorcia","And I will move to PI for a minute. So you know that we set out to take $140 million of expense out, so that we could price Quantum 2.0 at a competitive level and that was made up of separate pieces, so you won't see everything in the expense line. We had about a third of that from ULAE [ph] a third from commissions and then the third other third was our own operating expense. And I think what we're seeing with some of that not reducing is that we had a higher level of growth in a good way then we had planned, so your acquisition expenses in terms of report ordering and inspections all of that really are upfront cost and we also are having such a good property here that we contributed to our contingent commission. So, I think they are all explainable and I will just say that the things that we've done have allowed us to compete from a new product perspective. So, and just to reiterate, I think we did a reconciliation for you at the end of \u2013 for the fourth quarter and we did achieve the $140 million in savings. It\u2019s just those others\u2026","Jay Fishman","Shows up in the loss.","Doreen Spadorcia","Right.","Jay Fishman","In the loss ratio, not the expense ratio.","Doreen Spadorcia","A big part of it and some was in property and some was in auto.","Larry Greenberg","Okay, great. Thanks. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. So one question here. In looking at your kind of underlying combined ratios, business insurance area, they're pretty profitable, loss cost pretty benign right now, rate activity pretty consistent. I am just curious, why aren't we seeing market share gains out of the Travelers at this point, and what are you doing potentially to pick up some market share? I think that this would be a perfect time to do that, and maybe not so much with price, but maybe with risk appetite as well?","Jay Fishman","Yeah. It\u2019s Jay Fishman. I will turn it over to Alan in a second. But your last line there, I think is right on. We just don\u2019t think that on the margin you can grow market share by trying to fine tune a modest reduction in price. You don\u2019t have a price lift and its individual underwriters with individual agents and individual accounts. And they bring with them every day a philosophy of perspective and we can\u2019t say to them want you to cut price by a 0.5. They wouldn\u2019t understand a 0.5 from what? It wouldn\u2019t make sense. And so the notion of fine tuning pricing to achieve market share gains is an illusion. It just \u2013 we don\u2019t know how to do and I\u2019m not sure anybody else does either.","Now if someone is willing to accept materially lower returns, not only on new benign renewal because it will bleed over. You will begin getting exceptionally aggressive on new business and what you find is that agents will get exceptionally anxious about their old renewal books. And so you can do that, but it will have a really meaningful impact on profitability and we\u2019ve seen plenty of companies do that, grow revenues with meaningfully declining profitability, not a \u2013 we don\u2019t think a successful strategy. So we focus on product, we focus on people, we focus on technology, we focus on doing making it easier to do business with agents, as growing our market share.","So if you look at our middle market business over the last and I\u2019m really going from memory here \u2013 over the last I think 10 years, middle market went from $2.2 billion in premium to $3.2 billion in premium. That\u2019s a substantial growth in that segment as we did that. Now, we\u2019ve had other segments that have shrunk and they\u2019ve shrunk to some extent intentionally. When we hit the financial crisis, we took a very hard look at our surety business and our management liability businesses and we had some because we didn\u2019t do everything perfect.","I think about our attempt to raise rates in Quantum, pre-Quantum 2.0. So it\u2019s a very granular analysis and I\u2019ll actually direct you to the Investor Day presentation that we did I\u2019m going to say two years ago, where we presented an analysis of individual lines of business and how they had grown and others and how they had shrunk. So we are always interested in growing. We are just interested in growing in ways that are intelligent and actually create value overtime and we work at that relentlessly.","Alan, if you want to chime in.","Alan Schnitzer","Not much to add. I guess I would point to things like moving Marc Schmittlein to over to take on the cyber project. That\u2019s an example of something we see as a real potential opportunity and when we find those opportunities and we do spent a lot of time looking for and we will make every effort to try to make hay out of it.","Brian Meredith","Right. I guess, maybe where I was trying to go with this, Jay, a little bit is, is it at this point where we are in the cycle, and pricing stuff an appropriate time to maybe dip down in the E&S markets, in areas that maybe are on the borderline standard E&S, and try to get a little bit more risk appetite from that perspective, given where loss trend is right now?","Jay Fishman","So first, Fred is encouraging me to say, I said middle market in numbers I gave you which are actually commercial accounts. So that $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion, so the record is correct in that regard. The notion of the E&S market as a separate distinguished risk pool is just something that we struggle with a little bit. We are always trying to push our risk appetite out. I think about what Marc Schmittlein did in Select as he broadened the profile of the business that we were trying to do. I think about what \u2013 I think about what we also did in commercial accounts as we broadened out the programs and products there.","E&S market, what Alan speak to that more directly, but it\u2019s always trying to push our risk profile comfortably and when you don\u2019t push it comfortably, you don\u2019t bring knowledge, you get bad results. Right?","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah, I agree, we will push ourselves on a risk profile, but we will be steadfast on their return focus. So whether it\u2019s E&S or anything else, we are certainly looking for the opportunities.","Brian Meredith","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Okay. And this will be our last question please.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Charles Sebaski","Good morning. Thank you. First question is on the personal business and the Quantum 2.0. Can you give us any additional color on how much of the book now has kind of filtered through from Quantum 2.0, and what effect that could have as it kind of expands through going forward?","Doreen Spadorcia","This is Doreen, and I'll tell you there's certain things we don't normally disclose. But I will tell you, and we've said this in the past, that over 90% of our new business is now coming from Quantum 2.0. Since inception, we've now got a pretty big chunk of premium, and we\u2019ve got enough earned premium that we think there's enough credibility for us to really look at the performance of the business. And I'll tell you that it's right within our expectations of how we thought it was going to perform.","Jay Fishman","And the only \u2013 the reason it\u2019s not a 100% is because there are some states..","Doreen Spadorcia","Exactly.","Jay Fishman","That simply don\u2019t allow Quantum 2.0 as a model. So we are\u2026","Charles Sebaski","What states would those be?","Doreen Spadorcia","Well, I'll tell you, we just rolled out California and Massachusetts. It's a new product, but it's not Quantum. And we've got a few other states, North Carolina, we have to build something separately for that. But even in California and Massachusetts, which we were happy to bring them a new product because they didn't even get Quantum 1, it's a light version in terms of what the regulators allow us.","Jay Fishman","And that\u2019s largely because of the inability to use credit.","Doreen Spadorcia","Credit, that\u2019s right.","Jay Fishman","As a upfront underwriting evaluator and pricer in those states.","Doreen Spadorcia","Right.","Charles Sebaski","Thank you. Sorry, didn\u2019t mean to cut you off. One additional question, I guess final, on the M&A and the consolidation front, and how you guys think of opportunities for growth internationally relative to the U.S.? If I look at your book and the market share, market share position leaders that you have in a lot, and the recent transactions with Dominion or South America, do you feel that the book or your business is more conducive to international opportunities? And how do you weigh that on a longer term perspective, given the need for return profile, and the other things you\u2019ve previously outlined?","Alan Schnitzer","Charles, it\u2019s Alan, let me start with that and maybe Jay will follow-up. We certainly apply the same standards outside the United States as we do inside the United States. So the question is always, is the transaction going to contribute to our ability to create shareholder value overtime? So, same lens for evaluating all of it.","Given our profile in the United States, given the market share of the franchises we have, that same analysis might apply differently outside the United States where there is just more GDP that we are not currently accessing. So we like the opportunity in Brazil long term, we like the transaction in Canada with the Dominion and we will continue as we\u2019ve been on this journey to export our competitive advantages from the U.S. to other markets.","We will continue to build on a platform that\u2019s scalable and as we find those opportunities, we will again make every effort to complete those transactions. But \u2013 so we are certainly out looking for them and it\u2019s the exact same standard we would apply to transact in the U.S.","Jay Fishman","And I\u2019d just add one comment because we\u2019d take it for granted, sometimes you all forget. We are not a Fortune 100 or 200 guaranteed cost casualty underwriter. We\u2019re not a liability writer broadly, general liability, to what we would call global companies. So when we talk about outside U.S., we are talking about local business. This is now Brazilian companies or Canadian companies. We\u2019re very focused on the local environment. So, where the local environment has characteristics that would allow for either another competitor to come in and succeed or an acquisition opportunity where that local environment holds promise. We are ambitious for that. No issue at all. But it is a very local evaluation, not an evaluation of kind of the global insurance market.","Charles Sebaski","And does your product portfolio and how you analyze the business within the U.S. lend itself to being able to do that internationally in the same way, I mean, do you get the same access to information and underwriting ability or are there difference that have, I guess, held you back from expanding more broadly or rapidly internationally?","Jay Fishman","There are certainly differences between marketplaces, but we think our fundamental approach to the business being disciplined about returns, being strong underwriters, all those cultural attributes do translate. And we think that given the sophistication we have in this marketplace, there\u2019s opportunities for us to deploy that sophistication in other less sophisticated markets and make a difference. But there are definitely differences market to market. I wouldn\u2019t say that necessarily holds us back, but it is one of the things that we assess and evaluate.","But I would also observe that there are differences in the United States. Doreen just talked about our Quantum product and how we\u2019ve got to tailor that to different markets in the U.S. and we really take that same skill set of assessing our competitive advantages and figuring out how to deploy them in markets around the world. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done in our existing footprint and that\u2019s what we will continue to do whether it\u2019s in that footprint or in new geographies.","Charles Sebaski","Thank you very much for the answers.","Jay Fishman","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Very good. This concludes our call for today. Thank you very much for joining us and we apologize for the disruption. We apologize for those we didn\u2019t get to in the queue, and we are available in Investor Relations to take your calls for the rest of the day.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 19, 2017.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our third quarter 2017 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.","Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, Chief Operating Officer.

Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that available in the Investors section on our website travelers.com.","And now, Alan Schnitzer.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $293 million or $1.05 per diluted share and core income of $253 million or $0.91 per diluted share.","The fact that we made a considerable profit in one of the costliest hurricane seasons on record demonstrates the earning power of our franchise which is built on strong foundation of underwriting and investment expertise.","This is reflected in our manageable catastrophe losses, underlying underwriting gain of $292 million and after-tax net investment income of $457 million.","Our catastrophe losses were well within what we would expect from the events in the quarter. Balancing risk and reward to generate leading results over time is in our DNA. While that's evident in our results this quarter, our underwriting discipline would have been even more evident if Hurricane Irma had taken the track to Miami up the East Coast of Florida which was projected just 48 hours before landfall.","Notwithstanding 10 years of relatively moderate Atlantic storm activity, our investors should know we were well positioned for the very realty possibility of $150 billion industry event. That's not to say we'll never have a substantial or even an outsized loss from an event, its just to say that balancing risk and reward is always front and center for us.","Our catastrophe underwriting also incorporates lessons learned over the years from events like hurricane Katrina and superstorm Sandy. Those lessons are reflected in our disciplined approach to terms and conditions which make outcomes more predictable, risk control initiatives, which make a difference in risk mitigation, selection, and pricing, and proprietary flood underwriting down to the address level.","Our experience with the storms this quarter also reaffirms the competitive advantage in our claim model in terms of the value it delivers to our customers and agents and for our shareholders.","Through military-like logistics capabilities and a sophisticated cross-training strategy, we have the capacity to conduct and we did conduct virtually 100% of our claim inspections for hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria with Travelers employees and that would have been the case even if Irma had taken that East Coast of Florida track, and even in that scenario our flexible model would have given us capacity to spare.","As compared to an independent adjuster, we\u2019re confident that a highly trained and committed Travelers claim professional produces a better experience for our customers and a much more efficient outcome for us. To that point, we were successful this hurricane season in meeting our objective of having the vast majority of our property claims closed within 30 days of the event.","Our response to the storms also included our largest deployment of our drilling fleet to date. We conducted more than a thousand inspections with drones, which significantly accelerates the speed and reduces the cost of handling those claims. Again, a better outcome for our customers and more efficient outcome for us.","We own and operate all of our drones and we're on track to have more than 650 drones in regular operation around the country by the middle of next year.","Moving beyond catastrophes, we are very pleased with the underlying performance of our businesses. In Business Insurance, the underlying combined ratio of 96.4 was solid, particularly in light of a high level of non-cat fire related losses. To a large degree we believe it was normal period to period volatility.","Bond & Specialty Insurance produced another impressive quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 77.7. In Personal Insurance, the underlying results reflect loss trends within expectations, the continued success of the pricing and underwriting actions we began implementing in our auto business a year ago and the successful performance of our Property business.","Notably, our consolidated expense ratio has improved 90 basis points year-to-date. The result is maintaining expense discipline, while investing strategically. For example, in Personal Insurance, over the last few years we've invested in product and marketing initiatives, platform improvements and distribution management, resulting in significant net written premium growth.","In Business Insurance, we're investing in technology and enhancing work flow to be a better partner for our agents and brokers, deliver compelling value for our customers and improve our operating efficiency. We've made those investments on about flat G&A expense dollars. We're looking forward to sharing more about these initiatives with you at our Investor Day next month.","Turning to the top line, we were very pleased with the success of our marketplace strategies, which resulted in 4% net written premium growth to a record $6.7 billion. Across our commercial businesses, we continue to be successful in achieving historically high retention rates, positive renewal premium change and an increase in new business.","In business units accounting for around two-thirds of our business insurance premium, pure rate change in the quarter was higher both year-over-year and sequentially. In our personal auto business, our execution was spot on plan and we were again pleased to see continued momentum in our industry-leading homeowners business.","There's been no lack of speculation around the outlook for pricing in the wake of an unprecedented hurricane season which still has six weeks to go and in the midst of an ongoing unprecedented wildfire season in California. Big events impact pricing when a material amount of industry surpluses eroded and\/or when the events change the markets view of risk. It's not hard to make the argument that we've experienced both.","By some estimates 10% or more of industry surplus and counting. The first time more than 1 Category 4 hurricane has made landfall on the U.S. mainland in one season. As devastating as it was, a very close call with Irma, and in the fourth quarter, forest fires that are burning not in forests but in subdivisions, and that's not to mention two earthquakes in Mexico and a cyber event impacting more than 140 million U.S. consumers. And while those events have understandably captured everyone's attention that's only part of the story.","Interest rates remain at historically low levels. Loss trend has outpaced rate and exposure for a few years now to a degree that many others in the industry are probably not earning their cost of capital. And insured losses from PCS cat events in each of the last four quarters have exceeded the 10 year average for that quarter.","I can't predict what the market is going to do, but I will share with you what we're planning to do. As a component of our strategy to manage all the levers available to us to meet our return objectives, for more than a year now we've been discussing our efforts to improve renewal rate change and for more than a year now we've been making incremental but steady progress.","The circumstances I've just described strengthen our resolve. We'll seek rate thoughtfully and in close coordination with our distribution partners and in that regard we believe our customers are well served by a stable and predictable market that keeps pace with inflation, as opposed to the higher pricing swings of the past.","Two final comments before I pass the microphone to Jay. First, I want to add my voice in support of the corporate tax reform efforts in Washington. As a country, addressing the corporate tax rate is important for enabling U.S. businesses to compete more effectively at home and abroad against our foreign counterparts.","Beyond just the tax rate, we were particularly pleased to see that the big six framework for tax reform promotes levelling the playing field between U.S. and foreign companies. In addition to contributing to the country's tax base, it's important in addressing the decades-long streak of U.S. based Companies losing U.S. market share and American jobs to offshore companies. Case in point, a $2.5 billion transaction announced just yesterday.","Finally I'd like to thank our claim organization for an extraordinary effort over these past few months. They've certainly risen to the occasion. It's an understatement to say that events like Harvey, Irma, and Maria and others that have been in the news are devastating and our thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been impacted.","Events like those serve as reminders that in the end we sell a promise. We work hard to make sure that our agents and brokers are proud to sell that promise and that at every opportunity we demonstrate the value of that promise to our customers who buy it.","And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay Benet","Thanks, Alan. Core income was $253 million down from $701 million in the prior-year quarter and core ROE was 4.5% down from 12.5%. As in the first half of the year, these reductions in core income and core ROE were not driven by fundamental changes in our underlying performance, rather they were reflective of the high level of cat activity this quarter.","Beginning with underwriting results, our underlying underwriting gain remained strong, as evidenced by our 92.8% underlying combined ratio which was 0.7 points higher than the prior-year quarter. This slight increase was primarily due to a relatively high level of non-cat fire related losses in Business Insurance this quarter.","Catastrophe losses were $455 million after-tax compared to only $58 million in the prior-year quarter. This increase of $397 million was driven by estimated losses from Hurricane Harvey of $319 million pre-tax or $207 million after-tax. Hurricane Irma of $242 million pre-tax or $157 million after-tax, and Hurricane Maria of $82 million pre-tax or $54 million after-tax.","Net favourable prior-year reserve development which I'll discuss in more detail shortly was $10 million after-tax down from $27 million in the prior-year quarter. Net investment income of $457 million after-tax continued to be strong, although down $15 million from the prior-year quarter.","Fixed income NII as anticipated was lower by $20 million after-tax due to the continued low interest rate environment, while non-fixed income NII increased by $5 million after-tax due to the strong private equity returns.","Interestingly, when we look at the long-term bonds we hold that are maturing through the end of next year, along with growth in the size of our fixed income portfolio and higher short term interest rates, our outlook for after-tax fixed income NII during the remainder of 2017 and into 2018 is only slightly lower, $10 million or less quarter-over-quarter, as compared to the corresponding quarters in 2016 and 2017, an improvement from what we've been experiencing in recent years.","Consolidated net favourable prior-year reserve development was $15 million pre-tax compared to $39 million in the prior-year quarter. Business Insurances net favourable reserve development was $9 million pre-tax compared to $4 million in the prior-year quarter, including an increase to asbestos reserves of $225 million pre-tax, the same amount as in the prior year quarter.","Excluding the asbestos reserve increase, BI\u2019s net favourable reserve development was $234 million pre-tax, primarily driven by better-than-expected loss experience in domestic workers comp and GL, partially offset by higher-than-expected loss experience in domestic commercial auto.","As has been the case in recent years, the asbestos reserve increase which related to a broad number of policyholders was driven by higher estimates for projected settlement and defense costs for mesothelioma claims than we had previously assumed.","Notwithstanding these higher cost estimates, the underlying asbestos environment remained essentially unchanged from recent periods, as compared to our expectation that the environment would improve.","As you may recall, the current asbestos environment, which has continued to result in periodic reserve strengthening for us and the industry is still much improved from the high severity environment of 10 to 15 years ago when risks from pre packaged bankruptcies, direct actions filed against insurers, and products, non-products coverage litigation among others led to very expensive settlement activity and a high degree of uncertainty in terns of the outlook.","The asbestos environment and more recent years has been frequency driven, the result of people developing mesothelioma and unfortunately dying soon thereafter. Interestingly the most recent data from the Center for Disease Control which we've included on Page 19 of the webcast shows deaths from mesothelioma in 2015 the most recent data available was 7.5% lower than in 2014, and importantly, the age distribution of these deaths has shifted towards higher age groups, possibly due to more people who work with asbestos prior to the mid to late 70s, the high usage years, \"living into the disease.\"","What that means is that recent medical advances that have successfully treated a variety of other deadly diseases seem to have enabled more people in this highly exposed cohort to live well into their 70s and 80s and then develop and die from mesothelioma. As nature takes its course this high risk cohort will get smaller over time and accordingly we continue to expect the currently high frequency claim environment to improve over time.","Bond & Specialties net favourable development was $6 million pre-tax compared to $46 million in the prior-year quarter, while Personal Insurance had no reserve development compared to $11 million of unfavourable development in the prior-year quarter.","Excluding A&E, year-to-date on a combined stat schedule P-basis for all of our subsidiaries all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate developed favourably and other than some modest reserve strengthening for commercial auto, all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favourably or had de minimis unfavourable development.","Operating cash flows of over $1.6 billion was very strong and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of almost $2 billion, up from $1.7 billion at the beginning of the year. This higher than normal level of holding company liquidity provides funding for our $450 million of senior notes that mature in December.","All of our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, net unrealized gains were $1.5 billion pre-tax or a $1 billion after-tax, up from $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion respectively at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $86.73 and adjusted book value per share of $83.06 increased over 4% and 3% respectively from the beginning of the year.","Despite the high level of cat losses, we returned $528 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $200 million and share repurchases of $328 million bringing total capital return to shareholders to $1.68 billion year-to-date.","As we've stated for many years and repeated in this quarters 10-Q, the timing and actual number of shares we will purchase in the future will depend on earnings among a variety of other factors, so consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we're keeping our eyes on the California wildfires, which we expect will be a significant cat for us as we evaluate share repurchase activity for the fourth quarter.","With that let me turn the microphone over to Brian.","Brian MacLean","Thanks, Jay. Starting with this quarter's results in Business Insurance, segment income of $105 million and the combined ratio of 109.8% were both impacted by the significant catastrophe events in the quarter.","The underlying combined ratio of 96.4% was 2.3 points higher than the third quarter of 2016 with the underlying loss ratio increasing 3.4 points. The quarterly loss ratio was impacted by an unusually high number of large non-cat property, primarily fire losses and so the year-to-date results are better indication of how the business is performing.","On the year-to-date basis the underlying loss ratio is up 1.7 points, 70 basis points of which is due to the large loss volatility I just mentioned, with the remaining about a point driven by loss trend in excessive earned pricing.","For the quarter, the underlying expense ratio decreased 1.1 points year-over-year. As with the loss ratio, there are normal fluctuations impacting the quarterly comparison. The year-to-date decline of about a 0.5 is a better indication of our current run rate with the decline driven by both growing earned premium and slightly lower G&A expense dollars.","Net written premiums of $3.4 billion for the quarter were up more than a point year-over-year with domestic net written premiums up about 2% driven by strong production results in middle market.","International net written premiums were down 3% driven by reinsurance reinstatement premiums related to the cats that occurred in the quarter. Excluding the impact of reinstatement international was up 1%.","Turning to domestic production. We were pleased that retention for the quarter of 85% remained at a historically high level. Renewal premium change was strong at about three points in the quarter with rate change that was up slightly from last quarter and up a half a point from a year ago. New business of $434 million was up 6% versus the prior-year.","Looking at the individual businesses, I'll begin with Select, where production statistics remained strong, with retention for the quarter of 83%, renewal premium change was nearly five points, while new business premiums of $98 million were up 4% year-over-year.","In middle market our results reflect consistent performance in the marketplace as demonstrated by another quarter of strong retention at 87%. Renewal premium change of three points was down slightly from the second quarter due to lower exposure growth, while rate increases of nearly a point were up year-on-year and in line with the second quarter.","New business of $267 million was up 12% versus the prior-year quarter. We attribute a large portion of this to great execution in the market by our field organization, particularly as it relates to larger accounts in industry segments that we like.","We're also encouraged by how our investments in technology are enabling our underwriters to be more active in the market, we'll talk more about that at our upcoming Investor Day.","So all-in quarter that was significantly impacted by the weather and we were pleased with our execution in the marketplace. Our fundamental marketplace strategy remains unchanged. We seek to retain our best performing business, while thoughtfully managing the profitability of the book.","Importantly, the market and environmental circumstances that Alan outlined earlier further support our ability to successfully execute on this strategy.","I'll now turn to Bond & Specialty insurance where segment income for the quarter was strong at $136 million though down somewhat from the prior year quarter due to a lower level of net favourable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio improved nearly a point from the prior year quarter to under 78%.","As to the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were up 2% reflecting growth in both our domestic management liability and international businesses, with the international growth driven by strong production in both our Canadian surety and UK management liability businesses.","Turning to production in our domestic management liability businesses, we ","continue to execute our strategy of growing our profitable portfolio by retaining our best performing accounts and writing new business in return adequate product segments. So we couldn't be more pleased that retention came in at a record high of 89% for the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of 88% or better, while new business was up slightly from the third quarter of last year.","Renewal premium change of 3.5 points was up slightly from the second quarter due to a modest increase in exposure growth. So Bond & Specialty results remain terrific and we continue to feel great about the segments performance and our market positions.","Turning to Personal Insurance. Net written premiums for the segment grew 9% in the quarter with more than half of that growth coming from higher pricing. Despite 8.7 points of catastrophe losses in the quarter, Personal Insurance generated $77 million of segment income with a third quarter combined ratio of 99.7%. The underlying combined ratio of 91% improved about 1.5 point\u2019s year-over-year.","The domestic agency auto combined ratio for the quarter was 106% and included 7.2 points of cat losses, far above our normal third quarter auto cat load expectation of about a 0.5. Compared to the third quarter of 2016, the underlying combined ratio is down 2.3 points.","As you can see on page 15 of the webcast, 1.3 points of the decrease is due to continued improvement in the expense ratio, as we leverage a consistent level of operating expenses over a larger premium base.","The remaining point of decrease is primarily due to the fact that the third quarter of 2016 loss ratio included the year-to-date impact of the bodily injury severity reestimation.","As we discussed in previous calls, in response to higher bodily injury loss levels, we are taking actions to improve profitability, most notably by improving the pricing of the book. As a result, renewal premium change increased from 7.9% in the second quarter to 9.5% in the third quarter reaching 10.5% for the month of September.","We expect that renewal premium change will remain in double-digits for the fourth quarter and as we told you previously, by year-end we will have obtained enough rate on a written basis to address the elevated bodily injury loss levels.","Retention declined modestly in the quarter as expected, but remained strong by historical standards even as we implement meaningful price increases through the book.","This growth has decelerated but remain positive driven by lower levels of new business. Importantly, we remain on track to achieving the goals we laid out for the auto book back in January.","Turning to agency homeowners and other, the combined ratio of 90.3% for the quarter reflects 12.2 points of cat losses. The underlying combined ratio of 78.1% was in line with the quarter, third quarter of 2016, as net trend was offset by the impact of volume on the expense ratio.","Homeowners net written premiums increased 5% in the quarter, somewhat accelerating the momentum we had experienced in recent quarters. As a reminder, we have made a concerted effort to generate growth in this profitable line even as we moderate the growth in auto.","Process and technology improvements have made it easier for agents and brokers to do business with us and we have focused on adding more property oriented distribution partners and increasing our average number of policies per customer.","Overall in Personal Insurance, setting aside the significant impact of catastrophe losses in the quarter, both the agency auto and homeowners results were in line with our expectations and both lines continued to make good progress towards the goals we laid out at the end of last year.","So stepping back and looking across the franchise, while the headline for the quarter is obviously the cats, we feel very good about our underlying results. Considering our significant competitive advantages, the investments that we're making to extend them and to develop additional advantages and our ability to execute, we believe each of our businesses is positioned for continued success.","With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. We're now ready to open it up to Q&A and if I can ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Kai Pan","Thank you, and good morning. My first question is on the outlook for the core combined ratio for the Business Insurance segments. In your 10-Q, you said broadly consistent into 2018. Could you add like what pass through as sort of component of it in terms of your sort of loss \u2013 core loss ratio deterioration and also potential normalization of non-cat losses, as well as the improvements in expense ratio and does your forecast including like a probably better pricing outlook?","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah, Kai. Good morning, it's Alan. Thanks for the question. Let me start with it. We're going to try not to in the outlook try to break this down between the components of loss and expense. We give you a sense as best we can looking at our crystal ball which is never perfect and the world is never going to turn out exactly as we thought, but we try to give you as good a sense as we can on the overall profitability by segment.","In terms of the rate in particular, you can see the written rate that we've been getting and obviously you can see for example, in BI, quarter-over-quarter, and so that will of course earn in and that will be a component of what gets reflected in our outlook, as will the impact of the expense ratio that you see in the nine months, but we're going to try not to break it down between the loss and expense ratio component.","Kai Pan","Okay. My follow-up question on reserves, there are actually two components to that, one is on asbestos, you've been taking charge of about $200 million a year for many years that we know and so why don't you take a big charge upfront or are you considering reinsurance transaction?","The commercial auto site was driven that and is that - like has that - do you pick up that like increase your like current year, accident year loss pick on the commercial auto line as well? Thanks.","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah, let me start with the auto side and then I'll ask Jay Benet to comment on the reserves. On the auto, we've been seeing and talking about some severity on the commercial auto side for some time and we've been addressing it.","We view this as a tweak to those reserves in prior year periods and you know, think about it's $40 billion reserve increase on a couple of $2 billion or $3 billion reserve base, $2 billion or $3 billion reserve base. So we look at that and we don't over react to it. It's just the normal process of every quarter we go through and we look at our reserves and look at the trends and the cases we've got out there and true it up. So it's not anything that has to any significant degree impacted our view of loss trend or what's happening in the current year period. Jay, do you want to address the asbestos?","Jay Benet","Yes, thanks. As it relates to the asbestos like every other reserve we take our best shot looking at all of the data we have available at points in time to evaluate what the reserve should be, and as part of that, we're making assumptions as to what the future looks like with regard to the level of activity that it will take place in terms of meso deaths and also look at what kind of settlement costs or litigation costs we face, and come up with as I said our best estimate, and what's been taking place over the last several years, as we said in our description of the environment is the environment really hasn't changed very much, but the assumptions we've made that possibly would lead to a fall off in the amount of activity just haven't borne out.","So there\u2019s nothing about our reserve increase that reflects a dramatically changing environment and we thought we\u2019d add some color to it this quarter with regard to this page we added to the webcast as it relates to what's been taking place in the various cohorts associated with mesothelioma deaths and we'll see what happens in the future. But as it relates to making any change in process or whatever we didn't think that was appropriate.","Alan Schnitzer","And Kai, as it relates to the reinsurance you asked that as well. We certainly try to evaluate as best we can from the outside every deal we see announced by others and we are talking to the same people that are on the other side of those transactions evaluating them for us.","So no lack of analysis on our end or looking into it. If we found a deal that we thought really made a difference from an economic perspective we would certainly be interested that.","We certainly see transactions that provide some limited duration benefit in terms of the GAAP accounting, but when we look at it from an economic basis and get down to the cash flows, we just haven't seen one yet that makes sense for us.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed.","Jay Gelb","Thanks and good morning. I was hoping to touch base on the Business Insurance outlook for commercial insurance pricing. Alan, I believe in your commentary, you talked about seeking thoughtful rate increases in conjunction with your distribution partners, and keeping pricing ahead of loss cost inflation.","Given all of the factors that we've seen driving up large losses in the current quarter and into 4Q, can you talk a little bit more in terms of the outlook there?","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah. We've been saying for some time Jay that for over a year now as we look at our book and we look down the road out at the horizon that we're going to need to improve written rate to meet our return objectives as part of our overall strategy and we've been doing that for some time and you can see we've had some incremental but steady success in it.","And when we look at the factors, when we look at the weather we had in the third quarter, when we look at some of the other things going on in the world, that's what's captured everyone's attention. I actually don't think that's the bigger part of the story.","I think the bigger part of the story are the underlying dynamics that are driving the overall margins and profitability in this business. And when we look at that and we look at the accounts that we have, we say that it's time to move a little bit.","We're not executing towards a headline number. You take all our accounts and we take all our accounts and we segment them very thoughtfully and for some time we've been getting rate in excessive loss trend on the accounts that are most returned challenge for us and we're getting to a point where our need to get rate is sort of extending up the continuum and that's reflected in the fact that this quarter we got rate on the higher percentage of our accounts than we did last quarter and the quarter before that et cetera, et cetera and its been our intention to lead into that.","And the events of this quarter and the overall circumstances that I've described caused us to say that we're going to lien into it a little bit more and we feel a little bit more confident in our ability to achieve it.","Jay Gelb","Makes sense. Thanks. And then my follow-up is on personal auto. The underlying combined ratio for auto was \u2013 it was improved to around a 99% and I believe last quarter, the company was talking about kind of a longer term target of 96% to 98% plus some 10 year impact. Clearly, you're getting closer there. How soon before you think we can get into the range?","Michael Klein","Hey, Jay. This is Michael Klein from Personal Insurance. Thanks for the question. And first, thanks for noticing that the underlying combined ratio was below a hundred and actually improved year-on-year. That's actually the first time in a while that that's been the case.","Brian gave the main drivers of the quarter-over-quarter change. I think to your question, you know what's the longer term outlook, we think really, there are two or three really key questions there.","One is when are we in terms of pricing, where are we in terms of pricing for the increased bodily injury loss estimates that we recognized in the back half of last year.","The second is 10 year playing out the way we anticipated and the third really is you know, at the core of your question what's our outlook for personal auto profitability and I'll just take those three real quickly in turn.","Brian did mention we'll have achieved enough rate on our written basis by the end of 2017 to cover the increased level of bodily injury losses. That's on a written basis, so on an earned basis we remain on track to have done that by the end of \u201818 which is consistent with that 18 to 24 month timeframe that we laid out at the beginning of the year.","With respect to 10 year, just a couple comments. One, it's important to note that the reason we spiked that out initially was that it had an outsized impact on these kind of period to period comparisons due to the elevated levels of new business that we were writing.","As we've talked about the impact of 10 year from one period to the next, the delta that it drives dissipates as new business levels return to normal and as the portfolio matures, which is what's begun to happen in 2017.","So from this point forward, 10 year becomes less of an anomaly quarter-over-quarter and just one of many factors that you need to think about as you look at our results. I think what's most important to takeaway this quarter as respect to personal auto as we have begun to turn the corner on profitability.","Earned rate is exceeding loss trend and it's combining with underwriting and process changes, growth and expense ratio reduction to drive that improving underlying profitability that you see.","As noted in our outlook, we expect underlying profitability and agency auto to improve over the next four quarters relative to the comparable prior periods. I would remind you given we're going into the fourth quarter that fourth quarter is a relatively high combined ratio period from a seasonality perspective, so you've got to sort of factor that into your overall evaluations.","But at the end of the day, we feel good about the progress we're making towards our target combined ratio and that progress will continue through 2018 and into 2019.","Jay Gelb","Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR. Please proceed.","Randy Binner","Hi, good morning. Thanks. I had a question on the cat losses coming in quite a bit lower particularly with Harvey kind of coming in below the previously guided range. What changed there so dramatically? Did it have to deal with the number of total vehicles or your ability to close claims as you commented earlier in the call? Just trying to get a sense of kind of what improved and how settled the claim activity there is on Harvey and the other hurricanes?","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah, Randy, it's Alan. I'll start and maybe Jay will have something to add, but the only reason that we gave a view on Harvey is because we were speaking at a conference that wasn't FD compliance and we wanted to talk about it at that conference and so we made a disclosure about it.","That was relatively near to the event and so there was a relatively higher degree of uncertainty around our losses at that point, and so the range we gave reflected what we thought and all the information and uncertainty we had at the time, and we've had a significant amount of time elapse from then to now. We've had the opportunity to inspect virtually all of our claims and as I said, the vast majority of our property claims are closed.","Not that there's no uncertainty left, but we feel much better from a certainty perspective and are confident in the number we put up. So I would really say nothing dramatically changed. It was the passage of time that gave us more insight into the losses.","Randy Binner","Well, given that comfort, and would buyback be able to resume maybe earlier than would have been the case if there was more demand surge or other aspects making the tail longer on the claims?","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah, you know, we - in terms of the storms in the third quarter, we ended the third quarter with our balance sheet in very strong shape, so there's nothing from the third quarter where we feel like we've got to build back a capital deficit to any degree at all.","So the fourth quarter will be business as usual in the sense that we'll look at what our earnings are expected to be and we'll consider buybacks accordingly. As Jay said in his prepared remarks, the wildfires are out there. That's an ongoing event that will be significant for us and so we'll evaluate that in our fourth quarter outlook for earnings as we make decisions about buybacks.","Randy Binner","Thank you.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Ryan Tunis","Thanks, good morning, I just had a couple I think for Brian. I guess the first one is if you were to just look at accounts where there were Q3 property losses on the Business Insurance side or maybe those that didn't even have losses but were in loss affected geographies, what's been the conversation I guess so far about with renewals? What's been the magnitude of rate increases or how those conversations have gone? Thanks.","Jay Benet","You know, so and I missed a little bit of the beginning. You said accounts of 32- 3Q, I am sorry, yeah. So, I think it's - some of the stuff is obvious. In the really cat-exposed areas, the conversations are very clear. The perspective on the flood risk, the exposure to the wind, we were reminded once again of what those are, so there's more momentum there.","But I think that it's more what Alan said in his opening. The overall environment of what we've been seeing in property. Two or three years ago we were saying that the line was in very healthy condition and although experiencing some price decreases. ","The largest price decreases we were seeing in the book a couple years ago we thought it was a healthy line and we would manage it. A couple years later that compounding has impacted the core profitability. So we're looking at that.","We're also seeing a little bit of inflation running through the book of business and that is you know in the labor and material side, a number that wouldn't even be big enough to warrant a comment other than the fact that we're beginning to see the line is already under some pressure and the potential for demand surge out of all of the cat activity is making that more dramatic. So a bunch of stuff going on in the line today and we think there's an opportunity to improve the profitability there.","Ryan Tunis","Okay, I guess my follow-up was just thinking about just the potential for further favourable or unfavourable developments in these events. I notice in the Q that the commercial property IBNR looked like it as up about $300 mill quarter-over-quarter.","I guess just as you think about the losses you've reported where do you see the I guess, the greatest potential for uncertainty from here on out? Thanks.","Jay Benet","Any time you have large cats, you're settling claims quickly, but generally, those claims that you're settling are more straightforward ones. So when you look at the level of IBNR, that remains a great deal of uncertainty associated with the cat losses.","So you know, we'll take - we've taken our best shot based on all of the information that we have available and we can't predict whether that will actually be higher or lower than what this will ultimately come out to be. I think we have a good track record of being fairly good at these estimates, but there is a lot of IBNR at this point in time.","Ryan Tunis","Thank you for the answers.","Jay Benet","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed.","Amit Kumar","Thanks and good morning. Two questions if I might. The first question goes back to the discussion on pricing. If I were to take that comment and sort of flip it towards the reinsurance side, how do you expect those discussions with their re-insurers to go? Do you expect to sort of hold the line on pricing based on your outlook or just maybe help us understand that equation a bit better?","Alan Schnitzer","Amit, I don't think we've got a lot of insight to give you on that. Obviously, we'll be thinking about it over the coming weeks and months, and I guess one reason we're not particularly preoccupied by this, we don't buy all that much reinsurance. We're gross line underwriter. We like our underwriting and so we don't buy that much. So on a relative basis we're less impacted by that.","I would hope that our thoughtful underwriting as it was demonstrated in these storms would factor into whatever pricing we negotiate when it comes up, but it's just not something we spend a lot of time running our hands over.","Amit Kumar","Got it. That's a fair comment. Switching back to the discussion on Business Insurance. If you look at the mix of BI, 50% of the book is comp international and GL. Do you think these cat losses give you an ability to enforce some incremental rate action in the non-cat impacted lines or do you think that this somewhat gets relegated to the exposed line set at this juncture?","Alan Schnitzer","You know, Amit, you've got commercial auto on one end of the spectrum, you've got workers comp on the other end of the spectrum and everything else sort of falls in the middle in terms of where it is in terms of rate adequacy.","But what I would tell you though and one of the reasons why in my prepared remarks I was so deliberate about talking not just about the storms that is captured everyone's attention, but about the other underlying factors in the business is those are real.","Things like where interest rates are, things like what weather has done, we've got pricing and loss trend over several years that that impacts all the lines. So we view the - our pricing objectives I should say go beyond the property line, really extend across all our lines and all our geographies. So we're not thinking of this as property-related or coastal related. We're thinking about it much more broadly.","Amit Kumar","Fair point. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, good morning. My first question, I'm just trying to get a feel as we think about flood risk here, obviously a big component of the Harvey loss. How much of flood-related risk came through your commercial lines exposure and as you think about going forward is there an opportunity both on the commercial line side and then also maybe depending upon what happens with the national flood program to potentially write more flood risk both within your commercial and personal lines businesses?","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah, Elyse it's Alan, I'll start and see if Brian has anything to add, but Harvey was by and large a flooding event for us and as it turns out, our underwriting held up and we feel good about it. It's not, you know, we have a pretty good market share in the State and our losses we think are reflected of the fact that we do have proprietary address by address flood underwriting that really stood up to it and so we feel good about it.","Whether there's incremental opportunity, you know, after every one of these big events we take a step back and we think about how we feel about our exposures and how we feel about opportunity and what the lessons learned are from that event and how we apply those to exposure elsewhere.","So we will be going through a post-mortem process and assessing how we feel about our coastal flood exposure and we may look at that and say, boy we could take on a little bit more. We may look at it and say we're just right or we may look at it and say we would like a little bit less and we're in that process, but it could be we find more opportunity there.","On the personal line side, I think that's a much more complicated question and you get into the NFIP. It's really hard to compete with the government program that prices at the discount that it does and as long as there's that program out there, pricing at the discounts at actuarially sound rates, you know, it's not going to be an opportunity for us or anybody.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then my second question, earlier on the call you guys did mention that the California fires would be a significant loss. How do we think through the losses there and the potential business interruption claims from some of the wineries that are obviously very significantly impacted from this event? Any color you can just give there? Thank you.","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah, we're as interested in it as you are. I would say it's early. The event is ongoing, and it's hard for us to give a sense right now, so I'm not sure what else to add there.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you very much.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merill Lynch. Please proceed.","Jay Cohen","Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered. Just one quick follow-up. The elevated fire losses and the Business Insurance segment, can you talk about or quantify what the impact was in the quarter on the loss ratio?","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah, in the quarter, Jay, think around two points.","Jay Cohen","Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you.","Alan Schnitzer","Maybe a tic higher, but two, two and a half something like that.","Jay Cohen","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning. Just following up on the pricing discussion. When you talk about pushing prices to keep pace with loss trends, should we interpret that as Business Insurance renewal rates should move closer to about 2% versus the 1% right now?","Jay Benet","Yeah, you know, well first good morning, Sarah. Thanks for the question. I think that's a broader brush than we think about it. I think what you should takeaway is more than the one you see now.","We talk about loss trend being for and we\u2019d like to get to a point where we've got rate and the component of exposure that behaves like rate offsetting inflation and maybe even improving from there. So - but the other thing I would tell you is we're intent on doing this in a way that is thoughtful and controlled and close partnership with our agents and brokers and doing it in a way that isn't disruptive to our customers and we think that's actually a much better model for them.","So this isn't anything we need to achieve tomorrow or next week or all one fell swoop next quarter. This is going to be a gradual process over time.","Sarah DeWitt","Sure, great. That makes sense. And then just when you say the loss trend being four, is that what you're actually realizing right now or is that what you're booking your reserves at looking at a longer term trend, but I thought maybe more recently its been coming in lower than that?","Jay Benet","Yeah, the four is a broad number and it covers our whole Business Insurance premium base. So obviously, there's variation among the products and businesses within that, and the fact that we've had as much PYD as we've had over recent years suggests that it's come in lower than that.","We don't, in terms of our pricing, expect that that's going to continue forever. We expect that over time loss trend is going to return to a longer term average and so our longer term outlook continues to be four.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great.","Jay Benet","But that's a very broad observation.","Sarah DeWitt","Sure. Thanks for the answers.","Jay Benet","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please proceed.","Meyer Shields","Thanks. Good morning. Is there - let me think, how does the fact that people are living into the asbestos-related diseases impact your thinking about permanent injuries on the worker's compensation side?","Alan Schnitzer","Say that again, Meyer?","Meyer Shields","Okay. So on the asbestos side one of the factors driving the adverse reserve development is the fact that people are living longer, so asbestos-related diseases are manifesting themselves, there are claims associated with them and I'm wondering if people are living longer how is that impacting worker's compensation reserving?","Brian MacLean","So this is Brian. I'll take a shot. So obviously, we are factoring into everything we look at in worker's comp and permanent injuries, lifetime injuries into - we're looking at the actuarial life expectancies and given the injuries that the workers have, what is their life span and no question that advances in medicine in general have extended that period over time.","So I think it's a lot of the same information is - but that's been embedded in our numbers forever, really. We've always looked at it that way, so I don't think there's anything fundamentally new there.","Meyer Shields","Okay. And then one small question I guess. Within BI, there's a $21 million expense for non-insurance G&A. I was wondering if you could talk through, what's going on there, what that is?","Jay Benet","Yeah, what you're saying, we closed the acquisition of Simply Business this quarter, so what you're going to start seeing is the G&A expense is going to be influenced by what's taking place with regard to their expense base, and from the other side of the coin, the other revenue line is where their revenue numbers are getting consolidated, so that will just work its way through our consolidated results going forward.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Is this a good run rate, the $21 million of expenses?","Jay Benet","Well, we acquired them, we closed on the acquisition in August, so it's not quite a full quarter.","Meyer Shields","Okay.","Alan Schnitzer","I'm also not sure that on such a small component that we're necessarily going to give a perspective on a run rate expense versus strategic initiative like that. It's all factored into our outlook and margins for the segment.","Jay Benet","There's also costs associated with the acquisition itself that are flowing through that and so I wouldn't look at it at this point as a run rate, but you can develop it over time. I think ultimately what you'll see is if you look at what's taking place with regard to revenues versus expenses, in total, it's not a big delta.","Meyer Shields","Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.","Jay Benet","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi\u2019","And the will be our last question please.","Operator","Thank you. This question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please proceed.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thank you. First question, I think for Michael. On the personal auto business, is there a way to kind of dissect it where you can give us perspective of how much the improved frequency the industry is seeing that is benefiting you versus what's happening with 10 year and some of the underwriting initiatives that's happening?","Michael Klein","Sure, Brian. I would say as with respect to the industry trend information, we've seen the second quarter ISOFastTrack data taking a look at it. I would make - I think the same comment we typically make about that data which is it's paid data. It's an interesting data point and certainly not complete, but as we look at the ISOFastTrack data, we look at our own trend experience, you know, we think those results are relatively consistent with what we're seeing.","As I mentioned in the earlier questions, sort of dissecting the components, you know, not a lot of change - and I think that I mentioned this, as you think about all of the dimensions underneath the underlying combined ratio there's not really any significant change in any of them this quarter.","Brian Meredith","Okay, great. And then my second question, just curious you mentioned the cyber loss obviously with Equifax, upfront and there's been some others. Any change in kind of your view of the cyber business here as a result of what's going on, what does the market look like now for cyber? Is that becoming a more attractive growth area at this point?","Michael Klein","Yes, stepping back I would say that there's an increasing awareness and consciousness in the mind of the risk manager and whether that's a job description for somebody in a big company or proprietor in a small business. I think there's a greater sense of the need for the product and we think that's a healthy thing and we think to a degree that we'll be there to help solve that problem.","Having said that, we are extraordinarily mindful that it's an emerging risk and there's a lot about it we know and there's a lot about it we don't know and that gets factored into the way we think about the industries we want to write in, the individual risks we want to write, the lines we put out, the reinsurance programs that we have. And so we do think that it will continue to be a growing opportunity and we will continue to be cautious in the way we approach it.","Brian Meredith","Great, thank you.","Michael Klein","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you very much for joining us today, and also we look forward to seeing a number of you at our Investor Day on November 13th. Thank you very much and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.","Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chief Executive Officer; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, Chief Operating Officer.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.","And now, Alan Schnitzer.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $595 million and return on equity of 10%. Core income was $543 million and core return on equity was 9.5%. Our results this quarter were impacted by $262 million of after-tax catastrophe losses as well as significant non-cat weather losses, particularly in personal insurance. This has been an active weather year, with first half after-tax catastrophe losses of $488 million or 6 points on the combined ratio.","To put that in some context, this was our highest level of first half catastrophe losses since 2011. While relatively high, the level of weather losses this quarter and year are within an over time range that we plan and price for. And we are confident that we are appropriately managing our exposures. Putting aside the weather, we were very pleased with the underwriting results in our commercial businesses and the progress we have made in personal insurance. In business insurance, we improved our underlying combined ratio compared to the prior year quarter. We were able to maintain a flat underlying loss ratio year-over-year in part by managing the non-rate levers that we talked to you about from time-to-time. Things like risk selection, mix, segmentation, risk control and claims handling. We also improved our expense ratio by about half a point.","Our Bond & Specialty business delivered another quarter of excellent results with a combined ratio of 68.7%. In personal insurance, the underwriting results in both auto and home for the quarter were significantly impacted by catastrophe and non-cat weather losses. Within personal auto, bodily injury loss trends remained consistent with our expectations and we are on track with the actions we have taken to improve profitability. In terms of our investment results for the quarter, after-tax net investment income increased 6% over the prior year quarter benefiting from strong private equity returns. Our results enabled us to return $676 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $475 million in share repurchases.","Turning to the top line, we were very pleased with the success of our marketplace strategies, which resulted in 5% net written premium growth to a record $6.64 billion. Across our commercial businesses, we continued to be successful in achieving historically high retention levels while also delivering positive and in some cases somewhat higher renewal rate change from recent quarters. In our core middle-market business, we achieved positive renewal rate change on an increasing portion of our portfolio. From a little more than half our accounts in the first quarter of last year to almost 60% in the first quarter of this year to just over 60% in the current quarter. And we did so while simultaneously maintaining retention at a very high 88%.","As you have heard us say many times, our production is a result of deliberate account by account and class by class execution. Our efforts this quarter and over recent quarters reflect the continued low interest rate environment and the fact that rate together with the component of exposure that has the same impact on margins as rates have been below loss trend for a few years now. We will continue to execute to meet our return objectives, including by managing the non-rate letters and by seeking rate increases selectively and thoughtfully.","In Personal Insurance, we continue to improve the profitability in our auto business by implementing the pricing and underwriting actions that we have discussed with you over the last few quarters. We are on track to achieve double-digit renewal premium change on a written basis for the end of the third quarter and loss trend remains consistent with our expectations. Given that progress and the continued growth in our very profitable Homeowners business, we feel good about the trajectory of our personal lines business.","Looking forward across all our businesses, we are engaged strategically to maintain and strengthen our competitive advantages. We are focused on our digital agenda on advancing the way we leverage data on exploring and piloting smart investments and things like AI and robotics on setting the standard in terms of the experience for our customers and distribution partners and as always on being as productive and efficient as possible. So as much as we are relentlessly committed to day-to-day execution we are just as committed to our long-term strategic position. And speaking of our digital agenda, we couldn\u2019t be more excited to welcome Simply Business under the Travelers\u2019 umbrella in the third quarter.","To sum it up, I am pleased and encouraged by execution in the first half of the year. And with our franchise value, strong balance sheet, superior talent and capital management strategy, we remain well-positioned to continue to deliver industry leading results. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay Benet","Thanks, Alan. Core income was $543 million down from $649 million in the prior year quarter. And core ROE was 9.5%, down from 11.6%. As was the case in the first quarter, these reductions in core income and core ROE were not driven by fundamental changes in our performance rather they were reflective of lower net favorable prior year reserve development and another quarter of relatively high levels of cat and non-cat weather activity.","Beginning with underwriting results, net favorable prior year reserve development, which I will discuss in more detail shortly, was $132 million after-tax or $60 million less than the prior year quarter. This decrease was almost entirely in bond and specialty, where net favorable development decreased from a very high amount in the prior year quarter. Cat losses were $262 million after-tax, $40 million higher than the already high $222 million in the prior year quarter. And while remaining strong as evidenced by our 93.5% underlying combined ratio, underlying underwriting gain was lower than the prior year quarter primarily due to two things.","As we had anticipated, the timing impact of personal auto bodily injury loss estimates that were consistent with the higher loss trends that we recognized in the second half of 2016 and normal quarterly fluctuations in non-cat weather. Investment results were once again strong, net investment income of $468 million after-tax, increased by 6% or $26 million as compared to the prior year quarter. Non-fixed income, NII increased by $46 million after-tax due to strong private equity returns, which more than offset the fully anticipated $20 million after-tax decrease in fixed income NII driven by the continued low interest rate environment. Consolidated net favorable prior year reserve development was $203 million pre-tax compared to $288 million in the prior year quarter.","Business Insurance\u2019s net favorable reserve development was $125 million pre-tax, the same as in the prior year quarter and net of the $65 million pre-tax or $42 million after-tax increase to environmental reserves. BI\u2019s favorable development was driven by better than expected loss experience in our domestic businesses for workers\u2019 comp, CMP liability, NGL. Bond & Specialty\u2019s net favorable development was $78 million pre-tax, down from a very high $159 million in the prior year quarter, driven by better than expected loss experience in our domestic management liability business and it was known that prior year reserve development in PI this quarter. On a combined statutory Schedule P basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate develop favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development in the first half of the year.","Operating cash flows of $810 million remain very strong and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $2.6 billion, up from $1.7 billion at the beginning of the year and higher than what we considered to be normal. This $900 million increase driven mostly by the $700 million, up 4% 30-year senior notes that we issued on May 30 allows for the funding of our acquisition of Simply Business expected to close in the third quarter as well as the repayment of our $450 million of senior notes maturing in December. All of our capital ratios were at or better than target levels.","Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $1.6 billion pre-tax or $1 billion after-tax, up from $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion respectively at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $86.46 and adjusted book value per share of $82.71 increased 4% and 3% respectively from the beginning of the year. We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses allowing us to return $676 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $201 million and repurchased $475 million of our common shares consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy. And year-to-date we returned $1.15 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Before turning the mic over to Brian, there is one additional topic I will cover. On Page 19 of the webcast, you can see an update of our cat reinsurance treaties that renewed on July 1. There were no significant changes to these treaties and their cost was modestly lower than last year. As for our one remaining cat bond, which runs through May 2018 it\u2019s attachment point maximum limit were reset as required annually to adjust the modeled expected loss of the layer within a predetermined range. For the year beginning May 16, 2017, we will begin recovering amounts under this cat bond if losses in the covered area for single occurrence reach an initial attachment point of $2.346 billion, up from the previous attachment point of $1.968 billion. The full $300 million of coverage amount is available on a proportional basis until such covered losses reach a maximum of $2.846 billion.","With that, I will turn the microphone over to Brian.","Brian MacLean","Thanks, Jay. Starting with this quarter\u2019s results in Business Insurance, we are pleased with segment income of $429 million and a combined ratio of 96.5%. The underlying combined ratio was 94.8%, down 0.5 point compared to the second quarter of 2016, driven by a lower expense ratio. The decline in the expense ratio resulted from slightly lower expense dollars and growing earned premium.","Turning to the underlying loss ratio, as Alan mentioned earlier, our active management of the non-rate levers along with favorable non-cat weather in Business Insurance contributed to a comparable loss ratio year-over-year. We were especially pleased that we were able to achieve this result in an environment of relatively modest price increases. Net written premiums of $3.5 billion for the quarter were up more than 2% year-over-year, with domestic net written premiums, up about 2% driven by strong production results in select and middle-market. International net written premiums were up 8%, driven by the timing of certain adjustments in the second quarter of 2016.","Turning to domestic production, one of our critical objectives is to retain our high-quality book of business. And accordingly, we were pleased that retention for the quarter of 85% remained at a historically high level. Renewal premium change was 3.5 points in the quarter, up about 1 point from the first quarter due to exposure growth in all lines, most notably in our property lines. Rate change remained consistent with last quarter and up more than 0.5 point from a year ago. We continue to achieve rate gains selectively and thoughtfully and are pleased that improvement in rate from a year ago has come broadly across the portfolio. New business of $491 million was consistent with the prior year quarter.","Looking at the individual businesses, I will begin with Select, where production statistics remain strong, with retention for the quarter of 83%. Renewal premium change was about 5 points while new business premiums of $109 million were up 10% year-over-year. In middle-market, our results reflect consistent performance in the marketplace as demonstrated by another quarter of strong retention at 88%. Renewal premium change of about 3.5 points was up about a point from the first quarter due primarily to increased exposure across all lines and included nearly a point of renewal rate change, up a bit from the first quarter. New business of $294 million was down slightly versus the prior year quarter. So, all-in a good financial result for the segment with continued stability in the marketplace.","I will now turn to Bond & Specialty Insurance, where segment income for the quarter was strong at $163 million. Income was down somewhat from the prior year quarter due to a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio remained very strong 82%. As to the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were up 5% across the segment, with solid growth in our domestic surety and management liability businesses. In international, growth was driven by strong production in our Canadian Surety and UK Management Liability businesses, along with some non-recurring policy and reinsurance timing.","Turning to production in our domestic management liability business, we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best performing accounts, while writing new business in return adequate product segments. So, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased that for the third consecutive quarter, retention came in at a historic high of 88%, while new business was up slightly from the second quarter of last year. Renewal premium change of 3.8 points was down slightly from the first quarter. So, Bond & Specialty results remained terrific and we continue to feel great about the segment\u2019s performance and our market positions.","Turning to Personal Insurance, net written premiums for the segment grew 8% in the quarter, with roughly half of that growth coming from price increases. The quarter\u2019s combined ratio of 104.1 was significantly impacted by weather, with catastrophe losses of nearly 10 points for the second consecutive quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 94.5 was also significantly impacted by weather, with non-catastrophe loss levels that were well above what we would normally expect in the second quarter.","Turning to auto, in terms of production, we are pleased that we were successful in maintaining strong retention, while achieving significant price increases. New business was down slightly year-over-year, while TIF growth moderated. The domestic agency auto combined ratio for the quarter was 106.4 with 4 points of cat losses more than double our normal second quarter expectation. The auto underlying combined ratio of 102.4 was also impacted by weather, with about 1.5 points of non-cat weather losses, which was above our expectations, but about the same as the second quarter of 2016.","Excluding the impact of weather, auto loss results remained in line with our expectations. Compared to the second quarter of 2016, the underlying combined ratio was up 3.8 points. As you can see on Page 15 of the webcast, the increase is primarily due to the timing of the impact of the higher run-rate of bodily injury losses that we recognized in the second half of 2016. As we discussed in our year end results call, in response to higher bodily injury loss levels we are taking actions to improve profitability, most notably by improving the pricing of the book.","Renewal premium change increased from about 6% in the first quarter to nearly 8% in the second quarter and we remain on track to reach double-digit increases before the end of the third quarter. By year end, we expect to have obtained enough rate on a written basis to address the elevated bodily injury loss levels. The full earned impact of these written rate increases will be realized by the end of 2018 consistent with the timeframe we mentioned in January. As we have discussed in recent quarters, the combined ratio also continues to be elevated due to the impact of tenure on our book as the higher levels of new business written in previous periods continue to season. We expect this impact will continue to grow for a few more quarters albeit at a decreasing rate. As new business production moderates to a steady state, the tenure impact will gradually diminish. The gradual reduction of the tenure impact, along with rate that keeps pace with loss trend over time, should result in a combined ratio that aligns with our target. It\u2019s important to note that even though the combined ratio is currently elevated due to the impact of tenure, we expect the new business to add economic value on a lifetime basis as the increased volume brings additional profit dollars.","Turning to Agency Homeowners and Other, the combined ratio of 100.3 for the second quarter reflects 17.5 points of cat losses. The underlying combined ratio of 82.8 was 4.6 points higher than the second quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to non-cat weather losses, which were also significantly higher than our long-term average. Continuing the momentum in recent quarters, Homeowners\u2019 net written premiums and policies in-force both grew at levels consistent with the strong results we experienced in the first quarter. We were pleased that we achieved modest price increases in this profitable line, added more property-oriented distribution partners, and focused on account rounding. So clearly, a significant impact from weather in the quarter, but we continued to grow our profitable Homeowners business and made good progress towards the goals we laid out for auto at the end of last year.","With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Kelly, we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Before we begin, I would ask you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan","Thank you and good morning. My first question on Personal Insurance, could you quantify the impact from the non-cat weather as well as a tenure in the second quarter results?","Brian MacLean","Yes. So, I will start with that. This is Brian. And let me do them in reverse order. On the tenure impact, we said last quarter or the quarter before that it was about 2 points and that\u2019s up about 1 point. So right now, it\u2019s about 3 points in total in the combined ratio and that\u2019s about 1 point delta from last year. On the non-cat weather of the 4.6 points you know variance in the underlying, the vast majority of it and you can think roundly about three quarters of that number is due to non-cat weather. And the reason for the lack of total precision there is that we are looking at a lot of loss activity in trying to attribute it and we were pretty accurate on it, but it\u2019s not something that you can specifically tie down and Michael has got a little bit more detail.","Michael Klein","Yes. I think so again, the 4.6 Brian is referring to as property year-over-year variance. And as you said, the majority of that is due to non-cat weather. I would say a couple of things on that front. One, from our perspective and I think you can look at weather data and see that it was a very active first half of the year from a weather standpoint. NOAA talked about nearly 11,000 severe weather events through May of this year being up over long-term averages. And I think importantly to back it up to what non-cat weather is right. So, our non-cat weather according to our definition does include some PCS events that don\u2019t meet our catastrophe threshold, but it also includes a variety of much smaller weather events that never make the news. And connecting that to the NOAA data one of the things that they talked about is through May, there were over 6,000 reports of wind damage, which is either wind damage or storms that have significant wind associated with them. Again, not the things that show up on the news, but according to their statistics, those events that 6,000 is almost double the average of the 2000 to 2016 run-rate. And it\u2019s the second highest amount of storms of that type since 2011. So, I think our experience is consistent with that, the drivers underneath that non-cat weather. The biggest incurred loss increases we see underneath that estimate are associated with wind and hail.","Kai Pan","Great.","Alan Schnitzer","So, that\u2019s a little bit more color on what\u2019s underneath that from a property.","Brian MacLean","Right. So this is Brian. So, that was a very good long answer to the question you didn\u2019t ask. I apologize for hearing that incorrectly. But on the auto side, there is 1.5 points as I said in the underlying, about 1.5 points of non-cat weather losses, which comparable to what we had in last year\u2019s results and I would say a good bit higher than what we \u2013 what our normal expectations would be, what our long-term averages are. So, hopefully that\u2019s responsive.","Kai Pan","I really appreciate the extensive response. My follow-up questions on expense ratio side, you have seen quite a bit of improvements in Personal Auto, will that continue? And then were you expanding any of these initiatives into the Business Insurance on the expense side, because we have seen some year-over-year improvement there as well? Are there more to come?","Brian MacLean","Yes. So, let\u2019s take the two pieces. Michael can talk a little bit. Expenses we have done \u2013 we have been doing a lot in Personal Insurance for the last couple of years and that is continuing and then we could talk a little bit about Business Insurance and what we are doing there. So, Michael on the PI\u2026","Michael Klein","Yes, from a Personal Insurance standpoint, the story continues to be that we are adding volume and holding costs pretty consistent. So, I mean that\u2019s a continuation of the story we have been talking about and we continue to see some of that benefit in the quarter.","Alan Schnitzer","Hey, Kai, good morning, it\u2019s Alan. Let me try to address your question on Business Insurance. So, we don\u2019t give outlook explicitly on expenses and there is always from period-to-period going to be some ups and downs in expenses. But we have had a number of initiatives underway. We have got initiatives underway now. If you looked at our shop floor right now, we\u2019d say that there is improved productivity. It\u2019s \u2013 you don\u2019t exactly see that coming through in the numbers in the moment, because for example there is other ups and downs and we have got the expenses associated, the cost associated with creating that productivity, but it is a serious and ongoing initiative that we are all hopeful that we will be seeing in incoming periods.","Kai Pan","Great. Well, thanks so much for all the answers.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, yes. My first question is on just in going through some of your commentary in the queue in terms of the outlook for the Business Insurance business for 2018 you point to stable renewal price changes and also stable margins. I guess just how are you expecting your margins to stay stable when even if we get continued exposure growth, your rate is falling below trend, if you could just provide some additional commentary and how you see kind of your margins in that business playing out in 2018?","AlanSchnitzer","Yes, good morning, Elyse, it\u2019s Alan. Thanks for the question. We do get that from time-to-time. And I think we have addressed that on this call from time-to-time. We get the math here looking at it\u2019s a very certain narrow rate versus loss trend. But what we have told you and what I tried to address in my prepared remarks this morning is that there are plenty of levers other than just pure rate that contribute to the margin outlook. And I mentioned some of it in my prepared remarks, things like segmentation and risk selection and claims handling and risk control expenses, all the rest. So, all of those things wrap up in margin. The component of margin that is sort of narrow rate versus loss trend, particularly when you take into account the component of exposure that behaves like rate from a margin perspective is and continues to be relatively small. And these incremental rate gains that we have been writing for a few quarters now have offset that to some degree. So, you take all that together and we are comfortable with a broadly consistent outlook. Of course there is going to be volatility from things like weather, but in terms of things we control we feel good about a broadly consistent margin outlook, we have been giving you that outlook for some quarters now and we have delivered on it. So, we feel good about it.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then just a couple of quick things on that Personal Auto side, the new business did decline this quarter, policy count still do go up sequentially. How do you see the policy count playing out as you continue to push for more rate? And a second question in the commentary you guys pointed to what you are doing to get back to your target margin in that business. Could you just remind us what your target margin is for the Personal Auto business? Thank you.","Michael Klein","Sure. And Elyse, this is Michael. I will start with the target margin question. I think broadly a combined ratio range of 96 to 98 points for auto is the range that we are shooting for over time. To your question on TIF and PIF growth, as we have talked about, our strategy is to improve profitability in auto, while growth moderates. We are very pleased with the trajectory that the TIF growth in the new business is on. We are also, I\u2019ll say particularly pleased with the strength of retention in the face of the increased rate. You see retention in the production slide at 85 points, actually above our long run average for that number, a number we are very pleased with as we have moved rate up almost a couple of points quarter-on-quarter. In terms of the outlook for PIF growth again our plan remains consistent. We are looking for moderate growth, while we continue to improve profitability.","Alan Schnitzer","And Elyse, it\u2019s Alan. I would just add on the margin target. There is some advantage we have to being an account solution, the fact that we have such a good Homeowners\u2019 book enables us to \u2013 gives us some advantage in the combined ratio target for the auto and not from a subsidization perspective, but from a synergy perspective, for example, the impact on retention and things like that. So, we think the fact that we are an account solution provider is a big help from that perspective.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you very much.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Jay Gelb","Thanks and good morning. With regard to the small commercial business market, Travelers is clearly a leader in that space. We have seen a number of other large companies looking to either enter that business or more insured tech focused operations trying to disrupt that business. Can you talk about how Travelers is defending its position in that profitable market?","AlanSchnitzer","Yes, good morning Jay, it\u2019s Alan. So, yes, we read the same retrofit you read to one degree or another, occasionally we see it in the marketplace, I think different competitors and others are at different stages of their engagement in the marketplace. And just a couple of things, one, we do have \u2013 start with a great position, we think that\u2019s important from a competitive perspective. We have got great technology. We have got great talent. We have got great data. We have got great relationships with distribution. We think all that\u2019s \u2013 all that\u2019s very important. And we are not standing still. So, some of the investments I mentioned in my prepared remarks are directly related to those businesses. That\u2019s important for us. And you look at investments like Simply Business that is meant to make sure that as we look around the landscape and see how the world is changing that we are positioning Travelers to continue to be effective and very competitive in that marketplace. And lastly, I would have that small commercial, in fact all of our businesses have always been competitive and we have got lots of arrows in the quiver that I guess I should say competitive advantages that enable us to compete effectively. So, we feel good about the outlook.","Jay Gelb","As competition increases in that space and it moves more towards technology focused, I mean, we see a number of these companies saying essentially one or two clicks and you get the quote to bind. Is Travelers where it needs to be from that perspective?","AlanSchnitzer","Yes. There is a lot of rhetoric out there. How much business is actually being transacted on that basis and how much is aspirational from the perspective whether that you are saying is something that is worth looking into. But I would say that we are as engaged as anybody on \u2013 in all those areas and as aspirational as everybody in all those areas. So, yes, we think we are where we need to be to make sure that we continue to be competitive. And again, just think about the innovation going on around here are the investments that we are making and we are not flat-footed. These aren\u2019t things that we are starting with today, these things that we in many, many cases have been thinking about for many years. And again I will just point to the Simply Business transaction. That\u2019s something that we announced a couple of quarters ago, but it\u2019s nothing we stumbled on a couple of quarters ago. That was the result of having been thinking about the exact issue you are talking about over a number of years and planning and being thoughtful and strategic about it. So I would say yes, we are where we need to be.","Jay Gelb","Appreciate it. Thank you.","AlanSchnitzer","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Jay Cohen","Yes. Just one follow-up, maybe two follow-ups on the personal line side, one is that PIF growth in the Homeowners business seems pretty resilient in the face of rising auto insurance premium rates. Would you expect to maintain that or could your effort to improve auto have some spillover effect on the Homeowners side?","Michael Klein","Jay, this is Michael. I think that\u2019s something that we have been talking about and focusing on and it is why in addition to our objective to improve profits and moderate growth in auto. Our other key objective is to maintain the momentum in homes. To Brian\u2019s prepared remarks, we have made some specific efforts to sustain that home growth in the face of seeking the auto rate, focusing more on rounded business. The good news underneath both the auto and the home growth is the strongest growth we see it in rounded accounts where we are writing both the auto and the home or writing the auto or the home with other lines of business. We are focusing on property intensive distribution relationships, focusing on distribution management and working with agents and brokers to make sure they are giving us at least our fair share of the property business that goes with the auto we write. So, I think through a series of specific tactics and strategies that\u2019s what helped us sustain the home growth so far and we are hopeful that we can continue that.","Jay Cohen","That\u2019s good answer. Thank you. The other just quick one on the auto side, if you look at second quarter underlying loss ratio versus first quarter that did get a bit worth, I am assuming some of that\u2019s non-cat weather and I am assuming some of that is seasonality. Is that a fair assessment?","Alan Schnitzer","Jay, tell us again what number you are looking at. Just so I want to make sure that we are looking the right thing.","Jay Cohen","Yes. I am looking at personal auto second quarter underlying loss ratio versus first quarter underlying loss ratio first quarter 2017, so consecutive quarter?","Alan Schnitzer","As you can see in the webcast, the lion\u2019s share of that is the timing of the recognition of the bodily injury losses and then there is the 10-year component that Brian mentioned.","Jay Benet","But if you are comparing Q2 this year to Q1 this year, Jay?","Jay Cohen","The timing shouldn\u2019t be an issue.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, I am sorry, I was thinking you were talking\u2026.","Jay Benet","Right. So, I think to your point, there is seasonality in that expectation is the key driver of that. Again, when we look at underlying consistent with the comments that Brian made, you do have non-cat weather impacting that. We have a higher loss ratio expectation in the second quarter than we do in the first largely related to weather and driving activity picking up.","Jay Cohen","Got it. Helpful. Thank you.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Meyer Shields","Great. Thanks. Brian, you mentioned when you are discussing to this insurance that there was lower non-cat weather in the quarter, is that just sort of randomness or is there some reason why you would see a divergence in non-cat weather losses between business and personal insurance?","Brian MacLean","Yes, I think it\u2019s mostly randomness. And when you think of what\u2019s driving the non-cat weather as Michael said, it\u2019s not the big, big catastrophe events, the smaller events are the ones that don\u2019t even make PCS events. And those things are more likely to have a frequency on the Homeowners side than they would on the business insurance side. So, it\u2019s probably mostly randomness and then some the nature of the beast.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes. So, Meyer, you think about hail for example and the types of things that individuals ensure are more susceptible to hail damage, for example, than commercial property that\u2019s more resilient.","Meyer Shields","Okay, that makes sense. The second issue when we look at the pricing changes in business insurance that are hovering around 60 basis points, which is appreciably different than the preceding four quarters. I am saying appreciably, so less than a point. Does that translate into sort of different expectations for core underwriting margins? Is it a little easier as that 60 basis points runs in?","Alan Schnitzer","Sure. I mean, it\u2019s just math right. As the pure rate goes up and by the way I would point out that the exposure is up 2, we are not calling that a trend, but it\u2019s broadly enough across our portfolio that for the most part we are attributing it to economic activity. But you look at that incremental price and you look at the component of exposure that behaves like rates and sure, it\u2019s math that it\u2019s a good guy from a margin perspective for sure. It\u2019s not \u2013 we are not at the point where they are equal to each other, but we are getting closer.","Meyer Shields","Okay. Thanks so much.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Sarah DeWitt","Hi, good morning. First, just on the personal auto insurance combined ratio target of 96% to 98%, does that include the tenure impact and what I am trying to get at is when you say you get back to your target margins by the end of \u201818 should we be thinking 96% to 98% plus a couple of points for tenure?","Michael Klein","So, Sarah to your point, let me just make sure I say this accurately. So when we say at the end of \u201818 we are not talking about the tenure. So, it is 96% to 98% plus a tenure impact. So I think it\u2019s the way you just said it. And\u2026","Alan Schnitzer","And specifically your comment about the end of \u201818 is rates covering the increased bodily injury loss estimate.","Michael Klein","Right, right. And so I think as you put those things together it answers I think the other way you asked that which is when we say 96% to 98% we are assuming that tenure has moderated and we are at kind of a steady state.","Jay Benet","But I will go back just to highlight Brian included in his prepared remarks which is we don\u2019t look as tenure as a bad guy, because it\u2019s part of the plan. It\u2019s adding economic value. And so that\u2019s deliberate.","Sarah DeWitt","But would it be zero by the end of \u201818 right?","Jay Benet","No, no, no. I think Michael said this in the last quarter comments I just repeat it is that when we talk about the timing of tenure unwinding what we are talking in terms of years, not quarters.","Sarah DeWitt","And then my follow-up is just could you revisit again what you are seeing in terms of lot trends this quarter. Are they consistent? Are there any signs of it picking up or moderating and if you could talk about commercial versus personal? That would be helpful.","Michael Klein","Yes. I will take that Sarah in our personal business, loss trend came in as we expected. So \u2013 and I think we have told in the past where expectations were, but there is nothing happened this quarter or first half of the year that was inconsistent with our expectations. And I would make the same comment about business insurance it\u2019s very stable and inconsistent with our expectations. Now, I am addressing in a sentence frequency and severity over $15 billion of business. So, there is always going to be ups and downs in one line versus another, but broadly speaking, we view loss trend in our commercial businesses as I am nothing remarkable consistent with expectations.","Sarah DeWitt","Okay, great. Thank you.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Meredith","Yes, thanks. Two questions here. First one, could you talk a little bit about what you are seeing with terms and conditions in the Business Insurance segment, any changes going on is the market getting maybe a little bit more generous in that area?","Alan Schnitzer","The short answer is no, we are not seeing anything significant. There is obviously always little movements up and down, but nothing dramatic that we are seeing.","Greg Toczydlowski","Yes. Again hard to address doing our premium in one sentence, but by and large, there is nothing that we are looking at that\u2019s causing us to think differently about current results or outlook.","Brian Meredith","Got it. Deductibles are covered. Okay, great. And then a second question just curious if I look at your commercial auto, some premium growth going on there, is that largely rates driven or you are actually seeing opportunities in the commercial auto to pickup business here?","Greg Toczydlowski","Yes, the short answer \u2013 this is Greg Toczydlowski. The short answer on that one is it\u2019s predominantly rate-driven across the portfolio. Our commercial auto book as we have shared in the past certainly hasn\u2019t been immune to some of the pressures that we are seeing across the entire industry on automobile. And accordingly, we have been pursuing rate on that. So, that\u2019s what you are seeing move through that top line. Because we are so much of an account solution, the retention has been pretty strong and so that gives us that net impact on the top line. So we are going to continue pursuing that strategy.","Brian Meredith","Great. Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed your question.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. Thanks for the call. I like to revisit that the little tick up we saw in the domestic business insurance from a rate perspective. And to your perspective, could you talk about how much that is you versus maybe the environment if we are assuming maybe a little bit of a tick up and awakening up of competition. We have seen a couple of surveys that suggest maybe sort of flatten your pricing and I just don\u2019t know how much to read into it?","Alan Schnitzer","Well, I would say, it\u2019s definitely both to some degree, right. I mean, it\u2019s us what we transact very deliberately on an account by account and class by class solution, so the rate we are getting is because we are trying to get the rate, but we are getting it because we operate in a very competitive marketplace and if the marketplace weren\u2019t letting as getting, we wouldn\u2019t be getting it. So, we are certainly not given the premium growth we have. So, I would say it\u2019s a combination of both. Now, I do think that we do have some advantages here maybe relative to the market. One, franchise value matters when it comes to pricing. So, product perhaps, relationships with distribution, which is valuable to our customers and our distribution, claims handling, risk control those things, I think really matter when it comes to the value we can deliver. And secondly, I would say we have got really important data and analytics and that helps us from a granular pricing perspective as well. So I would say it\u2019s the combination of the efforts the franchise value and competitive advantage that we have been in the marketplace.","Paul Newsome","Is there nothing in the competitive environment that you have seen any swings competitors moving it out or vice-versa or it is basically just kind of a general trend?","Alan Schnitzer","It\u2019s a little soft. Can you repeat that?","Paul Newsome","Sorry, the soft is voice. Have you seen any actual trends or changes in your competitors themselves, anybody moving in and out or making any changes from a pricing perspective?","Alan Schnitzer","It\u2019s just \u2013 it would be so hard without taking it through competitor by competitor, business by business, geography by geography to give you a sense of that, but there is always movements, competitor by competitor, business by business, geography versus geography. And so to the extent we see any of that occurring now, it would be consistent with the way we see that type of dynamic over time. So, in that respect, I am not really.","Paul Newsome","Okay, thanks very much.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Okay. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Shanker","Yes, thank you. A couple of questions on non-cat weather, I guess or maybe one. Allstate has taken the tax of reporting a much lower threshold for what they call catastrophe, but we should assume that of course there is going to be some level of cat activity in every quarter or every time they announced their numbers. When you talk but non-cat weather activity look over your data of the last 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, does that net \u2013 does the benefit and hindrance of non-cat weather net out to zero or is it a negative profit layer on the top of how we should look at things?","Alan Schnitzer","I am not sure, Josh, what you are asking. I mean, we have an expectation of what non-cat weather is going to do over time in a range and we set our prices in part based on that expectation. So whether it\u2019s a positive or negative over time is going to be a function of over time whether we are getting the right price for the losses. So, I don\u2019t \u2013 if you are asking sort of where it is in a particular period relative to a long-term average, we can give you that information too. But as I have said in my opening remarks, what we are seeing is certainly relatively high. There is no question about it, but not outside of what we would expect in the context of an over time range.","Josh Shanker","So when you say that three quarters of the personal lines deterioration is due to non-cat weather, that\u2019s non-cat weather above and beyond a layer of normal expectation?","Alan Schnitzer","Well, actually I think the number that you are talking about was a property number, but I think what we are explaining is a year-over-year variance. So, I think that the year-over-year variance, if I am remembering the number right, assuming like 4.6 points at least in home. And I think what Brian\u2019s comment was is that the lion\u2019s share of that is non-cat weather that was worse in the current quarter as compared to non-cat weather in the prior year quarter.","Brian MacLean","And then I did. So that\u2019s what I meant by the three quarters. I did also say in my comments that it was also significantly higher than our long-term average. So, maybe a little less than that other number whatever it might be, but still significantly higher than our long-term average and within a volatility as Alan said that isn\u2019t totally out of pattern. One of the tricky things with this, Josh, especially when we are talking about Homeowners but also with our commercial property, weather in totality makes up something between 40% and 50% of our total loss content. So, you are at some point you are almost talking about the loss ratio in aggregate, which if you are trying to include every single weather related loss. So it\u2019s\u2026","Josh Shanker","And just another avenue I guess of discussion, your results in Business Insurance continued to be very, very good regardless of weather the variance from a quarter ago. If you would accept 100 or 200 basis points lower level of profitability in that line of business, could you grow materially? Are you being \u2013 is there an opportunity that\u2019s not being met, because you are being so profitable than maybe you should relax profitably goals and instead grow?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, Josh. We have always thought that lowering price to generate incremental premium is a fool\u2019s errand, because we operate in a very competitive marketplace and you just end up with same relative market share at lower profitability. And once you lower the price and consequently lower the margins on the business you are keeping, then you got to write a whole lot of new business to get that margin back. So, we don\u2019t feel like that strategy. We like the strategy of again as I have priced on like a broken record, but on a very granular basis, looking at the accounts and classes of business that we are writing, we look at our loss cost in a yield curve and we calculated price that we think meets our return objective and that\u2019s the way we run the railroad. So, we don\u2019t like the strategy of lowering price to generate volumes.","Josh Shanker","Okay. Well, good luck and thank you for the answers.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Great. Thank you. This is what appears to be our last question.","Operator","And our last question comes from Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.","Larry Greenberg","Good morning and thank you. Just wondering can you give us any color on the environmental strengthening whether the complexion of that was any different than it has been in the past. I know it\u2019s a little bit better than a year ago. Is there anything maybe extrapolate from that related to the third quarter, it\u2019s best to sort of view and are you guys thinking any differently about how you should be managing these exposures?","Jay Benet","Hey, Larry. This is Jay Benet. So, in relation to the environmental charge this year versus what we saw last year you are right it was moderated from the levels of the prior year. It continues to be an area of frustration. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019d call at the level of a nuisance at this point in time. We are not talking about very large dollars, but as you know every year we take a crack at what we think is going to happen with regard to new policyholders, what happens with regard to the active policyholders, what\u2019s taking place in relation to defense cost versus actual cleanup cost and we have to make lots of assumptions associated with that. A year goes by or 6 months or whatever the period of time is, we look at what\u2019s actually taking place versus those assumptions. And what we say in the Q is what I am going to repeat here that the favorable trends, we have been seeing for a number of years continue. They didn\u2019t continue quite at the level that we expected, but there was still favorable when it came to policies presenting new claims of policyholders with new claims or what\u2019s taking place with regard to other aspects of it. But as we have refined those estimates in this particular case we came up with an additional increase to the reserves. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s the lion\u2019s share of it. I will say that there are parts of the country of the Pacific Northwest in particular, where cleanup costs are being a little more elevated than what we had anticipated. So, you do have certain jurisdictional elements associated with this that will change what your estimates of costs are, but I will go back to what I said before that on the overall context of our reserve levels in Business Insurance in the company as a whole. This is fairly de minimis item at this point in time.","Larry Greenberg","And nothing defense cost wise to extrapolate to asbestos or anything else?","Jay Benet","No, I don\u2019t think you can really extrapolate what takes place in environmental to asbestos, but I think you can, if you can extrapolate anything, you can probably look at what other companies have said about the same subjects of the asbestos and environmental and recognize that we are no different than everybody else. So, I think we will continue to address each one of these things. We have our claims study ongoing as it relates to asbestos and we have more news to tell about.","Larry Greenberg","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Excellent. This looks like we are wrapping up. Thank you all for joining us today. And as always, we are available on Investor Relations for any follow-up questions. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Ms. Nawi, you may now begin.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you, Lina. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.","Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer.

Fishman","Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we're very pleased to report a terrific fourth quarter to conclude a very impressive 2013. We posted full year operating income of $3.6 billion, coming from dramatic improvements in our underlying underwriting margins over the past 2 years, continued contributions from prior year reserve development, as well as more modest level of catastrophe losses than we've experienced in recent years.","These operating results, combined with our strategy of returning excess capital to shareholders, led to record earnings per diluted share of $9.46 and an operating return on equity of 15.5%. For the fourth quarter, we generated $981 million in operating income, producing operating earnings per share -- per diluted share of $2.68 and an operating return on equity of nearly 17%. I don't think we could be more pleased than we are with these results, particularly given the challenges that our industry has been facing over the last several years including, historically, low interest rates and more volatile weather patterns.","These 1-year results should not be viewed in isolation, but rather as part of the journey we've been on since 2010, when we articulated a clear strategy of thoughtfully and appropriately increasing the profitability for our products, particularly for those that were not meeting profitability thresholds. While improved rate, terms and conditions were our tactics, our strategy was, is and will remain all about producing superior returns. The returns of our products had deteriorated over a number of years from declining pricing, and the return deterioration was exacerbated after the financial crisis, when interest rates fell to historic lows.","In addition, it was apparent that weather patterns, at least in recent periods, had become more volatile. With the philosophy of not reaching for yield in our investment portfolio beyond where the risk return balance is appropriate, our strategy was to improve the price and, where appropriate, the terms and conditions of products that we sell so as to improve the returns on an account-by-account or class-by-class basis, with the additional goal of not disrupting our agent's business or the relationship with our insureds. The results since then have been nothing short of remarkable.","As Slide #4 indicates, underlying underwriting gain in 2013 was almost triple the amount it was in 2011 and demonstrates that we have way more than offset the decline in net investment income resulting from lower investment rates. Second, the impact on product returns, which is what drives us, has been impressive. Slide #5 in the webcast shows a summary analysis of our expected economic product returns and demonstrates that the impact on these returns has been consequential. On the slide, we show our analysis of expected economic product returns on a written business for 2 periods, the outlook for Q1 2013 as of that time and the outlook for Q1 2014.","The numbers noted in red indicate the percentage of our aggregate premium from products where the expected economic return on capital allocated to those products is less than 10%. The numbers in black indicate the percentage of our aggregate premiums where expected product returns are in the range of 10% to 20%. And the numbers in blue indicate the percentage of our premiums where expected product returns exceed 20%. The progress, we believe, is quite remarkable. I should note that this analysis does not directly correspond to a GAAP return, and I encourage you to read the important explanatory notes on Slide #6.","The significance of this analysis is that the very granular data we review played an important part of our pricing strategy and tactics and it is a critical element of our senior management analysis and review. We all spent a lot of time with it, and it is one of the most important tools. We have been on an analytical journey for a long time and have worked diligently on developing this analysis, and it allows us to be quite surgical in our marketplace strategy.","The conclusion to be drawn from the summary analysis is that we've made tremendous progress in driving our returns closer to our long-term targets. However, closer to is not good enough. For those who will consider that this analysis suggests we are finished trying to improve returns, that is just categorically wrong. We will continue to take pricing actions on an account-by-account or class-by-class basis for those accounts or classes of business that continue to be in the poorer performing segments of our portfolio. While after 3 years of pricing actions, considerably more of the portfolio has moved from poorer performing to better performing classes, there is still enough business in the poorer performing classes so that successful pricing actions should continue to result in improved returns.","Even for our better performing accounts, we will see great -- equal to or greater than loss trend when appropriate. We remain optimistic that we will be able to continue to execute this strategy successfully. Brian will speak more about rate and will provide some perspective on looking at the data on a segmented basis. And while we can't predict the future, the recent data as well as the most recent anecdotal observations from the field give us confidence that we will be able to continue to execute successfully.","We have also been helped in pursuing higher returns by somewhat increased interest rates, and Jay Benet will speak more to that. While we are not explicitly contemplating further meaningful increases in the near-term, in interest rates, that is, we do believe that interest rates will eventually rise from here and will provide further lift to returns.","We have commented before that we believe that many industry observers are putting inappropriate significance on the absolute number of rate gain, particularly the headline number that is so often quoted. While the number is interesting, it is not nearly as revealing as many believe, as the rate and retention in a much more granular basis holds the real key to success. It's also worth noting again that we are return-focused, and as long as our risk profile is appropriate, whether in underwriting risk selection or investment selection, we are agnostic about where product returns come from.","Our goal remains a simple one, top-tier profitability, and if we generate more capital than is necessary to support our business, returning that capital to our shareholders so as to right size our capital base. To that point, since we started buying back our shares in the middle of 2006, we have returned almost $27 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an amount which is now approaching the market capitalization of the company when we embarked on our active capital management program. The strategy has worked elegantly by producing superior returns, and we remain committed to it.","With that, let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay S. Benet","Thanks, Jay. By any measure, our fourth quarter results: record net income per diluted share of $2.70, record operating income per diluted share of $2.68, operating ROE of 16.8% and a GAAP combined ratio of 87.7%, were very strong. As has been the case all year, these strong results were built upon very solid investment and underwriting performance. Within the investment world, the recent rise in interest rates has lessened the headwinds that we and our industry have been facing due to historically low interest rates.","Slide 10 shows how average after-tax yields have increased for the long-term fixed income securities that we actually purchased during each quarter of 2013. For taxable, that increase was approximately 45 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year, while for tax-exempt, the increase was 105 basis points.","As we've done periodically, we've included in the appendix to this webcast the schedule showing our current expectations for maturities and calls of our long-term fixed income investments projected over the next 3 years, along with the expected impact on net investment income if reinvestment rates generally remain where they are today. All things being equal, while we still expect that fixed income, net investment income will decrease in the next 3 years, that decrease will be smaller than what we previously expected.","Turning to underwriting. We continue to earn rate increase in excess of loss trends in each of our business segments. This drove 130 basis point improvement in our underlying combined ratio in BI as compared to the prior-year quarter, although in PI and in FPII, the benefits from earned rate increases exceeding loss cost trends were more than offset by normal quarterly fluctuations in non-cat weather, fire-related losses and what we define as large loss activity.","Pre-tax cat losses were $53 million in the quarter, down dramatically from last year's fourth quarter, which included Storm Sandy, and pre-tax net favorable prior year reserve development remains strong at $259 million. As has been the case throughout the year, each of our business segments contributed to the favorable reserve development, which was driven by BI's general liability product line for accident years 2006 through 2012, FPII's Surety business for accident years 2006 through 2010 and by PI's Homeowners & Other business for both cat losses related to accident year 2012 and liability losses for accident years 2009 through 2012.","As I've done in the past, I'd also like to share with you a preliminary view of what our combined 2013 Schedule P is expected to look like when it is filed on May 1. On a combined product basis, all accident years, other than accident year 2012, developed favorably and the unfavorable development for 2012 is truly de minimis.","Looking at the data on a product line rather than on an accident year basis, our major product lines developed favorably across all accident years, except for relatively small unfavorable development in Auto liability and CMP.","Commercial and Personal Auto liability developed unfavorably by a little over $30 million and $20 million pre-tax, respectively, each having a reserve base of approximately $2 billion, driven mostly by the 2012 accident year, while CMP developed unfavorably by about $60 million pre-tax on a reserve base of approximately $3 billion, and that was spread out over several recent accident years.","Of note, workers' comp developed favorably by approximately $85 million pre-tax on a reserve base of approximately $14 billion, even after the $42 million pre-tax charge precipitated by legislation in New York related to the New York Fund for reopened cases for workers' comp that we disclosed in the first quarter and some very minor strengthening of about $60 million pre-tax for a few recent accident years.","We continue to generate capital well in excess of what is needed to support our business and, consistent with our strategy, we've continued to return very significant amounts of capital to our shareholders. Operating cash flows were in excess of $900 million this quarter, bringing total operating cash flows to over $3.8 billion for the year. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of almost $1.6 billion after returning almost $1.2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $182 million and common share repurchases of $1 billion.","And for the full year, we returned over $3.1 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $734 million and common share repurchases of $2.4 billion. All of our capital ratios remained at or better than their target levels. Our debt-to-total cap ratio of 21.3 was well within its target range during the quarter. Book value per share increased 3%, and adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, increased 4%.","For the full year, book value per share increased 4% and adjusted book value per share increased 12%. The difference between unadjusted and adjusted growth rates was driven by the impact that the recent rise in interest rates have on net unrealized investment gains. Those net unrealized investment gains were approximately $1.3 billion after-tax at the end of the year, as compared to $3.1 billion at the beginning of the year.","So with that, Brian is now going to provide some further insight into our operating results.","Brian W. MacLean","Thanks, Jay. I'll begin with Business Insurance, which had a very strong fourth quarter, with operating income of $634 million and a combined ratio of 88.9. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year development, was 91.5 for the quarter, an improvement of more than 1 point year-over-year, and 92.2 for the full year, an improvement of about 2.5 points over full year 2012. As always, there were a lot of moving pieces in the combined ratios.","In 2013, large losses were slightly higher, expense items were a net positive and mix changes were a net negative. Excluding these items, the pure margin expansion, that is the impact of rate increases in excess of loss trend, was 2.5 points in the quarter and 2.7 points for the full year.","Turning to the top line, we posted record-high net written premium volume for the full year of $12.2 billion. Looking at the production trends underlying the premium volume on Page 13, retention was up slightly from recent periods at 80% while renewal premium change was in line with recent periods at about 8%. The 8% included pure rate increases of about 6%, down about 1 point from the last few quarters. The rate increases continue to be broad-based and were led by Commercial Auto. New business volume in the quarter was $435 million, and for the full year, new business was over $1.8 billion.","Loss trend continued to run at about 4% for this segment, so on a written basis, rate gains continued to be significantly above our current view of loss trend. The aggregate production results were strong, but as Jay emphasized in his opening, our focus has always been on returns. And to understand the impact of rate and retention on returns, you have to examine the detail behind how we got to the aggregate results. We've talked before about how we measure our business returns on a very granular basis. By business, by line, by territory, in smaller accounts, by class and in middle and large accounts down to the individual account level.","Looking at this data for full year 2013 and the fourth quarter, we're very pleased with our execution. Specifically, retention in our better performing business was very strong, with reasonable rate increases. But our real opportunity is to get significant improvement on our poorer performing accounts. For example, think of the below 10% ROE section on the chart Jay showed on Page 5. Obviously, we're not going to share with the public the full granular detail at all the levels that we manage the business. But we did want to give some insight into our performance, specifically for those poorer performing business.","Slide 17 shows the renewal rate change over the last 8 quarters for the poorer performing segmentation bands in our middle-market business, about 20% of our total middle-market premium. And middle-market here includes commercial accounts, construction, technology and our public sector business. Intentionally, we didn't give you specific rate numbers, but they're all well into the double digits. So you can see clearly from this slide that over the last 2 years, we've been able to consistently get meaningful rate increases on the portfolio for poorer performing accounts.","Although the rate changes move slightly quarter to quarter, in our view, there doesn't appear to be a clear trend which would signal any real movement in the marketplace. For example, we believe that the fourth quarter 2013 decline in rate and increase in retention is more a function of our execution than a change in the marketplace. And accordingly, we see an opportunity to improve pricing in this book of business in the coming quarters. So the main thing that this data tells us is that, at least through the end of 2013, for the lower returning businesses in our portfolio, our ability to take appropriate pricing and underwriting actions to improve performance in those accounts has not changed significantly in the last 2 years.","Not all the segmentation bands have this level of consistency in rate change. But in each band, pricing gains continued to exceed the expected increase in loss cost and we continue to make progress in the accounts with the greatest opportunity to improve returns. The data underneath this graph, along with the other granular analytics we use to manage the business, gives us confidence that throughout 2013, our underwriters continue to execute well on our strategy, making the right targeted decisions, class by class, account by account.","As we continue to execute on our strategy of improving returns, if we are successful, the aggregate headline rate will come down over time. The key for us, however, is not the headline number, but instead will always be why our rate and retention numbers are changing regardless of direction and whether these changes are consistent with our goal of generating mid-teens return on equity over time.","Turning to our Financial, Professional and International business. Operating income of $171 million for the quarter was up 31% over the prior-year quarter. This increase was driven by a lower level of cat activity in the current quarter, as well as higher levels of favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying GAAP combined ratio of 94.7 deteriorated 3.2 points over the prior-year quarter due to a higher underlying loss ratio, reflecting a higher level of large losses and non-cat weather-related losses for international, as well as the Dominion acquisition, partially offset by earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends.","The increase in the underlying loss ratio was partially offset by a lower expense ratio reflecting the inclusion of the Dominion. Net written premiums were up 29% in the fourth quarter of 2013, driven primarily by the inclusion of the Dominion for 2 months. Management liability premium increased as a result of our decision to discontinue the excess of loss reinsurance treaty for this business.","In our Personal Insurance business, operating income was $237 million for the quarter and $838 million for the full year, an almost fourfold increase over full year 2012. A very strong result driven in part by lower catastrophe losses, but also reflective of improvement in our underlying Auto and Homeowner results.","The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 88.8, up about 2 points over 2012, due to unusually favorable fire and non-cat weather losses in 2012. On a full year basis, the underlying combined ratio of 88.3 improved 2.5 points over 2012 due to pure margin expansion.","Looking specifically at Auto production, retention was strong at 81%, renewal premium change was 7% and new business volume was up versus recent periods, while net written premium was down year-over-year.","The increase in new business volume was primarily the result of the rollout of our new product, Quantum 2.0. By the end of 2013, we had launched the product in 18 states, and while we are still in the early days of the rollout, we are pleased with our execution so far. To date, in these states, we are achieving the competitive position that we had modeled, both broadly in the marketplace and specifically in the comparative raters.","In addition, in these states, our agents have embraced the benefits of the new cost structure and product features.","Turning to Auto profitability. The underlying combined ratio was 102.2 for the quarter, an improvement of 3.5 points, and 97.6 for the full year, an improvement of 1.6 points. Earned rate in excess of loss trend contributed about 2 points of improvement for the quarter and about 2.5 points for the full year.","Our current view of Auto loss cost trend is about 4%, mix adjusted frequency continued to be benign, while severity trend remains stable at a slightly elevated level. Specifically, bodily injury severity trend this quarter remained in line with what we've seen over the past few quarters.","Turning to Homeowners. Production was strong in the quarter with renewal premium change of 10%, while retention ticked up to 84% and new business volume was up from the prior-year quarter. From a profitability perspective, our full year Agency Homeowners combined ratio was 77%, both on a reported and underlying basis. This outstanding result reflects the long-term strength of this franchise and the impact of the rate and underwriting actions we have taken in the marketplace over the last 2 years. We feel very good about our Homeowners results and the marketplace position of this business.","With that, let me turn it over to Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi","Lina, we will now like to open up for question-and-answer. [Operator Instructions] Lina?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I have one on investment income. It ran higher in our model even counting the real estate and private equity partnerships, and you've made an illustration of kind of higher investment yield you've been getting. So I guess the question is were there any other one-timers in the net investment income line this quarter, like prepayments, et cetera, or was this a reflection of what the kind of underlying higher rate environment is helping with?","William H. Heyman","It's Bill Heyman. There were no one-timers in the fixed income portfolio.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And where are you seeing -- I guess, where is the sweet spot of where you are investing now, I guess from a rating and new money yield perspective?","William H. Heyman","I think probably the municipal market. If you look at the differential spreads between book yields expiring and new money, it's closest in municipal. In fact, for a time in the fourth quarter, we were investing even yield with what was expiring, that's fallen off a bit. Generalizing, in order of attractiveness, municipals, corporates, mortgages.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And the quick follow-up there, is that -- was that attractiveness in the muni market a function of people's expectations of a potential Puerto Rican sovereign default, and is that something that's affecting how you look at the market, and do you guys have exposure there?","William H. Heyman","Well, in order, it's not really affecting how we look at the market. As far as our exposure, I could go through it in some detail. I wouldn't say it's material. We haven't purchased a Puerto Rican obligation in 12 years and as a legacy portfolio, most is short-term insured or both. But I think Puerto Rico probably did affect the market as a whole. And frankly, speaking selfishly, anything that cheapens the market is good news for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A question on the capital management outlook for 2014. If I do the quick math on 2013, add up dividends, share repurchase and then I guess M&A funded with cash, it equals about 105% of operating earnings. Should we think about that payout ratio level continuing in 2014 or maybe we should expect a slowdown, I see that exposure growth does seem to be picking up a little bit?","Jay S. Benet","This is Jay Benet. I think in terms of looking forward as it relates to capital management, the absolute level of capital that's needed to fund growth in the business is relatively small. So what we've said in the past is to look at operating earnings as a rough base as to what might be available for capital management activities like share repurchases, subject to what needs to take place with regard to, as we just said, funding the growth of the business, possibly making a contribution to the pension plan.","Although I will say our pension plan at the end of the year was overfunded at this point in time. So that doesn't require, in our view, much in a way of funding next year. But it's always subject to all the things that might take place in terms of how the world will change next year. But operating earnings would be the base to look at.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And lastly, a follow-up. So higher levels of non-cat large and non-cat weather losses appear to have materially impacted 2 of the main segments. I know this is tough to do, but can you help us think about the dynamics like, for example, were the losses a couple of points above historical levels or were they just much higher than prior levels which were very benign?","Brian W. MacLean","So Mike, this is Brian. For starters, in PI, which I think had the biggest swing, the real driver there was how low the fourth quarter was in non-cat weather in 2012. And so this year was more consistent with kind of a normal run rate level of a non-cat weather. In BI, it was relatively consistent. And in FPII, Alan?","Alan D. Schnitzer","Mike, it's Alan Schnitzer. In FPII, the small weather and the large losses compared to a very favorable result in the prior year. So that's really driving the difference.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie Capital U.S.A.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","My first question relates to the new slide, Slide #5, and again, this is extremely helpful, the Slide 5 and Slide 17. What I was wondering is, using that Slide 5 as a backdrop, could you sort of help us understand what might be the range of earned rates in those different buckets?","Jay S. Benet","What might be the range of earned rates in those buckets? Yes -- no, I understand. I'm trying to -- I wouldn't know how to answer that actually, because it's aggregated by product, by business.","Gabriella Nawi","This is Gabby. That is -- those are returns on capital, so obviously, it's underlying margin and the investment component on those cash flows.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","What I was trying to understand is...","Jay S. Benet","This is Jay Benet. It is weighted by the premium volumes associated with each one of the businesses. So I think it's a proxy. You could probably look at those weightings as, rough justice, approximately what the earned premiums are. But keep in mind, what Jay said earlier, this is an economic product yield going forward, what the returns are going to look like. This is not a GAAP yield. That's why we're having trouble answering your question. So let me, as a proxy, you can kind of divide the earned premium.","Brian W. MacLean","Amit, this is Brian. Let me go back, I think -- go back to my comments in the webcast. And you can kind of translate the ROE slide roughly into the poorer performing businesses, obviously, the bottom of the ROE chart and vice versa. And as I said, for the poorer performing accounts, obviously, we've got some that are still well into the 20s, but think solid double-digit rate increases.","Now I'm talking written, and you mentioned earned. So I'd have to think through how everything's get earned in. And although there, over the last couple of years, there hasn't been a great volatility. In the better performing businesses, as I've said in the comments, we're still getting rate increases on a written basis that exceed our loss cost growth. So you can kind of approximate what that would be, about the 4 percentage, 3 percentage range. But we -- and then there are other things in between.","Jay S. Fishman","I think this will be our last comment on it, because it's an unusual question. The analysis is our best estimate of the economic capital returns of the products being sold, I'll say, today, but think about it over the next quarter. And so there really isn't much of a rate assumption in terms of change in written rate. It is largely an earned rate embedded in what has already been written and will be earned in the quarter. But it's looking at the returns on a fully discounted basis. And so we're discounting that projected investment income. It is an economic return concept based on allocated capital. But it is, as of today, as of the next 3 months, that's why we say for the quarter.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","No, actually, that color is extremely helpful. But the only other question I have is that of a quick follow-up on the opening comments regarding the modest adverse development in Workers' Compensation. I'm trying to sort of reconcile the $85 million modest development with the growth in that line if I look on -- at page, the level of the supplement, and then the loss cost trends, can be -- can you sort of talk about how do you think about the returns in Workers' Compensation line? And maybe address that development a bit more?","Jay S. Benet","What -- this is Jay Benet. Let me talk about the development for a second. First of all, I do want to correct one thing. Worker's Comp developed favorably this year. It didn't develop unfavorably. What you heard us talk about before is that we have a very, very granular by-business line approach to calculating and evaluating our reserves.","So when one of our business units -- and these can be very relatively small business units, says they're seeing a trend, and maybe the trend is they have a few losses that went tabular, that were more than what they expect and, therefore, they feel they should be strengthening their reserves in that business line. That will bubble up through the reserves setting process, so I can't stress enough that when we're talking about a modest increase, it's against a reserve base or -- I'm sorry, a premium base of $3.5 billion in any given year.","So I think it's more a function of our businesses looking at things that are taking place, not putting news in a drawer, hoping that it goes away, but just reacting to whatever they currently see. It's not an indication that if you have a negative development in 1 quarter, you're going to get more development of a negative type in the next quarter. It is just the normal variations that we see going forward, and the quarterly reserve settling process. And as I've said, overall, Worker's Comp. developed favorably. And we can see the same thing in all of our lines and in same kind of variation.","Brian W. MacLean","So just -- and so I'll give you a couple of comments, this is Brian, on the -- from a business perspective how we're feeling about comp. And first of all, I'd say if you're looking at net written premium, the growth in net written premium is because of pricing, primarily rate. So that's been driving the growth there, not necessarily account growth. I'd also say, we understand comps very well. We understand this -- its challenges and its volatility. For the last 2-plus years, it's gotten the strongest rate increases across our portfolio. And I think we've got real competitive advantages there. So it's a state-by-state industry, class-by-class gain, and there are clearly some states and some classes that still need rate improvement, but in the aggregate, we feel very good about the returns.","Jay S. Fishman","I am -- Hi, it's jay Fishman. I misspoke on a comment about that Slide 5. Let me just correct it. I -- I'm told I said it's earned rate. It's not. That's a written rate analysis. It's the price, the rate at which the product is being written today. And so, again, just to correct the record on that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I do have a question on Dominion. I don't know if it could be possible to know kind of what the underlying was for Dominion in the fourth quarter, I mean what FP&II would've looked like x that. And if you could just talk about the rate -- the actions that you're taking in that book, and whether there are any constraints from a regulatory or other perspective that could impact your ability or will -- that will allow you to push for rates that you need to improve that business?","Alan D. Schnitzer","Sure. It's Alan Schnitzer. Let me try to take that. In the quarter, actually, the Dominion was all in neutral. It was adverse to the loss ratio, but favorable to the expense ratio, so that sort of netted out. But that was really the result of a couple of, I'll say, unusual things related to the transaction and just as an example, purchase accounting. So I think the way to think about that going forward is, for next year we expect the Dominion to have about a 2-point adverse impact on the overall FP&II combined ratio.","Now I'll also say that we expect that to be offset by some other things going on in the segment, so the way to think about the segment for next year is for 2013, we had an underlying combined of about 92, and we're expecting that to be broadly consistent in 2014, so just to put the Dominion in perspective. Certainly, there are -- we're harder at work on that business and trying to bring all the Travelers sophistication and know-how, and working with our FP&II and BI colleagues here in our U.S. based business to try to bring all the Travelers benefits to that business.","When you talk about regulatory constraints, you're probably referring to Ontario Auto. That's a fluid situation and, obviously, the regulators in Ontario were looking for some significant rate cuts. But we're also hopeful that, that will be combined with some commensurate reductions in loss cost. So it remains to be seen what the impact would be on the overall margins. But we are quite confident that even though we'll have that 2-point impact in 2014, that all the work that we will bring to that book over time will improve that result, and clearly, we'll evaluate that transaction as it impacts our ROEs for our international business over time, and we remain as optimistic about that today, as we did when we announced the transaction.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Thanks. And then, I guess, on that front, I mean, did you expect -- anything we can glean from what you expect for on a top line perspective, in terms of how much of the book you expect to keep versus part of the business that may go as a result of the rate gain or the rate action that you take?","Alan D. Schnitzer","It's right. I understand the question. I think given the size of the transaction and its significance to the segment in the overall business, we're not going to -- we're going to stay away from that level of detail. But I'll try to give you the combined ratio impacts to help you with the modeling as you think about it for next year, but I think, what we're trying to stay away from that level of detail on that side of business.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just 1 if I could on the -- on BI. I know that non-cat weather has created some noise in terms of the evaluating the year-over-years over the last couple of quarters. How should we think about the starting point for margins next year when we're comparing to this year, either fourth quarter or for the full year, as we think about the rate actions on a written basis earnings through?","Alan D. Schnitzer","So first of all, I'd -- you meant Business Insurance there, right?","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Business -- I'm sorry, Business Insurance.","Alan D. Schnitzer","Yes. I think, well, because in Business Insurance, there really wasn't much of an impact of non-cat weather. Last couple of years were very comfortable. It wasn't exactly the same number, but around it. There wasn't -- when you look at the full year 2013 in Business Insurance, there was a little bit of movement in large losses and mix change. But nothing really material. So that's probably a pretty decent benchmark of run rate, combined ratio or loss ratio. And then you can see our written rate numbers and how they're going to earn in overtime. So I think you can -- as we said, loss trends holding at about 4%. So I think you can kind of do that arithmetic. There isn't a lot of unusual stuff that's really distorting that number this quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So the first question was just a clarification on the Dominion acquisition. I believe it was mentioned that the acquisition would have a 2-point negative impact on '14 combined ratio. But I still thought that you said that the combined ratio will be flat '14 versus '13?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. That's right. And that's because while the Dominion transaction on itself has about a 2-point adverse impact, there will be other things that we expect to offset that. For example, a change in the reinsurance program in our management liability business, and as earned rate continues -- as written rate from that prior year and this year continues to earn in at a higher level than loss cost, so that margin improvement, together with the reinsurance program, on a segment basis we're talking about, should be about -- on an underlying basis x cats and PYD.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Sure. That's helpful. Okay. And then just looking at the Business Insurance segment. I'm looking at it for this quarter -- that's the fourth quarter. I'm looking at it on an accident year loss ratio x cats. It seems that, that number was relatively flat at about 61.2% this quarter versus the year ago quarter. Just curious, given the rate increases, I would have expected a 3-point improvement year-over-year.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. So in the quarter, there were some moving pieces, and there's always a little bit of weather and a little bit of large losses and a little bit of mix and are you talking this loss ratio, so expenses aren't impacting it. We saw about a 2.5 point, when we net through all of that stuff, the -- what we think of is kind of pure margin, the rate, x earned rate, x net to the loss cost trend was about 2.5 points in the quarter, down a little bit, it was about 2.7 points in the full year.","Jay S. Benet","Yes. One of the other things that's always going to impact the year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter look at the loss ratios, in particular would be mix changes in the business, which -- what products are of higher percentage 1 year versus the next, how much loss sensitive business there is relative to guaranteed cost, so I mean that's also impacting some of the quarterly variations that you're seeing.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And just one last question on pricing. I just wanted to get a clarification that you mentioned that the slowdown in rate is not because of market conditions, but more the actions that Travelers is taking and more of your businesses adequately priced. I just want to get a clarification on that?","Brian W. MacLean","So several comments there. I mean, clearly, in the poor performing business, we feel very good that our ability to get price improvements, terms and conditions, whatever we need to approve the account is pretty consistent with where it has been in the last couple of years. So there, we don't see a lot of -- a lot of market movement.","Jay S. Fishman","And this Jay. To the point that Brian made in his comments, what you'll see in the fourth quarter on that graph is a slight deterioration in rate and an increase in retention in those poor performing classes. So the comments about our own actions is that we would look back on that and say we didn't execute to allow retention to go up and rate to go a tiny bit down, a little bit down, in the poor performing classes. Not perfect, not perfect. It would have been better if we had achieved flat retention and rate have moved differently there. So Brian's comment was more specific to the management of those poor performing classes.","The question that I always ask when we're talking about marketplace competitiveness is, do our field underwriters think that if an account in a particular class came up for renewal today versus 1 year ago or 2 years ago, would the opportunity for rate improvement be viewed differently by a field underwriter today than it would have then? And I've asked the question many times in a lot of ways, and the answer that I get routinely is, in the poorer performing classes, no, no difference at all.","In the best performing classes, perhaps a little more difficult. Perhaps a little more difficult is quite literally the words that we hear. As we looked at the numbers, our rate gains, even in the best-performing classes, more than offset loss costs. And so that continues to be pretty good. The point about the headline number is that as business moves from poor performing classes to the better performing classes, by definition, the headline number is going to go down.","And it would be, I think, inappropriate to make a direct conclusion that, that number going down, therefore means that rate opportunity has peaked. What you're seeing much more is a change of mix within the classes than the ability to get a rate improvement in a particular class. And lastly, Brian mentioned that the poor-performing classes, that graph that's in the materials still represents about 20% of our...","Brian W. MacLean","Middle-market.","Jay S. Fishman","Middle-market business. So there's not -- it still represents a meaningful portion on which to improve rate. Now, I wish the answer for rate peaking or not peaking was a lot easier to say than that. It's just not. It's a complicated business with a lot of moving parts, different business, different lines, and after 3 years, different levels of profitability. But that's the most fulsome response I think that we can provide.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question then.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And 2 good new slides this quarter, and I guess just trying to synthesize them. The point you're keen to -- seem to be making is that the mix of accounts sort of how much you need is, you're taking, is stable, but as accounts naturally improve, they're sort of fewer, fewer on which you need to take weight. I guess if we could, just to belabor the point then -- just to set expectations for headline run rates, though.","Should we as investors expect them to continue this sort of this slow downward trajectory into 2014 or -- 2013 was reasonably stable for most of the year after you guys sort of set a trajectory at the end of 2012. And I'm wondering, if you think it's going to look more like last year, or if the recent trend for the next -- for the past quarter or 2 is likely to persist, of pricing slowing as we work our way through the year?","Jay S. Fishman","I think it's very difficult for us to project in the short term, because it's a function of which accounts in particular come up for renewal in a given quarter. So it's difficult to compare a third quarter to a fourth quarter or a fourth quarter to a first. They're not the same accounts. It's a different batch. So in the short-term, I'd -- we would struggle to answer that. We just don't have the insight that I think you all think that we do.","In the longer-term, if we continue to be successful, I would say with certainty the headline number will continue to go down. As accounts move into our best-performing business, our goal changes to the highest retention possible consistent with maintaining margin. That's very, very different than the philosophy in the poor performing accounts where lower retention, if we're unable to achieve meaningful rate gains, is just fine. Our goal is always to improve product returns. And once accounts get into a range that are consistent with the highest levels of profitability in our industry, we begin to move much more to retention.","And so if we're successful, my expectation is that our retention will slowly tick up over time, again, I'm not speaking about quarter-to-quarter because the mix will change, and that the headline rate number will continue to come down over time. If it doesn't, there's really something that we're executing that's not quite right. Now, again, quarter-to-quarter because the accounts themselves are different, not nearly as predictable, but as an overall trend, that's really is -- that's the way that we look to the business.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. So, if I ask if one kind of final question, growth. You guys are starting to get some results from Quantum, separately, it looks like in a commercial lines business, you might be seeing significant growth in the targeted risk section a bit. I'm interested in your thoughts of both in sort of success of Quantum and maybe more qualitatively what agents are really -- sort of what sort of feedback you're really getting from agents, as well as if there's anything that we should be inferring from sort of rising growth in a couple of your smaller Business Insurance lines?","Jay S. Fishman","It's Jay Fishman. I'll start with Quantum, and I'll ask Gregory Toczydlowski to chime in and provide perspective, and then I think we'll look to Brian for comments and Bill come in as well on Business Insurance. Our goal in Quantum, remember we shared with you that we had back tested it and had a view of how the product would be positioned in the comparative rating engines, our goal was to achieve a meaningful improvement in its positioning in those comparative raters. That doesn't mean a reduction in profitability because of cutting price, you got to absolutely remember that Quantum's premise is a lower cost, lower commissioned product and, therefore, could support the same returns at a lower price. That's the entire philosophy of it.","As of year-end, we were in 18 states. The -- we do know, were it's positioned in the comparative rater. We get the data. And its positioning so far is consistent with our back testing modeling. It is doing, from a comparative rating positioning, just what we had hoped it would. Now, no idea what competitor reaction will be perspectively, or what will happen. Our goal initially was to do the analysis thoughtfully and see that we have the product positioned in the comparative rating engine correctly, and the price was what we had contemplated it would be. In that regard, so far, so good.","It, obviously, you don't get -- we have an analysis, an assumption of loss content. We will find out as losses begin to develop, how good that is. We don't have a point of view, or view on that yet other than the analytics that we did when we developed Quantum 2.0. So we're not yet declaring victory that the underwriting margins coming from it will be consistent with what we modeled. We're hopeful. We will know more of that relatively soon, I suspect over the next, I don't know Greg, a couple few quarters we'll begin to have a view on the loss content. In terms of agent react -- why don't you, one of you go through the agent reaction, anything else you want about that.","Jay S. Benet","Yes. I think just as you said, the agent reaction has been very positive. We're 3 months in to the big wave that went out in October and we're actually not surprised on that. We have a lot of co-development with the agents that were right here in Hartford in helping us to design the structure, the features of it, and so we got a lot of feedback from them in helping build the product. And the 2-key metrics we're watching right now are we seeing an increase in flow, the amount of at bats or quotes and we are seeing that.","And then the actual success of our competitive position of those quotes that we're seeing a meaningful uptick there. So when we put both of those together, we're very encouraged and as Jay said, the loss experience will be the third leg of the stool, that we're not waiting for a full loss ratio to develop. We're spending a lot of time looking at surrogates or leading indicators, including the profile of the business. And again, we're encouraged on that. So across-the-board, we're going to continue rolling it out with the same level of discipline and we are very enthusiastic as we do that.","Brian W. MacLean","On the BI front, as Jay mentioned as, were about returns and as returns improve, we're going to be more interested in retaining more business and we feel good that we had record net written premium in BI. It is clearly being driven primarily by pricing actions. Independent of price, there are a lot of things that we're doing to leverage competitive advantages and various strategic initiatives to grow and we've got a lot of that. The thing that we won't be doing is trying to grow through playing a price game. So we're not going to run a sale in the hopes of increasing our market share at the expense of returns, so.","Jay S. Fishman","I think that's important. The questions that we get on many of these calls seem to center on the impact of pricing and growth. We do have a series of initiatives in our Business Insurance segment that are designed to produce growth, including in 1 case, more salespeople. And hopefully, it actually turns around and has an impact, but we will find out. Because we have a disciplined view of price, doesn't mean that we refuse to think of, or abdicate responsibility for finding growth opportunities that are there by product, by people, by expertise, by underwriting skill, and we remain committed to that. As a business that generates 20-odd-plus billion dollars of premium a year, it's a challenge to generate numbers that are consequential in the total. But it doesn't mean that are -- we don't have serious effort and work to try to find those opportunities. We do.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On the explanatory notes, on the expected economic return table, you talked about $2.5 billion of statutory surplus that was not allocated in this analysis. Should we think of that as excess surplus? Or if not, why wasn't it allocated?","Jay S. Benet","Jay, this is Jay Benet. First of all, there is some fluidity in what the statutory surplus balance is going to look like each quarter, because we have earnings and those earnings will get dividended up to the holding company. So that's part of it. But we also have, as you know, asbestos and environmental reserves and some other runoff businesses, so there's capital that supports that as well. So what we've done in this model is we've allocated all the capital that supports what we've referred to as The Business, to those -- to the products associated with the business. So we think it's a -- in that regard, a full allocation of the capital that we have for the businesses.","Jay S. Fishman","And the majority that is not allocated is attributable to what we also would call these runoff businesses, meaning specifically asbestos, environmental and such.","Operator","And we have a question coming from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of quick ones here. First, can we chat a little bit about the Homeowners Insurance business? It looks like your underlying combined are in pretty good shape there. And I guess my question is, what point do you think you're going into pull back on some of the rate that you're getting in Homeowners, and maybe, to potentially look to grow that line of business? And could that help at all with some of the Auto insurance growth?","Brian W. MacLean","So, Brian, this is Brian MacLean. The -- clearly, the Homeowners combined on a -- on any basis you look at it, we feel very good. There's obviously been a huge story of weather volatility that we're still -- so there's still a decent number of places around the country that we are still taking some underwriting actions and looking at managing that. Broadly speaking, you can look at our rate filings and see that our rate there is tempering a bit.","But in the aggregate, still haven't a need. We do expect that we will get some lift through the Quantum product. We are very much an account-focused personal lines company. So we sell more combined Auto and Home than any of the other major competitors. And so we should be getting a lift as our Auto product moves out into the marketplace and get some of the traction that we were talking about before.","Jay S. Fishman","And I'd love Greg [ph] to comment on -- I'd just make an observation, we take it for granted. Our pricing, terms and conditions profile in Homeowners is not anecdotally driven. Right? It's not as if it's instinctive. We're basing it on the data and the information that we have.","Unknown Executive","Yes. And as Brian said, that really does have a local story underneath that. When you're following the perils across that product line. So as Brian said, based on some of the weather trends and the perils, we've got various strategies across the country right now.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then my second question just quickly here, on Business Insurance and FP&II, are you seeing any loosening at all in terms on [ph] conditions and from a competitive landscape out there, anything that we should be concerned about as investors?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. In the aggregate, no. And that's something we're put [indiscernible] encouraged with, so we feel good about that.","Gabriella Nawi","And this will be our last question for today.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have 2 questions. The first is, so far in the first quarter, there's been some pretty severe freezing temperatures. I'm just wondering if that could lead to elevated non-cat weather from things like burst pipes in the first quarter.","Brian W. MacLean","I think, Jay, the honest answer is it's too soon to tell. But no question, when you get the severe temperature changes that you get, we get claim activity from that and we've seen some of that. We can't really assess the magnitude of it and forecast here in Northeast is another round in the next couple of days. So we will watch it. But -- and it's actually maybe less about the Northeast and more about when you get those severe temperatures in mid-Atlantic and down south, where you really start having some challenges. But there will be claim activity coming. There is claim activity coming out of it, but we don't -- we haven't scoped it.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And the second one, on a broader issue, as the economy recovers, we're seeing the benefit of increased exposure growth, but I think there's also the looming issue of potential increase loss cost inflation, both on frequency and severity. So when you talk about is -- 4% for baseline loss cost inflation and Business Insurance, to what extent could we see that move up as the economy recovers?","Brian W. MacLean","So I think, again, this is Brian, Jay. Things we worry about all the time, we are seeing a little bit of exposure movement from a positive kind of GL and comp driven, which are good things. Nothing dramatic. But there's a little bit of movement there.","Jay S. Fishman","Good news.","Brian W. MacLean","It's quite positive news, right. And on the -- so supporting your comment about signs of some economic growth, we -- all I can tell you is we obsess over looking at every metric we can about what's going on in loss trend, and we continue to be encouraged that we're not seeing anything out of pattern, that probably the biggest thing that we look at that we've been talking about for years now is the Auto BI trend, bodily injury trends, and -- across all of our businesses. And that continues to run at elevated level, but it hasn't been getting worse in the last several quarters, so -- but we look at it closely.","Jay S. Fishman","And I think that it\u2019s -- we still far fear to say, broadly speaking, I'm not speaking about the insurance industry now or us [ph], but broadly speaking, there remains not yet a meaningful change. In fact, but argue there isn't any change in actual inflation, at least by the traditional measures by which it's reported. We pay a lot of attention. We read everything we can. But it\u2019s very much kind of an outlook question, and who the heck knows. I think it's the answer there.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","As long as overall economic inflation remains benign, should that be a pretty decent indicator on loss cost inflation if you boil it down?","Jay S. Fishman","I think we have -- I think the property-casualty industry has some specific areas where we have a little bit of, what I'd call, inflation concentration dynamics. So wage inflation as it relates to Workers' Comp, medical inflation as it relates to Workers' Comp. Tort inflation as it relates to general liability.","Building products as it relates to Homeowners and to some extent, Select. Like, we're not about food, we're not about energy, really, there are some pockets that are more relevant to our loss cost trends than the basket kind of dynamics that you'd pick up from traditional economics. So we rely pretty heavily on our own look, our own ability to look at the data, the actual data, the emerging data on those areas that affect us, and look, you can speculate on a lot of things.","You can speculate that perhaps medical inflation will actually continue to decline. I don't know, you could also speculate that it will go up. There certainly more than enough economists who share an equal number of views on that. The tort environment takes a long time to change. Things don't change so quickly in that regard.","So while it's always on our minds, because it's important for us, it's not something that, that's going -- I don't -- we don't think -- I don't think personally, in my point of view, that it will be something that will occur quickly, or be a great surprise when it occurs. It will begin to evidence itself slowly, and I hope that we'll see it and be able to react from a pricing standpoint with respect to it. Now I could always be wrong, it might not be the right assessment, but that's how we think about it.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you all for joining us today.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","This morning, we reported second quarter operating income of $649 million or $2.20 per share, and an operating return on equity of 11.6%. Our underwriting results remained strong, as reflected in our 93.1% combined ratio for the quarter, despite the impacts of higher catastrophe and non-cat weather-related losses year-over-year.","For the six months, we reported operating income of $1.35 billion or $4.52 per share, and an operating return on equity of 12%. Given the cumulative impact of years and years of declining interest rates on our investment portfolio and also relative to the fresh lows in the risk-free rate, we feel terrific about the returns we continue to generate.","Our expertise in risk selection and pricing, our thoughtful and consistent investment strategy and our active approach to capital management all come together to enable us to achieve our objectives of delivering superior returns and creating shareholder value.","Turning to production, the second quarter was another example of the successful execution of our market place strategies. We are very pleased with the record volume of premium that we wrote in the quarter and we continue to be very pleased with the amount of returns in the business we\u2019re writing.","In our commercial businesses, retentions remained high and renewal premium change was positive. Underneath that, consistent with our very granular approach to execution, in middle market, we retained 90% of the premium from our best-performing accounts with only a modest decline in renewal rate change on that business. On our poor-performing accounts, we achieved renewal rate change in excess of loss trend. You might have noticed that renewal rate change in domestic business insurance was slightly positive as compared to slightly negative in the first quarter, and renewal rate change in middle market improved by four point, we don\u2019t forecast rate and we\u2019re not calling a bottom, but the significance of this to us is that the market remains remarkably stable and we\u2019re generally successful in achieving our written objectives.","In terms of new business, we are actively seeking and finding opportunities that meet our return thresholds, and we delivered strong new business growth in our commercial businesses, including 10% growth in new business and domestic business insurance.","In personal insurance, net written premiums grew 9% to a record of over $2.1 billion, with accelerating momentum in both auto and homeowners. New business was up 21% year-over-year, driven by the success of the Quantum product. Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our financial expectations and is successfully enhancing our market position. Our success in the market place across all our businesses really speaks to the value of the talent that we have in the home office and in the field, and their ability to leverage our data and analytics and work with our distribution partners to deliver great products and services and fair prices to our customers. Franchise value matters.","Before I turn the call over to Jay Benet, I\u2019d like to acknowledge and thank all of our colleagues in the Claim organization for their extraordinary efforts and handling the claims of our customers, affected by severe weather and fire so far this year. These experts are on the frontline for us delivering on the promise we extend with every policy that we write and it has been a very active year so far for them.","Their responsiveness and expertise are great to our customers and an important competitive advantage for us. In Canada, where we saw significant wild fires in the Fort McMurray area, both our customers and we benefited from the work we\u2019ve done to replicate our US claim model, which enables us to respond to large scale events with our own highly-trained professionals and resources without resorting to independent adjustors. So, all in all, solid results for the quarter and the first half, particularly in light of the weather and wildfires and continued excellent execution in the market place.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over Jay Benet.","Jay Benet","Thanks, Alan. As I did in the first quarter, I\u2019d like to start by saying that we were pleased with our results. Operating income of $649 million and operating return on equity of 11.6%, despite they\u2019re being lower than in the prior-year quarter. These reductions did not result from significant changes in underlying business trends, notably as indicated on page four of the webcast.","The quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating income was impacted by among other things, PCS, cat events and lower fixed income, net investment income. Losses from PCS cat events was met or exceeded our threshold for recording as cat, which is $79 million higher after tax than in the prior-year quarter, while losses from PCS cat events has gone below our cap thresholds which we recorded as part of non-cat weather related losses within underlying underwriting results for $56 million higher after tax than in the prior-year quarter.","And fixed income NII was $21 million lower after tax, primarily due to the continuing the low interest rate environment as we had anticipated in the outlook section of our first quarter 2016 10-Q. Everything else was pretty much a wash.","We continued to experience net favorable prior-year reserve development, which totaled $288 million pretax or $192 million after tax this quarter, up from $207 million pretax or $133 million after tax in the prior-year quarter.","The business in International Insurance, net favorable development of $138 million pretax or $94 million after tax, primarily resulted from better than expected loss in domestic workers comp for accident years 2006 and prior and accident year 2015. Better than expected loss experience in domestic general liability for accident years 2011 and 2015 and better than expected loss experience in our European operations partially offset by an $82 million pretax of $53 million after tax increased through environmental reserves.","In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $150 million pre-tax or $98 million after tax, primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in Fidelity and Surety for accident years 2010, 2013 and 2014, and better than expected loss experience in GL for accident years 2007 through 2011.","Year-to-date, on a combined-stat basis, for all of our US subs, all accidents years have developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development. In addition, other than commercial multi-peril, all product lines have developed favorably year-to-date. While CMP developed unfavorably by $42 million year-to-date, you may recall me telling you in the first quarter that there was an offsetting favorable development in the Property product line, as middle market property losses that had been recorded in the Property line at year-end 2015 was subsequently determined to be CMP-related.","Operating cash flows of $443 million were very strong, particularly recognizing that they were net off the $524 million payment we made this quarter as final settlement of the PPG asbestos litigation. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.75 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains increased to approximately $3.6 billion pre-tax or $2.3 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $85.73 and adjusted book value per share of $77.61 increased 7% and 3%, respectively, also from the beginning of the year.","We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned $747 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, through dividends of $197 million and share repurchases of $550 million. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve retuned over $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Before turning the microphone over to Brian, there is one additional topic I'd like to cover, our cap reinsurance coverage. In addition to our corporate cat aggregate XOL treaty, which we renewed at the beginning of the year, our cap reinsurance includes cap bonds that are specific to the Northeast US along with the Northeast Gen Cat Treaty.","With respect to the cat bonds, one, that had provided up to $300 million of coverage for certain losses, expired as scheduled in May 2016, and given our current risk profile, we decided not to replace it.","With respect to the remaining cat bond, which will not expire until May 2018, the attachment point and maximum limit will reset as required annually to adjust the model\u2019s expected loss of the layer within the predetermined range. For the year beginning May, 16, 2016, we will begin recovering amounts under this cat bond as losses in the covered area for single occurrence reaching additional attachment amount of $1.968 billion. The full $300 million coverage amount is available on a proportional basis until such covered losses reach a maximum $2.468 billion.","And finally, our Northeast Gen Cat Treaty was renewed on July 1. This treaty provides up to $800 million, part of $850 million of coverage, subject to $2.25 billion retention. The certain losses arising from hurricanes, tornadoes, hail storms, earthquakes, and winter storm or freeze losses from Virginia to Maine. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage including a description of earthquake and international coverage is included in our second quarter 10-Q, which we filed earlier today as well as in our 2015 10-K.","While the total cost of these treaties is small, in relation to our operational income, we were able to save some money by not replacing the expiring cat bond. And with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.","Brian MacLean","Thanks, Jay. In business, the new international insurance, we're pleased with the results this quarter. In domestic business insurance, we achieved a very strong retention along with the modest increase in renewal rate change versus the first quarter and higher levels of new business. Our strategy has not changed as we strive to retain our best-performing accounts, get rate where needed and write new business when it meets our target returns.","This has been our strategy for some time. And as a result, we continue to be viewed as the stable and financially strong market by our distributors and customers. Along with the meaningful competitive advantages that we deliver, this consistent leadership position is resulting in additional growth opportunities for us.","Turning to the financial results for the segment, operating income was $393 million with the combined ratio of $97.5 million. Cat losses for the quarter were $143 million net after-tax, which included $61 million from the Canadian wildfires. Excluding the Canadian fires, cat losses were slightly higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats in prior-year reserve development, was $95.5 million, up 2.4 points compared to the second quarter of 2015.","The loss ratio increased by 1.7 points, driven primarily by non-cat weather, which was higher than prior-year quarter and our expectation. The expense ratio was up seven tens of a point over last year, driven primarily by commissions as the second quarter of 2015 benefited from a one-time favorable adjustment.","Net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior-year quarter with domestic business insurance premiums up about 2%. Given the returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention. And so, we were very pleased that retention remains at 85% for the quarter, renewal premium change was just over two points, including renewal rate change that was slightly positive. New business of $525 million was up 10% versus the second quarter of 2015.","Turning to the individual businesses within Business Insurance, beginning with select, we achieved retention of 82% and renewal premium change of nearly 6%. Rate change was down slightly versus the first quarter of 2016, while exposure was in line with recent periods and new business was up slightly year-over-year.","In middle market, retention remained very strong at 87% with renewal premium change of about a point and a half, in line with recent quarters. In terms of new business opportunities, given our leadership position in the market, submissions were up year-over-year. Accordingly, we had more opportunities to quote on the types and classes of business we find attractive and to grow our new business while maintaining our return thresholds.","In Other Business Insurance, retention of 82% was up a point year-over-year, while renewal premium change was 0.5 and new business of $154 million was consistent with the second quarter of 2015. As we've mentioned in the past, Other Business insurance includes our National Property Business. While there continues to be some rate pressure in this business, returns remain attractive, and as a result, retention is our priority.","As you can see, on Page 13 of the webcast, excluding National Property, renewal rate change for Other Business Insurance remains positive and was relatively consistent with recent quarters. In International, net written premiums for the second quarter were down about 12% quarter-over-quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums were down about 9%, driven by disciplined underwriting actions in our UK business, along with lower economic activity impacting the Marine and energy lines of our Lloyd's business.","New business of $107 million was up 67% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our new strategic Personal Lines Auto product in Canada, which was modeled after our US-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product, so always a good quarter for the segment with strong production and profitability.","I'll turn now to Bond & Specialty Insurance where we had another terrific quarter. Operating income of $202 million was up significantly from the prior-year quarter, driven by a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 80.9% remains exceptionally strong. As for topline, net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior year, as growth in Management Liability was offset by lower Surety premium. The lower Surety volume was due almost entirely to favorable one-time reinsurance impacts in the prior-year quarter.","Across our Management Liability business, retention remained at historically high levels and new business volumes were up, as we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best accounts, underwriting more business in our return adequate product segments. We continue to feel great about this segment's performance.","In Personal Insurance, results were again strong and remain particularly pleased with our ability to add topline growth at appropriate financial returns. Net written premiums for the quarter up $2.1 billion were an all-time high with double-digit growth in Agency Auto, while growth also accelerated in Agency Homeowners and other. In both products, we continue to produce strong retention and new business levels. Agent and consumer receptivity to Quantum Auto 2.0 remains exceptional and importantly, as significant amount of Quantum Auto 2.0 business are now coming through their renewal cycles, we're pleased with the retention rates we're seeing on those policies. In Homeowners, our growth momentum is building due to crossover benefits from Quantum Auto 2.0, as well as pricing changes and improvements to Agent and customer experience.","Turning to profitability, operating income for the segment was down compared to the prior year quarter, due primarily to lower net favorable prior-year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 89.5% was in line with our expectations, but up about point from the prior year, driven by the impact of the significant new business volume in recent years and normal quarterly volatility in weather and other loss activity.","In Agency Auto, the 101.3 combined ratio included 2.7 points in cash, primarily resulting from hail storms. Weather also impacted the underlying combined ratio with 1.7 points of non-cat weather-related losses, which is approximately one point higher than both our expectations and the second quarter of 2015. The remaining increase in the underlying combined ratio was driven by the high levels of new business that I just mentioned. As we've noted before, the Quantum Auto 2.0 business is priced to our long-term target returns and loss experiences performing in-line with our expectations.","Turning to Agency Homeowners and other, underlying financial results remain strong. The second quarter underlying combined ratio of 78.2% is well within our target return levels as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies. So overall, for Personal Insurance, we feel great about the growth in the financial returns that the business is generating.","Before I turn it back to Gabby, I would like to take a moment to recognize Doreen Spadorcia who announced her retirement from Travelers' effective September 1st of this year. Over the past 30 years, Doreen has played an important role on our management team, and we wish her well as she enjoys a new chapter of her life. With that, let me turn it over to Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you, Brian. Tina, we are now ready to start the Q&A portion of the call if I could ask the participants to limit yourself to one question and 1 follow-up, please. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Randy Binner of FBR and Co. Please go ahead.","Randy Binner","Hey, Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to talk about the underlying combined ratio in business and international. And I think in the comments and in the press release, you attributed the increase of 2.4% to non-cat weather, but as well as loss cost not being covered by earned pricing. And so, I think - can we get more granular on that, because we\u2019re at a point in the cycle where not covering loss cost with earned trend is potentially an issue and just wanted to get a better detail on that.","Alan Schnitzer","Sure, Randy, it's Alan, I'll take that. So the underlying combined ratio in that segment, you're right, was down 2.4 points. Part of that was commission and that was a year-over-year comparison thing, nothing going on there. The other piece of that was in the loss ratio, the majority of that does come from non-cat weather. There is a relatively small piece of earned rate versus loss trend coming through. And one of the reasons we showed you Page four in the webcast was to try to put that in a little bit of context. So really what's impacting year-over-year is the weather. You get, as we said before, we tried to make clear that rate and loss trend is one small piece of what goes on, but there is also taxes, expenses, base year, mixed - the impact of changes in claim handling, things like that. Everything else, as we would've expected was a wash. So, there is nothing in that that earned rate versus loss trend that was surprising to us or that we think shouldn't had been evident from the return information we\u2019ve provided over the last year or so.","Randy Binner","Is that - is the piece of it, though, that's the loss trend versus earned pricing, is that - I think you're saying that it\u2019s not surprising you, but it does seem to be changing, is it a bigger piece of the equation than it has been in the last few quarters?","Alan Schnitzer","It\u2019s the earned impact of what we\u2019ve been disclosing is written over the past year. So it's earning in as we would've expected and we called it out just in the interest of transparency. But again, nothing that surprises us and given where our return and earned returns are, nothing that we\u2019re not comfortable with.","Randy Binner","And then just finally\u2026 Sorry, go ahead.","Alan Schnitzer","I would just say - as I said in my prepared remarks, Randy, we're very comfortable with the model returns on the business we\u2019re writing, and so just to give you a little bit more context.","Randy Binner","And then with non-cat whether, this would be truly episodic, nothing trend wise you\u2019ve seen in that?","Alan Schnitzer","That's correct. Nothing trend wise and that, it's all volatility and non-cat weather.","Randy Binner","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kai Pan","Good morning. First question is on the pricing, slight uptick in the second quarter. Could you give a little bit more granularity in term by lines or by count size, what do you see underlying sort of trends there in terms of both by - from supply and demand side. And what do you see could potentially be the upside pricing as well as downside to that pricing?","Brian MacLean","Yeah, Kai, so this is Brian. I\u2019ll start, a couple of broad dynamics. Not surprisingly, Auto was the line where we're seeing the most positive pricing movement. Comp is, I think, the line with the most pressure, and that's, I think, really consistent with workers comp, if you see what\u2019s coming out of NCCI and other competitors, that's not surprising. From an account size perspective, larger accounts under more pressure, so we've talked a lot and others have talked about a large property business. We think that's somewhat consistent with the returns that have been in that business, but some pressures are there, I think, even larger casualty business is under a little more pressure than the middle and small type of business. I don\u2019t think from an industry perspective, there is anything appreciable, but that would be the broad strokes.","Kai Pan","Okay. Then a follow-up on the reserve side, looks like reserve continued to be strong. And I just want to focus on those three areas. One is that, workers comp released in 2015, is that sort of like - is that too early for a long-term on the business. And secondly, the $82 million environmental charges, looks like we are having those amounts for - at least for the last five to six years, just wondering any, like, why wouldn't you book, if you know the pattern is there, why wouldn't you book a big charge upfront. And then the third piece is a pretty strong, like a bond, especially continue to release that any underlying loss cost trend there will be appreciated. Thank you so much.","Jay Benet","Thanks, Kai. This is Jay Benet. Let\u2019s try to take them in order. So, as far as the workers comp, you're absolutely right, when you have a very long tail line of business, you look very, very carefully at things that happened in the short-term and don't necessarily react to them. In the case of workers\u2019 comp, what you're seeing here is favorable development in 2015 that related to a relatively short component of it relating to medical where medical bills come in quickly, they get resolved quickly, and the assumption that we had put in there for medical inflation was just too high.","So while the line itself is a long tail line, there are components of it that are more short tail, and that's primarily why we reacted to there. As far as the environmental piece is concerned, I think, if you look at us, as well as the industry, you'll see a similar pattern, if you will, of people trying to, at various points in time, estimate what the ultimate is going to be for environmental losses, and recognizing that you're dealing with something that is a very difficult kind of reserve to truly evaluate. So, in doing so, you have to make various assumptions as to what the future is going to look like in terms of new claims, new policyholders, what the average frequency and severity might be associated with things that have been reported or not reported.","And it's those assumptions that you're constantly updating as time goes on. So what we disclosed, I\u2019ll point you to the 10-Q, what we disclosed this year is actually very similar to what we've disclosed in prior periods and what you've seen other companies disclose that there really hasn't been a change in the environment per se, things have gotten a little better, but the rate of them getting better has just been less than - previously assumed or hoped for, and that's a chunk of the reserve addition.","In addition to that, we\u2019re always subject to judicial rulings or other things to take place episodically in various jurisdictions. There was one that came out of the Northwest, increased modestly, some of our claim cost there that we also recognized.","And then finally, on the Bond & Specialty, this was a quarter for a fairly large prior reserve development benefit. I wouldn't say there was anything unusual about it. This is, as you know, it's a high severity low frequency business. It's one where information emerges slowly. As it emerges, you're always evaluating whether or not it's blossomed to a level where you really feel action is appropriate. So, there are things that have been taking place whether it's in items related to the financial crisis or whatever that we\u2019ve been watching, but things got to a point this quarter where we recognized that it was appropriate to take some reserve action. It wasn't any one product line, it wasn't any one particular claim or things like that, it was pretty much spread across the whole Management Liability and Surety book of business.","Kai Pan","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Nannizi","Thanks so much. Can you talk a little bit about, when we talked about non-cat weather in BI and Personal Auto.? Can you talk about non-cat weather in homeowners\u2019 book and how that has looked recently?","Brian MacLean","Michael, this is Brian, again. In this quarter, similarly there was some, but not to the same degree. So just to quantify this, as I said about a point on the Auto side, it was probably about half-a-point on the Personal Property side of some impact there, so some, but not as dramatic of that, again, that specifically the PCS event.","Michael Nannizi","Got it. I guess I am just curious because it looks like in the last few quarters, like especially in BI, we've talked about non-cat weather impacting the underlying and sort of a driver for the year-over-year comps being negative. And then in Auto, it looks like it was a factor this quarter as well, but when I look at my estimates and your results over the last several quarters, Homeowners has been consistently better. And I think better even relative to your outlook as you've disclosed in your Qs. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand how - why the impact is potentially disproportionate in these areas, because the nature of the risk is different or reinsurance or something else that's causing non-cat weather to be - it looks like a tailwind in one and potentially a headwind in the others.","Michael Klein","Yeah, Michael, this is Michael Klein. I think what you're seeing is a combination of factors in the Home product and weather is one of them. In the case of this quarter, I think what you see is, to Brian\u2019s point on the net impact, it's a couple of moving parts underneath. You\u2019ve got the weather impact, but we also have sort of underlying experience on fire, non-weather water losses. That again, also fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. So when Brian talked about weather and other normal quarterly fluctuations, that's really what he\u2019s talking about and this quarter was an example of that where we had some other non-cat weather, again, non-weather water, fire experience that came in better than expected. And importantly, for the year-over-year comparison, this quarter, there actually was a significant individual risk fire loss in the second quarter of last year that helps the quarter-over-quarter comparison just to give you a little bit of color on that.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. That's very helpful, thanks. And then, maybe Brian, on BI, so it sounded like from Alan\u2019s comments that the lift in the expense ratio was commissioned related. I'm guessing that means that it should continue, because I'm also just sort of trying to square that, because at 33, no, it\u2019s not, okay.","Brian MacLean","Yeah, the commission - last year in the second quarter, we had a takedown in our contingent commission accrual that reduced the number. So that created a year-over-year kind of difference.","Alan Schnitzer","Yeah. The delta is not really in the base commission, so delta is in these other things that caused quarter-to-quarter variances.","Brian MacLean","Yeah.","Michael Nannizzi","Got it. But I guess my other point is so the 33.3 expense ratio in this quarter, forget the comps, but just the app number this quarter, is that how we should be thinking about, because it sounds like there was some one-offs last year, but this quarter, is that how we should be thinking about the expense ratio from here?","Alan Schnitzer","It's Alan, Michael. I guess I would say that we try not to forecast on these individual pieces, but what I\u2019d suggest is maybe you go back over the last - I don\u2019t know, somewhere between two and four quarters and average the number and maybe use that as sort of a proxy for a go-forward number, but there is always going to be some volatility quarter-to-quarter.","Michael Nannizzi","Okay. Got it. Just because it does scream relatively high when I go back, so it sounds like maybe there is some volatility, I was just trying to understand what drove just some episode of higher expense ratio that should cause that to normalize as you\u2019re sort of suggesting, it should, but maybe I can follow up afterwards. Thanks.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question, please.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ryan Tunis","Hey, thanks. My first question I guess is for Brian. I was just hoping for a little bit more color on what's been driving the solid new business growth in middle markets. I think you mentioned submissions are up, but I guess sort of like over the past couple of quarters that it has been pretty strong and just sort of what you're seeing on the new business front?","Brian MacLean","I think it's a couple of factors. We believe, as I tried to say in my comments, driven by the factor, I think we're in a pretty strong position in the marketplace. We\u2019ve been executing in a very stable and effective way, I think for a long period of time. We've got some real competitive advantages. The overall market is pretty stable, but there has been some pretty well publicized dislocations, and at least a couple of very large carriers had been very open about taking profit, improvement actions, and so that's created some specific opportunities, but I think, we think more broadly, has also created a little bit of a mood in the marketplace of flight to quality.","So like I said, we've seen our submission activity up a decent amount and we've also, consistent with that, been driving a message to our organization, not strategically to do anything different with returns, but to be more active, and to be out there quoting more. So, just to be blunt about it, we're pushing our place pretty hard right now to be real active in the marketplace and get out of the quotes and not compromise on returns, but try to meet the opportunity of the submission activity, and that's been paying off in specifically our core middle market, commercial accounts business and the construction areas.","Alan Schnitzer","Ryan, I would add to that that part of our motivation behind pushing little bit more activities, just where returns are, product returns in the marketplace after five or so years of price increases, and so there is a lot out there that's potentially attractive to us, consistent. This is really important, consistent with our return objectives. So we're not making any compromises on that.","Ryan Tunis","Okay. That makes a lot of sense. I guess my other question was just looking at the margin trajectory in Agency Auto and how to think about that on a go-forward basis. I guess, year-to-date, there have been a couple of things that have been - that seemed to have been weighing on the loss, actually on loss ratio some, is the new business drag, then there is the elevated non-cat weather, but something that we were a little bit - interesting was looking at the 10-Q, it looks like the language looking in to 2017 was that margins would remain kind of where they have been. And I'm just kind of curious, as you lap the elevated new business and you get rid of the lower non-cat weather, why would margins not be improving kind of as you look out into 2017?","Brian MacLean","So I think, just a couple of quick comments and I will pass it to Michael. Certainly, we view that the non-cat weather as episodic, and so we think that should absolutely return to normal levels. On the new business dynamic, the good news is that we continue to write some significant levels of new business through that product. So we feel great that we are building real embedded value in that portfolio, but it is going to take longer. The stronger the production topline is, the longer it is going to take for that to really work through the loss ratio. The other point I'd make is, the Quantum 2.0 product also was designed to have a lower expense ratio and a little bit higher on loss side. So you have to look at the combined in total to get that product. So...","Michael Klein","Brian, if I can just clarify something. One of the things we actually added to the Q this quarter was in the outlook section, we have previously spoken to underlying underwriting margins. So we thought it was important to add combined ratio, because people often use those terms interchangeably. And as you know, the combined ratio is a function of the premium volume, whereas, the margins are just dollars. And just to clarify what we're saying here in the Q is, for Auto, which I think is what we're talking about, the early part of '17, the company expects underlying underwriting margins, the dollars to be slightly higher because of what's taking place with writing higher volumes of business, that's profitable. But writing a higher percentage of new business relative to the base is also causing a slight uptick in the underlying combined ratio. So, you have this feature here where the dollars are going up, at the same time that the combined ratio is going up. So I just wanted to clarify that.","Ryan Tunis","Yes. That\u2019s helpful. I think I was a little bit confused by that. Thanks guys, appreciate it.","Alan Schnitzer","Ryan, the other factor just to know it's not all this new business impact from what we are writing. As Michael explained a second ago, we haven't had this last quarter or so, this favorable non-weather loss activity. And as we also highlighted in 10-Q, we expect that to return to a more normal level. So that's also having on a go-forward basis, a slight adverse impact.","Michael Klein","This is Michael Klein. We\u2019re looking at what is underneath just to reiterate, right, Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced at the same return level as the book of business has been priced to. So it really is the dynamic of preponderance of newer I think of it as younger business, right, the portfolio is getting younger because of the outsized growth that we've seen over the last couple of years. But the long-term return targets for the product will remain consistent with where they have been.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Amit Kumar","Thanks, and good morning. Two quick questions, probably these are follow-ups. And I apologize if I'm still not clear. Just going back to the discussion on BI and what Randy was asking, if you ex out all the moving parts, and just focus on the underlying discussion on the negative loss cost trends versus on pricing, is it episodic as what you're seeing or is this - the usual sort of trend line, i.e., you've talked about this in the past that overtime this equation will get flipped, and now we're at the point where it has flipped. I'm just trying to understand that.","Alan Schnitzer","It's not episodic. There is a trend there, but I think what we've told in the past is, there is some danger to looking at that very narrow definition of rate versus loss trend. And obviously, anybody could look at rate which is sort of around zero and loss trend, which is something north of zero on a written basis, and it has been moving in that direction for some number of quarters, so as anybody as we would've expected, as that earns in over time, there will be some negative pressure on margin. But what we've said in the past is you've got to look at that in the context of all the other moving pieces that impact underlying underwriting margin, things like we have a tax impact year-over-year this quarter, there is expenses, there is base years, there is mix, all those other things go into that number, and what we've shown you this quarter is all that comes out to about a wash. And I guess, I'd also point you to the outlook where we give you a sense of over the next four quarters or so that we would expect underlying underwriting margins obviously subject to the volatility of weather and whatnot to continue to be broadly consistent.","Brian MacLean","The other thing I\u2019d emphasize, this is Brian, is that there's a lot of things in there that we have to react to, and there are other things in there that we are actively managing. And so, you shouldn't have the impression that we are just sitting by, and as Alan just said, pricing is at roughly zero this quarter, rate and loss trend is something north of that that we're just conceding that margins will recede. We are managing our mix, we're taking actions in underwriting selection, we're taking actions in claim execution, which are all impacting our loss trend. And then, we are reacting to weather volatility, et cetera, that might be moving through the business. So there is no denying that the sheer arithmetic of that narrow piece, the loss trend in the rate right now is a negative. We've said in the past that it's relatively modest, and it continues to be relatively modest, and then there are all the other impacts that are going through.","Amit Kumar","Got it. That's a fair comment. The second question I had was just going back to the discussion on Quantum 2.0. In the past, when we\u2019ve talked about loss cost trends, frequency was pecked at 0.5, severity was at 2.5. Has there been any evolution in that number or is it still the same?","Brian MacLean","No. We didn't see anything different in the core underlying trends of what was going on in the Auto book. So we would be at exactly those numbers you just said, about 0.5 frequency, 2.5 severity. And as we\u2019ve said in the Quantum Auto 2.0 specifically, still running consistent with our loss expectations.","Amit Kumar","Yeah, got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Charles Sebaski","Thanks for getting me in. I guess I'd like to follow-up again on, following [indiscernible] Quantum 2.0, and the Agency Auto book, and the clarity. I realized there is an additional disclosure in the Q, but how you guys expect the Auto book to evolve out. I guess, the commentary of early '17 being plus or minus 16, which is plus or minus 15, and you say that you\u2019re underwriting to a same return dynamic. But I guess, this has been a book influx that coming out of 2011 and '12 where it\u2019s been underperforming and the introduction of Quantum 2.0, just where is the run rate on what you should - what we should expect that - there is so many moving parts, but it seemed like there should be a story that was improving, and I guess, the commentary seems to be that it's maybe gotten as good as it's going to get. Is that right?","Brian MacLean","So the message absolutely is not, this is as good as it's going to get. The core from a profitability perspective, let me start with the top line perspective, because what\u2019s the story on Quantum 2.0. We have been pleasantly surprised with the traction the product has gotten in the business in the marketplace. We clearly went in with an expectation that this would enhance growth and we've done better than our original expectations there and you can see the numbers. So we feel good about that. And we are not sure where that's going to go exactly in the future, but we think that we're going to be able to sustain some pretty decent amount of growth going forward.","From the profitability perspective, just as it is true of all business that we've ever written in this product, it matures over the years, and so there's a tenure impact. And as Michael just said, the younger tenured business is typically not as profitable as we write the business where we\u2019re targeting a tenured, longer-term return and we're on track to do that. So as this portfolio matures, and as Quantum 2.0, as we get more and more of the aging of the book, we believe the trend should absolutely be improving profitability on this business.","Charles Sebaski","Okay. I guess, on that, could you give us some additional insight on the tenure, the curing of the Auto book on what is the average policy life for you guys on this? I guess, when I think of some commercial accounts that might be longer, it seems that Auto still is a quick-return product. So this introduction of new growth, which has really been strong, what's the timeline for curing on an Auto book and how long do you average keep Auto policies?","Michael Klein","So, Charles, I don't know that I\u2019ll get into the specifics of the policy life expectancy, et cetera, but to give you a little bit more color, this is Michael, on aging of the Auto book, you have to really think about both components of what's going on here, right. So first, you need to think about a vintage and think about a book of business we're writing to given policy year, and that new business that we write in that term that comes on at a higher loss ratio early, and then as we renew, it improves. If you look at the production statistics that we've been disclosing and the high levels of new business, what's happening inside the portfolio then, which is the second piece, is on average the portfolio is getting younger, right.","And if younger business carries a higher loss ratio, that's what we described as the increase in the combined. So when you look at the outlook for the first half of - or I'm sorry, the second of '16, we see the combined ratio will be higher due to the impact of the higher new business levels we\u2019ve been writing, that is the underlying dynamic that's flowing through the book, that does continue into the first half of '17, it just gets offset by an expectation of return to normalized non-cat weather levels.","And so the underlying dynamic of the book getting younger meaning, less tenured, right, we\u2019ve had the accounts not as long, continues into \u201817, recognize also though that as we write more Quantum Auto 2.0 business, there is a benefit to the combined ratio from an offsetting improvement in the expense ratio, because it carries commissions. So that underlying ageing of the book or reducing average tenure of the book does continue into \u201817, it just gets offset by again an expectation of a return to more normalized weather. That\u2019s why the outlook reads the way it does.","Brian MacLean","It's an assumption, not an expectation.","Michael Klein","I'm sorry, it's an assumption.","Alan Schnitzer","So one of the point on that, so again, as Michael said, we\u2019re not going to give you explicitly the target we have for life expectancy on policies. We think that's part of our competitive kind of conversation. We clearly accept that hitting the expectations of retaining the business is important, which is why in my comments, I emphasized that as we are going into year two and in some cases year three for the Quantum Auto 2.0 product, we feel really good that we are hitting the retention rates we expected. So whatever our expectation was for life expectancy, along with our statement about losses are progressing, so is the retention of the business and you can look at our long-term retention and begin to deduce some kind of policy life expectancy by just doing the arithmetic.","Charles Sebaski","Thank you very much for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. I was hoping to get a bit more insight on the pace of share buybacks. It's slowed over the past few quarters on a linked-quarter basis. And the slowdown in share buybacks was actually a little greater than the reduction in earnings for the first half of 2015 to the first half of 2016. Can you give us a bit more insight on that?","Jay Benet","Yes. Jay, this is Jay. I think you\u2019re looking back at a period of time where, as we\u2019ve said in the past, over time, share buybacks are going to be enabled by earnings and all these pension contributions and whatever, it's the earnings of the place over time that will drive what the total share buybacks and dividends are and what you saw and I think you even ask the question in the past can we continue to buyback at levels that are higher than our earnings, well, this is the flipside of it. This is just an indication of the timing element of when we look and see what the future quarter projections are. They obviously come out to be whatever they will be and we\u2019re just taking the numbers in the particular quarter that we\u2019re doing the share buybacks over a longer term view to say in this particular quarter, 550 sounds like the right number. So I wouldn't read anything into it in terms of a change in philosophy or a change in execution, it's just going to be the, what we\u2019d refer to as the normal quarterly variation and the policy and a discipline that's been set for a long period of time.","Jay Gelb","I see. Okay. Thank you for that. Second one, what was the overall impact in the combined ratio in 2Q from non-cat weather? On a combined ratio basis?","Alan Schnitzer","We are looking.","Jay Gelb","Okay. While you're - if you have that number. I also wanted to ask about - I know the UK leave vote is not significant relative to Travelers in its overall business, but if you have any thoughts on that, I think that would be real helpful for us.","Alan Schnitzer","Sure. In terms of BREXIT, the most significant impact to us would be whatever it means for the overall economic activity, the amount of premium that we write out of the UK that relies on passporting is very, very small, it\u2019s something like 5% of our overall international premium and about half of that is to Lloyd\u2019s and we assume that one way or another, Lloyd\u2019s will address the passporting issue as will we by the way. A long way to go to see how that's going to work out and what the ultimate arrangements are going to be, but other than the overall macro impact, we don't expect any significant impact to us.","Jay Gelb","Appreciate that, Alan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","Paul Newsome","Good morning. And congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask about the competitive landscape in the personal lines business. We've had a few management changes of recent note, like places at Progressive and State Farm. I'm wondering if the components of who is being competitive out there have changed in the last year.","Michael Klein","Yes, Paul. This is Michael Klein. I would say broadly speaking, the answer to that question is no, I mean, competitive dynamics are very local in the business as well. And so while there have been changes in management at some national competitors and frankly, some local regionals as well, the broad competitive dynamics in the business remain consistent, when we look at the rate filing monitoring that we do in the business to assess the rates that carry and take in particular states in auto or home. We don't see a lot of shift in behavior there. So I would say the competitive dynamics are broadly consistent.","Paul Newsome","So, the general idea that the agency folks keep losing share and the regionals and the direct people are the most competitive? Is that still kind of really the case?","Michael Klein","I think if you look at the latest A.M. Best data, you continue to see some incremental shift in share by channel. Interestingly, I think consistent with the last couple of years, the majority of the games you are seeing in the sort of online direct channel are actually coming from captive and less and less from independent agency, but broadly I think those trends continue.","Paul Newsome","Great, thanks. Appreciated.","Jay Benet","This is Jay Benet. Somebody asked the question about what was the impact on the combined ratio of non-cat weather. And one thing, I will give you the number but I also have to give a little bit of a preface to it. Now, we are parsing things very thin here and talking strictly about that. So if you have the question what's the impact of non-cat weather on a combined ratio on a consolidated basis, we would say 150 basis points. But I\u2019d also point out that if you ask the question about well what about other losses that goes in a different direction and what about mix and that goes in a different direction. So we will answer your question but there is lots and lots of things that are taking place here that makes the one number not necessarily indicative of the trends or of what's going to or what the expectation is. So I would just urge you to go back to the Q and the outlook to see what all of this to us actually translates into.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Jay Cohen","Just to follow up, the language in the Q on the commercial - on the business insurance segment, you extended the commentary on the margin into 2017. Again, the broadly consistent language, I assume that\u2019s largely because of the first half of \u201816 at a high level of loss activity non-cat weather, is that fair?","Alan Schnitzer","That\u2019s right there are some large losses in non-cat weather that in the outlook we would expect to return to normal levels, we would assume.","Jay Cohen","Got it. Thanks and then the second question may be for Bill Heyman because he hasn\u2019t had a chance to speak yet. Obviously, as we would expect the non-fixed income returns are always going to be variable. Can you give us a sense given how the portfolio is constructed today, what is an expected return for that portfolio at this point?","Bill Heyman","Thanks Jay, I think an expected return for non-fixed income ought to be in the high single digits pre-tax. If you look at this quarter, we made a bit more real estate then we figured, real estate has two components rentals from properties we own, and NII from real estate funds. Hedge funds were below what we expected but positive and the big variable was private equity where the portfolio was almost flat maybe few million dollars and we would have expected about $50 million pre-tax. Now what\u2019s interesting is the cash flow from that portfolio has remained at historical levels. And it typically hasn\u2019t contained as much NII in the past. So, we still we would aim for a double-digit pre-tax return on these assets and if we didn't feel we can do that we probably would reduce our allocation. But I think a fair expectation is high-single digits pre-tax.","Gabriella Nawi","And the next question will be our last question. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Larry Greenberg with Janney. Please go ahead.","Larry Greenberg","And I apologize for going back to this but I mean just listening to some of the chatter that\u2019s out there this morning, there is something of a view that you guys elaborating on the pricing lost trend relationship in business insurance suggests that you\u2019re seeing or thinking something new. And if I hear what you're saying it really doesn't appear to be the case and I just want to be sure that I\u2019ve got that right.","Alan Schnitzer","Larry, it's Alan. Let me be very clear about this there is nothing that\u2019s changed there is nothing that\u2019s surprising us and everything is consistent with what we\u2019ve reported to you on a written basis over the last four quarters. The real reason we put it in there is we wanted to be completely transparent, it\u2019s a very small piece but we thought gee, if we didn't put it in there, you or somebody would have said to us, gee, how can this not be happening because we are looking at your written numbers over the last three or four quarters. So I\u2019ll just reiterate it\u2019s small, it's within our expectations, it wraps up with all the other things that are typically moving around in a quarter, it\u2019s about a wash in terms of the year-over-year impact and nothing - no message intended in terms of anything out of the ordinary, completely expected, completely consistent with what we've seen on a written basis and we continue to be very pleased with the model of returns on the business that we're writing.","Larry Greenberg","And then just my follow up, Jay in your discussion on non-renewing that cat on, I think you said that the reason was due to your current risk profile and I'm just curious about that comment and if you could elaborate a little bit on that?","Jay Benet","Primarily our cat program is one that products capital not one that really deals with income protection, if you look at where limits are and things of that sort and where the attachment points are, it's pretty high up there. So in any given period, we\u2019re looking at the entirety of it, where our property exposures are and just given the way the book has evolved over the last few years, we just felt that this wasn't really adding much on a risk versus cost basis so we decided not to renew it.","Gabriella Nawi","Great, that's it. It concludes our call for today, as always we at investor relations are available for follow-up questions. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today, we thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect all lines.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, July 23, 2013. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you, Andre. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our second quarter 2013 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.","Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions.","Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.","And now, Jay Fishman.","Jay S. Fishman","Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","We're very pleased with our results this quarter, posting record net income per share of $2.41. We are particularly gratified that this is another quarter which demonstrates the very successful execution of the pricing strategy in commercial lines, which we embarked on nearly 3 years ago. Our granular active approach to improving profitability has been very successful. The aggregate rate and retention data that we showed -- that we show you for our commercial businesses demonstrate the success, but the data underneath tells an even more powerful story of improvement in profitability. This is important, and Brian will take you through that in more detail.","But let me share with you that underlying margin improvement in our commercial businesses since 2011, which we achieved primarily through earned rate, our renewal business exceeding loss trend has, as of now, generated an increase in after-tax operating income of $650 million on an annualized basis. If we include Personal Insurance, and more to say on personal lines in a minute, the increase is more than $1 billion.","Importantly, we have done so without disruption to our agents or customers. The relevant question now is where do we go from here?","Since 2005, we have maintained a financial goal of producing a mid-teens operating return on equity over time. The over time aspect of the goal allows us to maintain the objective even when conditions are such that returns at that level are not immediately achievable on an accident year basis such as now. If you adjust our year-to-date operating return on equity of 15% to more of an accident year look by excluding the impact of net favorable prior year development, as well as the impacts of the favorable tax and legal resolutions, the adjusted ROE is approximately 8.5%.","Also, to achieve a mid-teens operating ROE over time, there will be years where we must exceed the target because there will be other years when, due to any number of factors, we will fall below. So it is clear that we have more work to do to achieve our objective, and as a consequence, our strategy remains intact. We will continue to execute for improved returns, just as we have been doing.","In Personal Insurance, we have also had a strategy of improving profitability through higher pricing. What has become apparent to us in the auto insurance line is that the combination of the rapid adoption of the comparative rater technology in independent agents offices, which now is the source of the substantial amount of the quotes that we issue and changing consumer expectations for this product have impacted our new business volume meaningfully.","Consequently, we have concluded that to improve profitability and to create long-term value, we must have a more competitively priced product. By leveraging technology and taking other actions, we will make substantive changes to our business processes that we expect will allow us to meaningfully reduce costs without impacting service or quality.","Brian will take you through the details, but through these actions we expect to be able to more competitively price our product and improve our profitability. Before I hand it over to Jay, I'd like to comment on our announcement in June that we agreed to acquire the Dominion of Canada. This was a strategic move, providing us with meaningful scale and market position in Canada. We are enthusiastic about the opportunity and are looking forward to welcoming the Dominion employees to Travelers.","With that, let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay S. Benet","Thanks very much, Jay. Let me start by saying how pleased we all are with the second quarter and year-to-date results. And I do want to correct one thing Jay said, on Page 21 of the webcast, we do have a reconciliation of the operating return on equity year-to-date as reported of 15%. And when you do adjustment in net favorable prior year development and the favorable tax and legal settlements, it's actually 11.5%, would be -- what we consider to be the accident year kind of run rate of that. But with that, our liquidity and capital positions remain very strong, and we continue to generate capital in excess of what we need to support our businesses. Operating cash flows of approximately $722 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion year-to-date were also very strong, notwithstanding the cat losses that remain very high relative to historical standards although it's significantly below the corresponding prior year periods.","We maintained our strong cash position, ending the quarter with holding company liquidity of just over $2 billion, after returning $491 million of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $191 million and common share repurchases of $300 million. Our strategy of returning excess capital to our shareholders remains unchanged. As we've stated in the past, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed operating income over time. And in any given period, the difference between operating income and the level of dividends and share repurchases will also be a matter of timing. I'd remind you also the amount of common share repurchases will also depend on a variety of additional factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the company's ratings, our share price, pension funding needs, strategic initiatives and other market conditions.","We've included an overview of our cat reinsurance coverage on Page 20 of the webcast, which has been structured in a way that is generally consistent with the prior year.","Effective May 16, we entered into another 3-year reinsurance agreement with long-term -- Long Point Re III in which they issued $300 million of cat bonds, providing us with Northeast hurricane coverage on a specified -- on specified lines of business subject to a $1.25 billion retention, after which we can recover up to $300 million on a proportional basis until covered losses reach $1.8 billion.","Effective July 1, we renewed our gen cat treaty with terms that look similar to last year, an attachment point of $1.5 billion and with covered losses of up to $400 million within the $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion level -- layer.","Also effective July 1, we renewed our $600 million Northeast gen cat treaty with the same $2.25 billion attachment point as in the prior year. Given the current reinsurance pricing environment, all of this was accomplished at a cost that was lower than the prior year. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage, which also includes a description of our gen cat aggregate excess of loss treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences, is included on our second quarter 10-Q, which we filed earlier today, as well as in our 10-K. All of our capital ratios remained at or better than our target levels, and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-total capital ratio of 20.1%. Due to the recent rise in interest rates, net unrealized investment gains decreased by $1.2 billion after-tax in the quarter, driving a 2% reduction in book value per share in the quarter or 1% year-to-date.","This impact of higher interest rates more than offset the very positive impact on book value per share of our strong earnings, which was the major driver of the change in adjusted book value per share. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, increased 3% during the quarter and 5% year-to-date. I would note that the rise in interest rate does have a positive side. Going forward, if interest rates stay at their current levels, we'll be able to reinvest proceeds from maturing bonds at higher yields than we were previously assuming. I would point out though that at current interest rate levels, this will still result in a reduction in future net investment income, just not as much. The rise in interest rates also led to an $87 million after-tax realized investment gain this quarter due to our use of U.S. Treasury futures to shorten the duration of the investment portfolio. At the beginning of the year, given the interest rate environment and the economic outlook, we decided to increase our short position from its then nominal amount of $800 million. The position was increased to $2 billion by the end of the first quarter and further increased to as much as $2.7 billion before the position was closed by the end of the second quarter due to our outlook for interest rates versus the carrying cost of this strategy.","Lastly, I'd also like to point out that the rise in interest rates has not been significant enough to impact our pricing strategy in any meaningful way.","So Brian is now going to provide some further comments on operating results.","Jay S. Fishman","Jay, just let me interrupt one second, if I may. I understand I misspoke and I know you corrected it, but because it is so important, please just let me reiterate that the adjusted ROE on what I described as the more of an accident look is 11.5%. If I said 8.5%, it was indeed just simply an error on my part. It's 11.5%. Thank you. Brian, I apologize.","Brian W. MacLean","No problem. Thanks, Jay. I'll go right to the segment results, beginning with Business Insurance, where we continue to be extremely pleased with the fundamentals of the business.","The combined ratio for the quarter of 96.2% improved nearly 7 points versus the prior year, while the underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year development, improved over 3 points.","Looking at production results for the segment on Page 9, retention and renewal premium change were both strong and in line with recent periods at 80% and nearly 9%, respectively, while new business volume was down slightly from the first quarter. Over the last 6 quarters, the production trends have been remarkably stable with retention running consistently around 80%, renewal price change between 8 and 10 points and rate around 7% to 8%.","Slides 10 through 12 show a basically similar story of consistency for each of the businesses within the segment, and in each case, the compounding effect of rate increases is driving a meaningful improvement in our combined ratios. So the aggregate production results remain strong but as we've mentioned many times, the aggregate numbers alone don't tell the entire story. In fact, the detail of where we are getting the rate and what accounts we are retaining is key to evaluating the success of our pricing strategy.","On Slide 13, we show our commercial accounts rate change and retention data for the second quarter of 2013 as compared to the second quarter of 2012. The data is segmented by the individual account's long-term loss ratios, with the bars on the left representing our best-performing accounts and the bars on the right representing our worst performing accounts.","We've shown this data before and I want to emphasize that it's a summarized version and the analytics we actually used to manage the business are at a much more granular level. The results show that for our better accounts, retention was very strong and rate change was solid and consistent with the year ago. For our core performing business, rate increases were up significantly year-over-year while retention was down meaningfully.","Additionally, as you evaluate our results, keep in mind that our rate actions over the past 3 years have improved the returns in each of these loss ratio bands. So in fact, although the aggregate pricing improvements are very consistent over the past 6 quarters, an analysis of the underlying data reveals that our execution has, in fact, improved over time and is contributing to higher levels of profitability. So overall, in Business Insurance, very encouraging picture. The earned impact of these rate gains, along with loss trend across the segment that continues to run at about 4%, drove meaningful margin expansion. Going forward, our emphasis is continue to improve returns through maximizing the rate and retention trade-off at a very granular level.","In Financial, Professional & International Insurance, operating income for the quarter was down 15% year-over-year due to higher catastrophe losses and less favorable prior year development. The cat losses in the quarter were primarily due to the unprecedented flooding in Alberta, Canada. Excluding cats and prior year development, the underlying combined ratio of 89.9% for the segment was strong and improved more than 2 points year-over-year. This improvement was driven largely by expanding margins in our Management Liability business, along with the impact of recent underwriting initiatives across the segment. Written premium was up slightly compared to the prior year quarter, driven by strong surety results, continued favorable rate in Management Liability and new business in international, partially offset by higher levels of written [ph] premiums.","In June, we were pleased to announce our agreement to acquire the Dominion of Canada. The combined business will benefit from Travelers' sophistication in the use of data and analytics, as well as claim and risk control capabilities. The Dominion's extensive distribution network provides us with an exceptional platform for expanding our commercial lines business in Canada. In combining Travelers of Canada surety, Management Liability and commercial middle market products with the Dominion's commercial and personal portfolios, we'll create an organization with significant product breadth and a balanced mix of business. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2013, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.","In Personal Insurance, operating income was up significantly versus the second quarter of 2012 due to lower levels of catastrophe losses and higher underlying underwriting margins. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter showed a 3-point improvement year-over-year with about 2 points driven by earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends.","Looking specifically at Auto production trends, retention of 80% and renewal premium change of over 8% were both in line with recent periods. Net written premium and new business volumes were down year-over-year as a result of our pricing actions.","Turning to Auto profitability. The underlying combined ratio of 96.4% was an improvement of over 1 point versus the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the earned impact of the rate -- written rate gains we have achieved over the past several quarters. Loss cost trends for Auto remain consistent with recent quarters, with mix adjusted frequency continuing to be benign and severity stable at a slightly elevated level. Specifically, bodily injury severity this quarter remained in line with what we've seen in the previous 3 quarters.","In Homeowners, pricing was also very strong, with renewal premium change coming in at over 11%. Retention was consistent at 83%, while new business volume was down slightly from the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio for Home was 81.5% in the quarter, an improvement of over 3 points year-over-year. The improvement was driven by a lower level of non-cat weather losses, along with earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends. So a very strong underwriting result, and we are beginning to see the positive impact of our underwriting and pricing actions.","So overall, a very good quarter. But as Jay mentioned in his opening comments, the personal auto marketplace is changing. We remain committed to offering a product that is both competitively priced and delivers an appropriate return for our shareholders. And accordingly, we are taking expense reduction actions that will allow us to improve both pricing competitiveness and product returns.","Specifically, we expect to reduce our claim and other insurance expenses, such that we realize a savings of $140 million pretax when fully implemented. This represents about a 10% reduction in our unallocated claim and other insurance expense base in Personal Insurance. We will begin realizing some of these savings immediately and they will be fully realized in 2015. The savings will be achieved through the consolidation of certain operations, along with other efficiency gains throughout the business.","The majority of the savings will be driven by staff reductions, primarily through attrition, but we will also be giving notice to approximately 450 employees this week. We expect to take a restructuring charge of about $16 million, $10 million of which is expected to be incurred in the third quarter of 2013. While some of these savings will be realized in our Homeowners business, the majority of the impact will be in Auto, and these actions are clearly aimed at improving our strategic position in that line. We are pleased with the progress we've made in the personal lines business and we believe these actions will allow us to offer an even more competitive product in a challenging marketplace.","I'll now turn it over to Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you, Brian. Before we open it for questions, I'd like to note that the management team is participating from several different locations this morning, so please bear with us as we coordinate our responses. With that, Andre, can we open it up for questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Two quick questions. First, it relates to pricing. In terms of the Business Insurance pricing trends, I'm looking at the renewal rate change. Do you think, based on where we are and what rates we have achieved in the past, does the RRC and Business Insurance, does it stay somewhat flattish from here? Or does it change meaningfully from here?","Brian W. MacLean","So let me start. This is Brian MacLean. Let me start with an answer and then, Jay or Jay, chime in. I -- the first observation I'd make is when we look at the actual results, so we're not going to go far out in the crystal ball world, but if we look at the actual results over the last 6 quarters, from Page 10, it's incredibly stable. The red line there of renewal rate change is basically rounding off of 7.5% for all of those quarters. So what we saw in the quarter was very consistent with where we've been. Our view about it -- I would want to emphasize what we said in the presentation, that we don't have a target and it's not necessarily about attaining a specific level of rate gain, it's about achieving returns. So we're looking very granularly and obviously trying to retain the best business and drive the price increases on the weaker stuff. There can be a -- next quarter, a rate change number identical to the one that we just have, which might be generating much better returns or much worse, depending on where you get it. So we're very focused on the segmentation. As far out as we're going to go is what we saw in the quarter was very consistent. June was a pretty strong month. July looks like it's trending pretty consistently, but where the market's going to be in 3, 4, 5 months, we'll all see. But we haven't seen anything in our results that would say that the market is about to shift dramatically and the fundamental situation with interest rates and weather volatility continues.","Jay S. Fishman","Brian, would you agree that over the last 3 years as more of the Commercial Business has moved from the right side to the left side, and as a consequence, more as in the higher margin rather than the lower margin business? That achieving a flat rate in that same environment is actually net underneath an actual improvement.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. And what you mean by flat rate is 7.5% round number rate increase?","Jay S. Fishman","Correct. It's really the rate applied to the mix that is the important factor here.","Brian W. MacLean","Right. When we look at our granular execution and the impact of now a couple of years of rate increases on the portfolio, we feel the round numbers, 80% retention, 7.5% rate we're getting today, is producing a much better result than the 80% and 7.5% renewal rate change we were getting 1.5 years ago. So we feel very good about it.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Got it. That's helpful. I'm sorry, go ahead.","Brian W. MacLean","I was just going to say, but don't see any major shifts in what's going on in the market.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Yes. One quarter does not make a trend, but we'll see. The only other question I had is on...","Jay S. Fishman","I will just make an observation. It's not one quarter. It's been a lot of quarters. And just an observation as to the data. That's all.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Yes. The other question was on Dominion, Dominion's business mix and a combined ratio. And I know it's a bit too early. Just looking at their business mix and their combined ratios, could you just sort of broadly talk about what your strategy might be and how it might differ versus the current strategy?","Alan D. Schnitzer","Sure. Amit, it's Alan Schnitzer. But when you're talking about the current strategy, I'm not sure exactly which one you're asking.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","I'm talking about the combined ratios, 106.1% for 2012, and their top line is $1.2 billion. Just sort of broader thoughts on that going forward. How does that change? Does it change near term? Or does it take somewhat longer to turn that around?","Alan D. Schnitzer","Sure. Let me take a stab at that. So stepping back, the transaction really is a strategic transaction for us. It gives us important scale and competitive position in a big market that currently we're -- we don't have either in. So from a strategic perspective, we think it's important. In terms of what's driving that combined ratio, a lot of that is their personal lines Auto business. And we think that when we bring our data and analytics and claim expertise to that marketplace, we can -- and it'll take some time, but we think we can substantially improve that result. Also, they've got a small commercial platform that we like a lot. We think we can bring our expertise and analytics from that business into that marketplace. And one of the real benefits for us in this transaction is that they've got a terrific distribution platform in Canada, and we like the opportunity to expand our commercial middle market products through their distribution. So we think that there is good premium growth in the platform from that. So -- and looking overall in international, we've been, certainly over the last couple of years, focused on investing in that business and managing the loss side, which we've done very effectively over the last couple of years. So we're very confident that when we apply that same expertise to the Dominion, we'll be able to have positive effects on that. One of the impacts of what we've been doing for a couple of years is the expense ratio has ticked up, both from investing in people and data and analytics and also from, over the years, having shed some premium that didn't meet the risk and reward calculation for us. So the additional volume that comes on from Dominion really helps us from the expense side as well. So that's really sort of the outlook and the strategic positioning of the transaction.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In regards to margins, in the press release, I noticed that low levels of large losses were cited at -- within the international segment. And I also noticed that lower levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses were cited in personal lines. So I guess, does that mean we should build some margin cushion into our forward estimates given non-cat level large losses have been running below historical averages? Or am I thinking about that wrong -- the wrong way?","Jay S. Benet","Yes. This is Jay Benet. As we've said in previous quarters, any individual quarter is going to be impacted by things that go well beyond the general flow of earned rate versus what you'd consider to be the underlying loss trend. Now we spike out at least verbally because that's probably as good as it's going to get. We have things like large loss activity and some view as to, with the non-cat weather, favorable or unfavorable relative to the prior year and we try to give you that perspective. What we always suggest you do is look at the longer-term view as to what the combined ratio looks like x cat and few ID [ph], and with those words around and what others say, try to get a view as to what the weather looks like and build that into your models. I hope that's helpful because that's probably as granular as we can get with it.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Yes, it just stood out because I know in 2Q of last year, you also cited lower levels of large losses.","Jay S. Benet","Yes, because the other thing you could do is we wrestle with this as well. So we try to put some words into the outlook within the 10-Q that might also be helpful.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. Last question, in regards to investment income levels. I noticed the portfolio's average pretax yield actually rose a bit sequentially to 3.9%. And I think you cited duration increasing. Can you comment on how we should perspectively think about those dynamics, given the recent increases in new money rates?","William H. Heyman","Well, I think what -- it's Bill Heyman. I'd go first to what Jay said earlier and that is the recent increase in market rates obviously permits us to put new money out at better rate than we were before, but still at rates below the book yields on maturing securities. So I think I would simply take the projections which Jay has made in the past of net investment income going out 2, 3, 4 years and tweak them for this increase in rates, and frankly, I wouldn't tweak them much. If this is -- if what we have seen in June is all we're going to see in 2013 and some will think that may be the case, I wouldn't make major changes in projections.","Jay S. Benet","Yes, if I could add a couple of things. The -- we talked about the short position in treasury futures. And by eliminating that at the end of the quarter, that had an impact of slightly expanding the duration of the portfolio. Having said that, too the rise in interest rates also expands the duration of the portfolio, given the expected impact on bonds that would be called or not called under that circumstance. So the change in duration is really not a structural change at all in the portfolio. And as Bill just said, the rise in interest rates would have a fairly moderate impact on the reinvestment yields so -- given how much is rolling over versus what's enforced. And in our 10-Q, in the outlook section, we talk about all of this having an impact that would suggest about $25 million less in after-tax net investment income off of the fixed income portfolio per quarter going forward, if interest rates stay where they are, and I think before we said the out number was about $30 million. So it's a relatively modest impact.","Jay S. Fishman","And Jay, I would just make some one observation. You just -- you mentioned in passing that the gain was attributable to closing the position. That's actually not completely correct because it's a mark-to-market position, so whether we had closed it or not closed it, the gain would have been there. We closed it because of our expectations of interest rates and the relative cost of carrying the position. But the position is a daily mark-to-market position.","Jay S. Benet","That's entirely right. Thanks for correcting that, Jay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So obviously, we've all been very impressed for the past couple of years with your pricing leadership, pricing approaching, I guess, 20% at this point. You've helpfully done the math for us in 11% or 12% x your ROE. And there's obviously still some pricing yet to earn in and rates are moving higher and so I think we're all sort of sitting out here just scratching our heads, trying to figure out how much longer pricing will continue. You've given us some guidance, which is helpful in your Q. And I'm wondering if you can just expand the math a bit and give us a sense when you've actually worked with your actuaries and meet with your insurance regulators, and share them with your indications, how much more rate in some of your major segments do you actually need to take at these levels?","Jay S. Benet","Jay, you want to start or...","Jay S. Fishman","Yes, I was just taking about how to do that. First, I -- we've always said that one of the things we can't do is to, in any way, is to project or speculate competitive reactions. So just because we articulate pretty clearly what we intend to do, it certainly doesn't mean that it's going to happen or that we approach it with that certainty. But nonetheless, we continue to have a space to go. We've been saying for the longest time, and I take some pride in the fact that the objective, the financial objective, that we articulated now some 8 years ago is one that we stayed with consistently. It's not been remanufactured to be convenient to the environment. It is what we think long-term returns in our business should be and hopefully can be again. But our goal is to get back to the mid-teens return on equity over time, and at 11.5% now on an accident year basis, round numbers, we still have a ways to go. Not all products are the same, very important. Not all businesses are the same. And as a consequence, not all pricing strategies are the same. We talk all the time about the analytic grid that demonstrates high to low returns and our emphasis on pricing relative to that. But every time you take a step up, it changes, whether you're talking about an individual product line like Workers' Comp or property or whether you're talking about a particular business like construction versus our surety business. So the strategies are all quite different and they are all return-driven. But in the aggregate, we are going to continue to push as long as we can, until such time as we bring ourselves back to the long-term objective. And I think that's probably about as clear as we can be. I -- we've resisted, even internally setting artificial goals or targets or budgets, and rather always look at what we've always articulated as our long-term goals to be.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. So 2 things that I would add because, Josh, in your question, you put in there rates moving. I would just point out that the rate movement that we just saw in interest rate has really had virtually no impact on our pricing, and to some degree, because it was a relatively small move in rates. But even the 100 basis points, at one point in time, at the 10 year got a lot of play. The duration of our liability is significantly shorter than that. So you have to look at the whole yield curve and see where rates are moving. So that has had minimal impact. And we'd need quite a bit of movement in interest rates before started changing pricing significantly. And the other...","Jay S. Fishman","We -- actually, Brian, just in that regard, we asked, and I do think these 2 comments are important, most of our, call it, free cash, I don't mean to define that term, but most of our free cash is used in buying back share. So if you look at our portfolio position over the last several years, it's actually been relatively flat. And most of our investing is reinvesting. And so we're not -- it's not as if we're deploying significant amounts of new cash, we've been deploying it in buying back shares. We did ask our actuaries to make an estimate of what a 100 basis point increase would be in the entire curve if there was a shift because, of course, every product is invested -- the underlying products have a duration philosophy is tied to the -- that's tied to the asset. They're not directly matched but it's very much a philosophical match. And this is just an estimate and I perhaps even would call it a guesstimate. But in terms of returns, the equivalent of 100 basis point move in the yield curve would be about 2 to 3 points in pricing rate. So 2 to 3 points in price would be equivalent in returns to 100 basis point move in the entire yield curve. Brian, am I recalling that correctly?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, that's correct.","Jay S. Fishman","Yes.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. The other quick thing I'd point out is that weather volatility is still there. And although our second quarter cat number was dramatically less than what we have seen the last 2 years, it is dramatically higher than what 3 years ago we would have said was historical second quarter norms. So that is still out there and the marketplace needs to deal with it. So that's kind of our view.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's very helpful, Jay, Brian. Just one other question on strategy and distribution evolution. So your comments about the evolution of comparative raters, agents starting to use them for renewal business as well start to get sort of -- raise a whole bunch of questions and it's not obviously as good for the agents or -- and certainly more challenging for the company. I'm wondering if you can talk about how you think that your sort of broader sort of agency strategy evolves more if there's going to be changes in commissions or if you fundamentally try to change your position or approach to that market? And then just more broadly related to that same point, is this something that sort of starts in Auto and then moves to Home and moves the Select and ultimately as sort of a Pandora's box once it's opened?","Brian W. MacLean","So let me -- this is Brian. Let me start with a couple of comments, and then Jay. And I'll go to your last comment first, Josh, which is, clearly, we look at this and say it doesn't have to be just a personal auto dynamic, but complexity of product is really significant in being able to build an efficient rater technology and business process. So even Homeowners is fairly more complicated than Auto and you get into the commercial products and much more complicated than Auto. So we watch it closely but we don't think we're on the verge of comparative raters everywhere. And then I'd say the big backdrop to the question is we're not looking at a fundamental shift across the board of how we deal with independent agents. One of the great strengths of our franchise is the position that we have with agents, and we have a lot of products and we have a lot of breadth and we're going to continue to leverage that, working with them closely on what their business process is and how we continue to together bring a value proposition to the customers is important. With that said, everything is on the table where we're constantly looking it all, the dimensions of it, but we feel good about where we are with agents. Jay?","Jay S. Fishman","Yes, I know, I'd -- just an observation. I think we have a well-deserved and well-earned reputation for being a low-cost-oriented company. We know from experience, I think, how to do that thoughtfully and in the best interest of the business. I think Brian's comment is right. We're determined to be successful in the business. We have an $8 billion premium combined personal lines business, and in fact, everything is on the table. But we do know how to do this. And the comparative rating technology, I get asked all the time, is the product becoming a commodity? And I'm always quick to answer, no. A commodity is a product where the only thing that doesn't matter is the price because all the prices are the same. Every -- oil, the price is the same. And that's not the case here. There are value differentiations and value perceptions and strength to agents and strength to customers, and there are differentiations. What the rater is doing, though, clearly, is increasing price competitiveness at the point-of-sale. The technology has introduced the ability of agents to see greater multiples of prices much more easily. And we do think that the onslaught of advertising over the last, and this is just an opinion, I can't prove it as a fact, but the onslaught of advertising in the space over the last 10 years has brought customers to the view that value is a more important component value dollars of the purchase than perhaps it was previously. So it's going to force a greater level of price competition and I think we're up to the task. And that's what we're going to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So one question I had for, I guess, maybe for Brian first is, just looking -- I know we look at this on a year-over-year basis but sequentially, the combined -- the underlying combined in business was up a bit. And then -- and even going back and looking at 1Q to 2Q, it's not clear that the second quarter is always higher than the first. And even if we'd look at year-over-year, I mean, you're 400 basis points better in the first quarter, 300 basis points-ish better here in the second. Just trying to understand that -- was non-cat weather an element of that comparison? Or any color there on kind of the margin in Business Insurance?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, Mike. I think there's always -- as Jay Benet was saying before, there's always volatility in the individual quarters. Nothing fundamental with the trend has changed over where we were with first quarter. And I know deltas have shifted a little bit. If you look at our data on Page 9, 3.1 points of underlying combined ratio better than last year and the first quarter was better than that. That was the movement in those other things. So we're going to have large losses go up or down or non-cat weather go up or down relative to the previous quarter. I think that we're still in the same place we were in the first quarter, where we think the core underlying margins here in BI are improving somewhere between 2.5 and 3 points for the business. And that is unchanged from where we were in first quarter. And everything has been, as I said before, pretty stable, both rate and loss trend there. So we don't see any fundamental shift. I know the numbers do move around a little bit.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. And I'm just trying to understand given -- so that's great. So the 2.5 to 3 points remain so you had some noise maybe in second quarter. But is it possible to just give some parentheses around the rate-driven margin expansion that you saw in the first quarter versus the second quarter? Just because -- again, I mean, this is the first -- I mean, we've had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 consecutive quarters of sequential improvement in that underlying combined...","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, that's -- I think what I was trying to say, Mike, is the rate-driven margin improvement is the 2.5 to 3. When we try to back out the quarterly periodic volatility and what's the impact of the rate we're earning in versus the core loss trend, that continues to run at 2.5, 3 combined ratio points. And again, you have to do the arithmetic to get the -- just bring it through the combined ratio to get the math to work.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, great. And then, I guess, one question on the actions in personal lines. Any thought around in this process, the direct business, and kind of cost rationalization or continued investment on that front?","Jay S. Fishman","The decision is certainly not being driven by the direct business, but the direct business will most certainly benefit from a lower priced product. So it will certainly help in that regard. I do want to reemphasize, so that everyone understands clearly, that the intention here is to lower cost and increase profitability. So the reduction in cost will, in effect, not be passed on entirely to the price of the product. Some of it will be retained in the form of improved profit. At least that's the plan. So it'll help. It'll certainly help the direct business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the personal lines segment. The policy counts are -- and I mean, you've admitted the policy count declines are pretty stunning and accelerating, it seems, at least this year. Homeowners back to 2006 levels, personal auto back to '04 levels, the direct initiative seems to have stalled. So you guys are losing a lot of share. You've admitted that. What I'm wondering is, is the cost plan enough? In other words, is there -- there's clearly a pricing problem in the marketplace with this segment. So is the cost plan enough such as you can cut your pricing or get more competitive to begin to stem the share losses? And then second is, what's the timing around when we'll see the tangible actions in the P&L from a PIF perspective? I'm sort of wrestling with how long to take the share losses down in my model?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. Let me start, Jay, and then throw it to you and so I'd -- several comments there. And maybe one of the things I'd say right at the front is that the actions we're taking today are somewhat -- the expense actions are somewhat a reaction to what's going on in our top line but more focused on reacting longer term to some changing dynamics in the marketplace. So it's not just a -- because the PIF is down 12%. I would look at -- so a couple of things, number one is...","Jay S. Fishman","Brian, can I also ask you to speak because Greg asked the question with Home, Auto, direct, and I think there is a distinction to be made there as well.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, so let me start with Auto where we -- on the retail auto business through our agent channel. For starters, retentions remain pretty solid and that's been a positive. So although it's down a couple of points, it's still running at a solid level and the shortfall has been in new business. And as we've said and maybe has been obvious, that's clearly been impacted by our pricing action. We feel good that returns have improved, that the -- and 6 months are consistent with our expectations. And our price changes, independent of the expense actions, would -- will be mitigating, as you've seen in the last couple of quarters with the Auto business. So hopefully, that will bring the us back in line. The industry did post the 104.5% combined ratio last year. So it is a product that is needed rate and we feel good about the actions we take. We've taken, we think, the expense actions. And as we said before, anything else that we need to do in this business, everything is on the table, is really -- are really focused on improving that and helping us deal with the changing marketplace. So the Homeowners business, we view as fundamentally different there. We think there are some real capacity issues. That was, I think, much more of a focused weather exposure kind of actions. And so it's not just the pricing we've been driving there, which has fundamentally been driven by the losses, the weather losses, that has been come through. But it's also other actions we've taken from underwriting, deductibles, terms and conditions that have really, really driven us. So we feel very good about where our Homeowners business is right now and feel like we're in a position to move forward. The tricky part of your question is, where do we think the impacts -- well, what's the time horizon? We don't really forecast that out. We're looking at, clearly, a different PIF situation for 2014. But we'll see what that is, okay?","Jay S. Fishman","And just a closing comment on the direct because, Brian, I think you got both of those just right. The dynamic in direct is very much what we've been intending to do. We've been doing a test, a test of pricing sensitivity. And so our -- and people have asked you, your advertising is down. Yes, our advertising is down very intentionally because we've been focused on testing price elasticity in a very limited number of markets and gaining some insight into what that means. So I would just observe that there isn't anything in our direct channel other than also seeing and observing, of course, that pricing really matters, great shock, pricing really matters. And so again, what we're going to do in the personal space here will most -- we hope, we believe, will certainly help the direct channel as well.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, just to follow up on this because the answer is very thorough, but what I'm wrestling with is I love that you're getting good price in the business and the retentions are holding in. So clearly, the core client base is sticking with the Travelers once in the umbrella. Direct is so small. It just seems like -- it's like an experiment, in a way, in the P&L. But really, in the agency side of Homeowners and Auto, it's the lack of the ability to attract new clients in. And I'm wondering if it's more than just the expense side. I'm wondering if it's actually you need to start to ramp advertising a lot more. You need to re-architect the product which you mentioned. I don't know if that costs money. I don't know if that's technology. In other words, I'm just -- I'm trying to wrestle with the cost to fix the new business acquisition engine in the Auto segment and...","Jay S. Fishman","The analytics that we have indicate, maybe even more than indicate, that pricing sensitivity for new business through comparative raters is just significantly different than it was in the past. And we have all sorts of data that shows when you're lowest in the comparative raters space, when you're second lowest and when you're third lowest. And so we know what it takes to be successful. And so I -- we don't believe that there's anything, with respect to our product, that needs to be reengineered or -- I mean, we're always filing changes. We're always filing changes in pricing. We're always filing changes in underwriting and claimants. So there's always changes going on. But we believe this is the issue in the new business front. And you're right, the renewal business has been quite stable, and that is very encouraging. So we think we're on the right path here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have 2 questions here for you. First, Jay, I'm just curious, the acquisition of Dominion, nice, opportunistic acquisition. But given where your stock price now is trading on a price-to-book multiple, does it change at all your thought process with respect to capital allocation? Are acquisitions here potentially more attractive than share buyback?","Jay S. Fishman","No, I don't believe so. This was -- there were a couple of things about the Dominion transaction that were really appealing to us. One, is it gave us some real size and scale in a market where we just were lacking badly; two, there were some scarcity value up there. There are precious few companies to be acquired. They're either mutuals or subsidiaries of larger companies or very large companies themselves. So there is a scarcity value. And it provided a first-rate management team, we think, and a terrific systems and technology and a platform to do business. So it had several compelling reasons that really just had us think about it as a special opportunity but not thinking about it differently in the context of capital management, no.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then the second question, I wonder if you could chat a little bit about the small commercial business. It seems to continue to be a little sluggish there. Is that because of the economic environment? Is it because that there's maybe more competitive down there? Why is it tending to be a little bit slower from a growth standpoint, actually declining this quarter on a written premium basis than some of the other lines?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, Brian, this is Brian MacLean. I'll start. There's several things that going on there. We've talked a while back about what was going on in the larger end, plus we talked a little bit about Auto trends that we were seeing in commercial and specifically in the Select world. So there were some targeted underwriting actions that we were taking, which we have now pretty much worked through. And it was a business, if you think of -- it's almost a great example of the segmentation concept that I was talking about in commercial accounts. If you looked across our spectrum of businesses in Business Insurance a couple of years ago, Select would've been one that, from a return perspective, we were struggling with more than others. So it would've been on the writer side of the graph of our businesses. And if you look at the pricing that we've gotten there, and in that business, RPC is really driving to the bottom line, we've gone to the point where we feel pretty good. We've worked through some underwriting actions, and that's one that we would be hopeful expecting that as the return picture has improved, we're going to be retaining more of that business going forward. So it is -- it's -- we feel good about how we've executed but we think the trajectory there should be changing in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, a couple of things. First, I guess 2 questions on pricing. The first is, the good news on pricing was, on the international side, it looks like there was an inflection point to the positive side. Can you talk about what's happening there?","Alan D. Schnitzer","Yes, Jay, it's Alan Schnitzer. Certainly, it did pick up a little bit. I wouldn't call it an inflection point. And I'd say that the pricing dynamics outside of the United States continue to be very different than what we see in the United States. I think what you're seeing in our results, in particular, come from our efforts recently to increase our use of data and analytics and manage the portfolio and profitability. I wouldn't say there's an overall shift in the market though.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And I guess getting back to Business Insurance. You described the pricing environment over the past several years as quite stable, and clearly, that shows up in the graph. This deceleration that you've seen, modest as it is in the second quarter, investors are very sensitive to this. And I'm wondering -- I think, Brian, you had mentioned July being reasonably good. If you could give us some indication of where July stood relative to June or relative to the 2Q that would be helpful because, again, people are very sensitive to this issue. You stock is up 2.3%. Any color would definitely be helpful.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, and I think -- so I completely get it. I'll, on one hand, admit that we obsess over fractional movements in these things, but I think we and the marketplace are obsessing a little too much. And I know, we've got a better window into the detail than you do. So if you look at -- we ticked down a little bit from last quarter, literarily rounding off of 7.5%, which had ticked up a little bit from the fourth quarter. So the numbers have really been about, in the aggregate, 7.5%. Within Business Insurance, June was the strongest of the 3 months in the quarters. But again, I'm talking about fractions of a point here, of the difference between 7.2% and 7.4% in total rate. And July looks like -- right now, our look of July looks like it might be a little bit better than June. But again, I'm talking about rounding a couple of cents of a point. So I don't mean to overemphasize it. We get the sensitivity. I think we're all watching the market closely. But it's been about where it's been for a while. And then the last point I'd make is we're really actively managing the business. We're trying to make sure we're getting it in the right places and...","Jay S. Fishman","Yes. Brian, I was actually just going to interrupt because I do think that's so important. These conversations, there's almost a backdrop as if somehow pricing is magically obtained from a third-party source from somewhere. What we're getting is what we're trying to get. I ask the question all the time, are we trying to get 12% and we're getting 7%? And the answer is no. We're managing this process very thoughtfully, always with a focus to not having disruption to agents or customers. We're in the business for the long term. We look at returns over time and will continue to march in improving returns. And as long as we're moving that way, we feel pretty good. And by the way, the retention remains as solid as it has and you can see from the more detailed graph how strong that really is.","Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I guess, really, the main point based on this conversation is that the monthly data trend does not suggest any sort of slip-off, any notable slip-off? And what you're saying is the market to you does not feel like it is softening at this point despite this modest deceleration in the 2Q?","Jay S. Fishman","Well, first, it's only July 23, I think, so it's a little -- always a little reluctant to declare anything. We're only 3 quarters of the way through the month. So what we're getting is, to some extent, anecdotal with some data around it. So it's early. It's early. But if you -- on a more anecdotal basis, if you speak to people in the field, you don't get the comment back that there's any substantive change or receptiveness to our strategy. Brian, would you agree with that?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes -- no, I completely agree. And Jay, basically, I think the way you asked the question, yes, we'd agree with that, that what we've seen in our results and what we see and what were out in the marketplace quoting on, the market looks the same to us as it's been for a number of quarters now. We hear the same rhetoric but what we see and what we hear from our people is that it's continuing to move at about the same pace.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Clifford Gallant with Nomura.","Clifford H. Gallant - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","There's been talk in the reinsurance marketplace that some of the new capacity that's come in has perhaps structurally changed the business, maybe made reinsurance permanently cheaper or at least more stable. I'm curious, how do you -- how will that affect your business over time and how you manage things?","Jay S. Benet","Yes, this is Jay Benet. Well, first of all, as we've said in the past, we operate the business as a gross under -- gross lines underwriter. We don't rely on reinsurance to be in a particular marketplace. And when we do have reinsurance, it's generally in the larger risk or certainly in the cat area. As it relates to our view of the market, and I'm sure there are others who have a more intense view with their utilizing the market a lot more than we are, but given our view of the market, it would seem like there's a lot of capacity that's come in on the upper level cat kind of coverages. And that's helped drive prices down. And as I mentioned, the cost that we had this July of renewing our coverages were favorable, so it costs us less. How that's going to translate or if it will translate into the working layer-type benefits to companies that rely on that, we don't have any great insight, but it would seem, to us at least, unlikely that that's going to be where this capacity would want to play. So it's not a big impact on our business for sure and we'll see what happens going forward in the marketplace. But it seems like most of this capacity would be for higher-level cat coverage where the expectation of loss -- of actual losses taking place would be very, very low.","Operator","This does conclude our Q&A session for today.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning we\u2019ve released solid underwriting and investment results with record net and operating earnings per share for the quarter. Operating income was $919 million, generating an operating return on equity of 16.4%. This brings our full year operating income to nearly $3 billion and operating return on equity to 13.3%. That\u2019s in line with the 13.5% average annual operating ROE we\u2019ve delivered over the last ten years.","During the year, we grew adjusted book value per share by 7% after returning more than $3.2 billion of excess capital to our share holders. Overall, our underwriting results for the year were strong as evidenced by our consolidating combined ratio of 92%. Underwriting results in business and international insurance were solid, and once again, we posted impressive underwriting results in bond and specialty insurance.","Despite the disappointing impact of higher than expected personal auto bodily injury losses. Our personal insurance combined ratio for the year was 95.1%, demonstrating the value of having a balanced homeowners and auto personalized business.","In our commercial business, we continue to be successful in the execution of our marketplace strategies. That resulted in continued historically high levels of retention and positive renewal premium change in the quarter, all of which reflects stable environment. In our core middle market business peer renewal rates change improved by 4 points from the third quarter as we continue to execute at a very granular level to achieve our written return objectives. I shall hear from Brain in terms of new business, we continue to be quite active in terms of submission and quote activity, but also fall in terms of underwriting discipline.","Turning to personal insurance, as you've seen, the results by line were mixed. Our homeowners business once again produced excellent results and grew net written premium for the first time since 2011. In our Auto business, we're clearly disappointed by the underwriting results. During the fourth quarter, bodily injury losses were higher than expected and they developed unfavorably for the first three accident quarters of 2016 and the back half of 2015.","Our claim data, the public chatter we hear from others in the marketplace and other third party data, all calls us to continue to believe that our experience is principally environmental as opposed to specific to us or a Quantum Auto product. Whilst trends change in our business, and as I've said before, our objective is to recognize it and react to the data we have as quickly as possible. We're taking actions to improve the personal auto profitability, and Brain will address this in more detail.","Before I pass the mic to Jay Benet, let me conclude with this. 2016 was another strong year adding to our long-term record of delivering superior results. We entered 2017 with a great deal of momentum, and we're well positioned for continued success.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet.","Jay Benet","Thanks, Alan. As Alan mentioned, we were very pleased with our results this quarter; a record net and operating income per diluted share of $3.28 and $3.20 respectively; operating income of $919 million, up 4% from the prior year quarter; and operating ROE at 16.4%. These results were driven by the continued solid underwriting performance as evidenced by our consolidated combined ratio of 90%, which included the favorable impact of prior year reserve developments which I'll discuss shortly, as well as the unfavorable impacts and cat losses of the $137 million pretax related to Hurricane Matthew and the fires and Tennessee, and higher than expected auto BI losses in personal insurance.","The quarter also benefitted from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute and higher after-tax net investment income, which, after increasing sequentially quarter-by-quarter this year, increased 12% this quarter over the prior year quarter, all due to higher non-fixed income returns.","Fixed income NII of $405 million after-tax was down $17 million from the prior year quarter due to the continuing impact of the low interest rate environment. Looking forward, into 2017 and based on the current interest rate environment and the specific securities that are scheduled to mature in 2017, we expect approximately $15 million to $20 million of lower after tax NII on a quarterly basis in 2017 when compared to the corresponding periods of 2016. This is a $5 million per quarter improvement for what we communicated last quarter due to the recent rise in interest rates.","And of course, if interest rates were to continue to rise from the current levels, this expected decrease in fixed income NII would be reduced even further. In contrast of the decrease in fixed income NII, non-fixed income NII of $96 million after-tax was up $71 million from the prior year quarter, driven by significantly higher private equity returns.","We continue to experience net favorable prior year reserve development on a consolidated basis, which totaled $264 million pretax this quarter, down a bit from the $292 million pretax in the prior year quarter. In business and international, net favorable development of $234 million pretax was driven by better than expected loss experienced in workers' comp and general liability. While in bond in special take, net favorable development of $75 million pretty tax resulted from better than expected loss experienced and fidelity and surety and general liability.","Reserve development was unfavorable this quarter, and personal insurance $45 million pretax, driven by higher than expected auto BI injury losses related to the later part of the 2015 accident year. This corresponds with the increase in auto BI loss estimates that we made for the current accident year, which Brian will be discussing. In total, for the full year, we have consolidated net favorable reserve development of $771 million pretax with approximately $665 million coming from our U.S. operations and $106 million coming from international.","As I\u2019ve done in the past, I\u2019m also providing you with some inside into what our combined 2016 Schedule P is expected to show when we file it on May 01. On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines, in the aggregate, would have developed favorably. On a Schedule P product line basis, all of our commercial products will show favorable developments or very modest amounts of unfavorable development.","For personal insurance, homeowners will show a modest amount of unfavorable development, primarily resulting from the higher than expected loss experience, that I discussed in the third quarter webcast related to a small number of liability claims from accident years 2013 and 2014, and private passenger auto liability will show the unfavorable development that I just referred to.","There are two topics I would like to cover relating to reinsurance. First, we\u2019re very pleased this quarter to have settled with one of our reinsurers in the USF&G versus AMRI at Elcase [ph], a reinsurance dispute that\u2019s been pending for many years. As result of the settlement, we recognize a $126 million pretax, or $82 million after-tax gain, in our fourth quarter earnings. I refer you to the Form 10-K that we filed on November 8th for more information related to this settlement.","Second, as shown on page 21 of the webcast, effective January 01, we renewed our corporate cat aggregate XOL treaty that provides coverage for both single cat events and an accumulation of losses from multiple cat events with similar terms as in the prior year and at a slightly lower cost. The treaty continues to provide $1.5 billion of coverage part of $2 billion in excess of $3 billion after $100 million deductible per occurrence. It keeps the same broad peril and geographic coverage and the same positioning of the coverage layer, providing a significant buffer between earnings and capital, the treaty has a single limit with no reinstatement provisions. And please note that the total costs of this treaty and therefore the reduction in costs are quite small in relation to our operating income.","Operating cash flows were very strong this quarter, $1.14 billion, including the proceeds from the settlement of the reinsurance dispute I just mentioned, and after making $200 million discretionary contribution to our now fully funded U.S. qualified pension plan, bringing total operating cash flows for the year to over $4.2 billion. We continue to generate much more capital than is needed to support our businesses, and consistent with our on-going capital management strategy, we returned $942 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter with dividends of $191 million and common share repurchases of $151 million.","For the full year, we returned over $3.2 billion of excess capital to shareholders through dividends of $762 million and common share repurchases of over $2.4 billion. Holding company liquidity ended the year at $1.68 billion, well above our target level. And our debt to total capital ratio, excluding the impact of net unrealized investment gains, ended the year at 22.3%, well within its target range.","Net unrealized investment gains were $1.1 billion pretax, or $0.7 billion after-tax, down from almost $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the due to the recent run-up in interest rates and spreads. As you may recall, we generally as a buy and hold approach with fixed income investing, so any change in unrealized that relates to a change in the general level of interest rates is something we do not pay much attention to. Cash flows from the portfolio are what matter to us.","Book value per share of $83.05 grew 4% from the beginning of the year. And importantly, adjusted book value per share of $80.44, which eliminates the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains, grew by 7% this year. With that, let me give the microphone over to Brain.","Brian MacLean","Thanks, Jay. I\u2019ll start with business and international insurance, where we are pleased with our full year financial and production results. We continue to generate excellent returns, achieving a combined ratio of 94.3%. Retention for our domestic businesses remained at historically high levels. And we successfully achieved positive rate change with renewal premium increases of over 2%.","As Alan mentioned, retention for the industry remains very strong, reflecting a stable marketplace. And in that light, we were quite pleased that we were able to generate nearly $2 billion of new business premiums, up slightly from 2015.","Looking at the quarters financial results, operating income of $722 million was higher than the prior year quarter by $156 million with a very strong combined ratio of 89%. Operating income included the $82 million after-tax gain related to the settlement of a reinsurance dispute that Jay mentioned earlier. This gain was in other income, and accordingly, do not benefit the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development, was 93.1. The underlying loss ratio was 1.4 points lower than the prior year due to lower large losses and non-catastrophe weather related losses, partially offset by a modest amount of margin compression.","Turning to production, given the returns that we are generating in the segment, our focus continues to be on retention. And we are very pleased that retention for our domestic business remained at 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change of two and half points included renewal rate change of seven tenths of point, which was higher than recent quarters, while new business came in at $439 million for the quarter.","Turning to the individual businesses, in select, retention continued its improving trend and came in at a strong 83%. Renewal premium change was nearly 6 points, and we generated new business premiums of $92 million, up 7% versus the prior year. In middle market, retention of 87% remained at a historically high level, while renewal premium change was over 2 points, including 1.4 points of renewal change, or 4 point higher than the third quarter. New business activity, as measured in submissions and quotes, has been up for the year and in the quarter remained consistent with the prior year. However, as 2016 progressed, fewer of these opportunities met our underwriting standards and\/or return objectives, and accordingly, new business premiums of $226 million in the quarter, were down 9% year-over-year.","In other business insurance, renewal premium change was down slightly with a relatively flat rate environment compared to the third quarter of 2016. While retention remained strong at 80% and new business premiums up $121 million. New business volumes for other business insurance were impacted by the same market dynamics, I discussed the middle market.","In international, production results were very strong in the quarter. Retention remained at 82%, while renewal premium change of over 2 points was higher than recent quarters with the biggest single driver of the increase being Lloyds, which due to the transactional nature of that market, is subject to variability. New business volume of $91 million was up 14% year-over-year driven by Lloyds, including the results of our new global construction and renewable energy groups.","So all-in for the segment, it was a very good quarter, capping off the year with strong production and profitability. Before turning to bond and specialty, I want to comment on our outlook for operating margins, which we include in our quarterly filings. Since our 10-K won\u2019t be filed for a few weeks, I would note that we expect underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined ratio during 2017 will be broadly consistent with those in 2016. This is subject to the usual caveats and forward looking statement disclaimers.","I\u2019ll turn to bond and specialty insurance, which continues to perform exceptionally well. Operating income for the quarter of $161 million remained strong and was in line with the prior year\u2019s quarter; as in improved underlying underwriting margin was offset by slightly lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development; the underlying combined ratio of 79.7 for both the quarter and year with the full year result being an all-time best for the segment.","On top line, net written premiums for the quarter were consistent with the prior year for both surety and management liability. In our management liability business, we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best performing accounts while writing new business in return adequate product segments. And so, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased that retention for the quarter was a record 88%, while we added $41 million of new business. Renewal premium change of 2.3 points down about a point from recent quarters, reflecting the mix change impacting average policy duration.","The other components of renewal premium change that drive profitability were essentially unchanged. So bond and specialty results remained terrific and we continue to feel great about the segment\u2019s performance and execution in the market. In terms of outlook as with business insurance, for 2017, we expect both the underlying underwriting margin and underlying combined ratio will be broadly consistent with 2016.","Turing to personal insurance, net return premiums for the segment grew 12% in the quarter with a combined ratio of 98.2 and an underlying combined ratio of 93.2. For the full year, net written premiums grew 10% with a combined ratio of 95.1 and an underlying combined ratio of 90.1. So, overall, strong results for the segment, but results by line were mixed. In auto, as Alan mentioned, we booked further upward revisions in our loss estimates for 2016 and for the second half of 2015. The auto combined ratio for the quarter was 116.7 and include both the full year impact of the bodily injury related adjustments that I just mentioned, and seasonably higher fourth quarter loss levels.","So instead of taking you to a detailed reconciliation of the quarter, it would be more productive to focus on the full year ratios. For the full year combined ratio, we had a 104.0 and the underlying combined ratio was 101.8. These were both higher than we expected and at a level that does not meet our target returns. For full year 2016 underwriting combined ratio included about 2 points from the 10-year effect that we discussed last quarter. As we said then, when you are growing your book of business, the higher levels of new business will temporarily increase the combined ratio and the impact of 10 year in the year was as we expected.","In addition to the impact of 10-year, the full year of 2016 underlying combined ratio was elevated by 3.5 points due to the recognition of the increased bodily injury liability losses. This result represents a gap that we are working to close. You will recall that we reacted to signs of adverse bodily injury loss development with a reserve adjustment in the third quarter. Unfortunately, since then, we saw a further development in excess of even those increased expectations, which drove our actions this quarter.","The deterioration is primarily driven by an increase in the trend towards more severe accidents. Some of the factors that lead us to this observation are a higher percentage of claims involving distracted driving, more accidents involving higher speeds and more accidents on highways and at intersections. This is also consistent with recent industry data. For example, the National Safety Council report of significantly higher traffic cyclicalities in 2015 and 2016, a two year trend that we haven\u2019t seen in decades.","In response to these developments, we are taking action in the marketplace. Our primary response is to file for increased base rate. And in November and December of 2016, rate increases were implemented in 16 states, which cover about 60% of our quote volume. More rate changes at higher aggregate levels are planned for 2017 along with other ongoing actions to refine and optimize our underwriting process. The combined impact of these actions should be to both reduce the rate of growth and improve profitability. While it will take 18 to 24 months for the actions we\u2019re implementing to fully earn into the portfolio, we do expect that the auto combined ratio will improve in 2017.","Turning to homeowners and other, our results for the quarter and the full year remains strong, and reinforce the value of a portfolio underwriter. The underlying combined ratio of 70.4 for the quarter and 75.7 for the year, demonstrate consistent performance relative to 2015. In terms of top line 2016 saw growth in net written premiums of 2%, and we look to continue the momentum in 2017.","So, as I said, mixed results by line in the segment with challenges in auto mitigated by strong results in home, resulting in a segment combined ratio of 95:1 for the full year. We are fully aware that our recent auto results need to improve. Pricing and underwriting actions we\u2019re implementing should put us on track to deliver a more profitable portfolio in the years ahead.","Finally, as it relates to our outlook for personal insurance, we expect underlying underwriting margins during 2017 will be slightly higher than in 2016, and the underlying combined ratio during 2017 will be broadly consistent with 2016. In agency automobile, we expect underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined ratio will improve in 2017 compared to 2016. In agency homeowners and other, we expect that underlying underwriting margins will be slightly lower, and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly higher in 2017 than in 2016, reflecting higher and more normalized levels of loss activity.","With that, let me turn it back to Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. We're now ready to start the Q&A portion. Before we start, if I could just ask you to limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Nannizzi","Brian may be a little bit on auto. If you could just give us some indication of how we should be thinking about the starting points for \u201917, and given the adjustments you made through the year. When should we start to see the rate increases flow through? And should we expect the starting point to be closer to the develop loss ratio picks you have said now for \u201816?","Michael Klein","Michael, this is Michael Klein from Personal Insurance. I\u2019ll take a crack at that. So, I think you will see the rate increases start to flow through in the first quarter. As Brian said, we began making rate filings in the fourth quarter, really in response to what we saw in the third quarter. Rate filings that we\u2019re now making as we looked ahead to the first half of the year reflects the increased loss of content that we saw in the fourth quarter.","Importantly, you don\u2019t see a lot of the fourth quarter rate filing activity in the production statistics, just because of the timing of those rate increases. They went in November and December, largely impacted renewals not until December. And so, it\u2019s really a timing issue in terms of not seeing and show-up in the fourth quarter of this year. But we would expect that you will see the rate momentum start to build in the first quarter of 2017, and continue from there.","In terms of the starting point for 2017, I would say two things; first of all, as Brian mentioned that 3.5 points that you see on the webcast slide. He mentioned that represents a gap that we\u2019re looking to close. And so in other words that 3.5 points is built into our base-line expectations as we start 2017. And then we\u2019re taking trend and forecasting in actual word from that point. So, the starting point does include that 3.5 points of additional losses and the gap that we\u2019re looking to close.","Brian MacLean","Michael, just let one -- this is Brian. I would also just emphasize, obviously, thinking through the written versus earned dynamic with the rate. And as we obviously get it on a written basis, it has to earn-in overtime; hence, my comment of 18 to 24 months to work-through the 3.5 points.","Michael Nannizzi","And then when you think about the -- and most of your policies are 50-50 annual versus six month policies. Is that right, or somewhere in that range?","Michael Klein","It\u2019s a little bit more tilted towards the annual. So, it's about 60-40 annual versus six months.","Michael Nannizzi","And then Brian when you mentioned the margin outlook for \u201917 versus \u201916.does that contemplate that whatever trend you\u2019re seeing is sort of the need-year, and that we\u2019re not going to see more deterioration? Or does that contemplate that you\u2019re going to see that, the loss trend continue to increase, at may be some pace not at same levels we\u2019ve seen, or if you give some context there, thanks.","Brian MacLean","I think, as Michael just said, the 3.5 elevation is built into our expectation. Above that, we're expecting normal 3.5% loss trend, which includes more normal inflation of severity. But we don\u2019t expect another spike. Michael?","Michael Klein","I would say that just to clarify, so Brain mentioned the 3.5 loss trend. That is an elevated loss trend relative to where we've been. So the forecast, importantly, I think, it's important to take away that and includes both the increased base-line and a higher trend estimate going forward than we had in the past. It's modestly higher but it is a bit of an increase at front.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan","First question is just on the deterioration of fourth quarter. What exactly, sort of like if you are looking back in third quarter, what exactly sort of like accelerate in terms of loss cost trend from the third quarter? And just want to get the confidence that over that what you book in the fourth quarter. Do you think that's -- and it probably not be much matured like a deterioration from that levels?","Brian MacLean","Yes. So the first thing I would say, Kai, it's all the normal stuff. Now, we're talking about very recent accident periods for a very long tail-line of business, so just as a perspective. At the end of 2016, we have paid less than 15% of what we believe the ultimate losses will be for auto bodily injuries. So, it's by nature a long tail-line of business, so it takes a while to play-out. We\u2019re looking at all of the activity that we see, both in frequency and severity of loss, cut every which way you can think of, and looking at frequency activity, incurred losses, the paid losses.","And importantly, we're also, as we went into 2016, we're looking at that coming loss of 2013, \u201914 and early \u20182015 where we actually had slightly favorable development in the \u201913 and \u201814 years, and consistent experience in the early part of the \u201915 year. So we're looking at the history that we have coming into the year. As we went into \u201916, we started to see a little bit of movement in the fourth quarter \u201915 and early \u201916, but still within our range of expectations. We got to the third quarter, and those periods, again fourth quarter \u201815, first two quarters of \u201916, started to elevate above the expectations. Hence, we took the activity and the actions that we did last quarter.","And this quarter, as we look at all of those periods. Again, now we\u2019re looking at the end of \u201915, early first three quarters of \u201916, and obviously, now another quarter of data. We saw a continuation in that trend that was accelerating. And we took what we think was the appropriate management\u2019s best estimate, given all of those factors. And we feel good about it but there\u2019re certainly no guarantees that we can see what's going to happen next quarter. I mean, Michael, if you want to?","Michael Klein","Yes, I think, that's exactly right. I think it's a combination of additional development on the periods that we saw before, and an additional quarter\u2019s worth of data that again reflects the fact that that adverse development continues through the end of the year. And we've made our best estimate based on the information Brain just described.","Kai Pan","My full-up on auto side again is that, if you look at this growth 13% year-over-year is actually accelerated from the last few quarters. As you increase price, do you think that one coming down? And do you think that 2 points of these are new business penalty impact will be smaller in 2017?","Michael Klein","Thanks Kai, this is Michael. I would say a couple of things, and let me give you a little bit of the moving part underneath this growth in the fourth quarter. We do expect, as we put rate into the marketplace and put additional rate into the marketplace, that our win rates will decline. So on the business that we quote, do we convert it? We\u2019ve actually seen, in 16 states that Brian mentioned, our win rates have come down as we put that rate into the marketplace. So, think of that as our batting average, our batting average is dropping as we put rate into the marketplace.","The reason this growth is up in the fourth quarter is actually largely driven by the fact that we ended up with more as fast than we expected in the quarter, so quote growth is actually elevated. So we\u2019ve got more played appearances, if you will, but the batting average, the win rate, has actually come down in response to the rate. Again, we think some of that is timing, some of that, as we mentioned in the last quarter, the ultimate impact of the actions we take depend somewhat on the fact that we\u2019re in a competitive environment, and the impact on growth and a little bit on what happens in the marketplace.","So our perception of what happened in the fourth quarter is we took rates so did the market. The rate impacted our batting average, but the rate also drove business into the market, which drove that quote growth. So the PIF growth is really a quote growth story, not a conversation rate story. In terms of your question about expectations, as we looked ahead, our actions are focused on two things; improving profitability and managing growth. And we expect, that\u2019s why I give you a little bit of analog for 2017 rate looking ahead into the first quarter, we would expect rate will rise and growth will drop as we look into first quarter. What ultimately happens will depend on how those actions play out in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Newsome","I wanted to switch the question onto the commercial business a little bit. And I was wondering if you could give just a little bit more color on the pricing environment in the domestic insurance business. And it's a little bit tough to read the tealeaves. But is it better or is it worse? Is there really any change from a competitive perspective in that business?","Brian MacLean","Paul, this is Brian. I will start, I\u2019m sure there will be follow ups to this. But broadly speaking, we feel good about the trends that we see. When you look across the data on the renewal book, we continue to see some, albeit modest, but pretty consistent improvement in what we\u2019re seeing. And we\u2019re encouraged by that. We think that might be somewhat reflection of the market. But fundamentally, I think it\u2019s a reflection of our execution. Our strategy on our portfolio remains incredibly consistent, and that is to look at in on a very granular or account-by-account or class-by-class basis. And simplistically, for the really well performing business, keep it at the best price that we can keep it at and the appropriate price, and then work hard at improving the rest of the portfolio. And when we look at that granular level, we feel really good about the momentum and also feel good about the aggregate statistics. So directionally we feel positive.","Alan Schnitzer","Paul, it's Alan. I would add to that that it's not just a market dynamic, it's in our execution dynamic. It's a very granular, as Brain said, account-by-account class-by-class. And I think in some respects and importantly it's the franchisee value we bring to the marketplace. So we look at an account and we figure out what we need to do to achieve the written objectives that we have. And I would say probably speaking we've been speaking.","Paul Newsome","How closely does the commercial auto business, or has the commercial auto business, track the results of the private passenger auto?","Alan Schnitzer","Paul, I'd say that we see a lot of the same trends in the businesses. There are different businesses. They have different starting points. The coverages aren\u2019t exactly the same; for example, on the personal line side, you've got uninsured and under insured motors, that's not such a factor on the commercial side. So I would say, broadly speaking, the trends are consistent. We see consistency across them. But the results don\u2019t actually come out the same for a whole host of reasons.","Paul Newsome","So we haven\u2019t seen the severity issue even at a level in the\u2026","Alan Schnitzer","No, I wouldn\u2019t think we haven\u2019t seen it. We have seen. It has impacted recent years. We see a lot of the same trends. But on the auto side, it's largely private passenger. On the commercial side, you've got a lot of trucking. So you've got different dynamics there. Also it just manifests itself differently. And on the commercial side, I mean on the personal line side, auto was obviously a bigger contributor to the segment more in terms of volume, so it just manifests itself more prominently. On the BI side, obviously, commercial auto is a smaller piece of whole, so it manifests itself differently. So we do see very consistent trends across books.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.","Larry Greenberg","So, I want to go back to the auto. And I appreciate that you think it's mostly environmental on top of the 10 year issue. But I guess I just want to challenge you a bit on it. And just question, whether you think it's fair to say that maybe you picked up on some of these environmental factors later than some of the others did. And if you agree with that, why do you think that's the case? And I kind of say this in the context of, when you were growing rapidly in auto and before you picked on the BI trends, I know you talked about being keenly focused on what was driving that growth. So I'm just curious on your thoughts on all that.","Brian MacLean","Larry, this is Brain. And I'll start with, there\u2019s a lot in your question. And we do believe it's a fundamentally environmental issue. We would never say it is definitively exclusively an environmental issue. As I think I said last quarter as I'm sure I said last quarter, Quantum 2 is a relatively new product that we\u2019re working now. And accordingly we are very atoned to looking at how it is performing and always looking to improve it. I would not agree with your statement that we are late to seeing the fundamental trend of what's going on in bodily injury severity. And without doing a long history, you can go back 2011, 2012, 2013, we were talking about this a lot, distractive driving and speeds are not brand new things, and we were talking about it then.","We got to \u201913 and talked about a elevated level of bodily injury, and we were hoping that that would remain pretty constant. And we went through about two year period, 2013, 2014 into 2015, where we saw very constant, again elevated levels but constant with our expectations, of what we were getting in bodily injury. In fact, 2014 has developed favorably and we continue to see that. And what we are talking about now is another increase in that trend. And we\u2019re talking about very, very recent accident periods, and looking at the data and responding, I think pretty quickly.","And so I think there is a bunch of things. Further on the comment of, you\u2019re sure it\u2019s not Quantum 2. We\u2019re sure it\u2019s not exclusively Quantum 2, because when we look across our business the same fundamental trends are in the legacy book of business, are in the Quantum 1 book of business, are in the Quantum 2 book of business, are in the business insurance business. It\u2019s in industry data. It\u2019s without the carriers. So it\u2019s not exclusively a Quantum issue. With that said, we are very granularly looking at how that product is performing, state-by-state sell-by-sell and reacting. So, I know that, and that\u2019s this probably sounding way more defensive than I should, but it\u2026","Alan Schnitzer","The one thing I would add to that, Larry its Alan. The profile of the business that we\u2019re attracting, we actually like it. We look at the profile of all the business coming in, and if we didn\u2019t like that profile, we would have the defending answers for you. But fundamentally, we like it. We just like it at a higher base rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please proceed with your question.","Meyer Shields","One, I guess, question on the actual quarter. There was a slowdown in exposure unit growth within the middle market. I was hoping you could talk to that a little bit?","Brian MacLean","There is nothing fundamental in terms of trends changing there. There is always going to be some normal volatility from quarter-to-quarter and things that drive the exposure. But there is really nothing fundamental that we would identify as a trend.","Meyer Shields","So not related to the improving renewal rate changes?","Brian MacLean","No.","Meyer Shields","And then more broadly speaking, when you look at the targeted after tax returns, would a change in tax rate change what you\u2019re targeting?","Alan Schnitzer","It\u2019s an interesting question. And I guess instead of answering that specific question, let me just back-up because my guess is there is a lot of questions on the call in terms of change administration, macro environment, how it\u2019s going to change, a lot of different things. And so maybe I\u2019ll just back-up. We are very return focused in the way we think about this business. It is the lens which we evaluate just about every decision that we make. And so, we calibrate our return expectation to our cost of capital.","And so there are couples of things going on that could impact cost and capital. For example, if the risk free rate goes up, cost of equity goes up. If the tax rate goes down then our after-tax cost of borrowing theoretically goes up. There could be other things in a change in tax policy. But if you just started with those two simple assumptions, you would look at that and say, gee, if the risk free rate goes up and if the tax rate goes down, you would speculate that our overall cost of capital would go up. If our overall cost of capital went up then our return objectives would go up with it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Meredith","Couple of questions here, just first on the personal lines, do you think that the rate actions you are taking on auto insurance will have an impact on homeowners growth here going forward?","Michael Klein","I think that's possible. We've certainly talked about the fact that our auto growth has -- one of the benefits of our auto growth has been growth in home. That said, we\u2019re doing what we can to mitigate that impact. And we've got specific actions we're taken from an agency management and a distribution standpoint and in another areas to try to make sure that any impacts from the rate actions in auto don\u2019t have any impact on our ability to grow home. We\u2019re trying to continue the momentum that we have in the home line into 2017.","Alan Schnitzer","In other words, they definitely co-relate. But we think -- we\u2019re hopeful there are things we can do to offset that and try to lever up the home growth.","Brian Meredith","And then the second question here. On the domestic business insurance, we've seen your rate activity modestly increase the last several quarters. Is that a trend we should continue? And are you getting to a point now where you\u2019re saying all right, can't let the underlying loss ratio deteriorate anymore on an underwriting year basis?","Alan Schnitzer","I know this won't be totally satisfying, but I think we need to go back to the answer we gave, which is we look at the accounts that are up for renewal every quarter and we try to figure out what we need to do to achieve our written objectives. And it's every single one of those transactions, or every portfolio on the flow stuff, really evaluated one at the time that rises up to that number. So, we don\u2019t think with a broad brush. We don\u2019t go out to the market and say get 1.4 points of rate in middle market. We say this is our overall return objective, and go out and execute one account or class at a time to get there. And we will when we get to the 10-K give you an outlook on RPC. So we haven\u2019t showed that yet, it will be in the 10-K when it comes out. But we never forecast on uniquely on peer rates.","Brian Meredith","But you are forecasting for a flat underlying combined ratio for the next year. And then if I remember correctly that was part of it. But yes, there is going to be better non-cap with at least normalization and then deterioration from rate below trend, right?","Alan Schnitzer","So the margin compression that we've had this quarter and the last few quarters has been relatively modest. And this quarter and in past quarters, it's been within other things that cause volatility in the period-over-period comparison. Most notably, this quarter and probably recent quarters weather and large losses. So, when we give you that outlook and yes we did say broadly consistent, we're certainly not measuring to the basis points, but probably consistent within a relatively narrow range. That takes into account lots of things rate, loss trend, mix, claims handling initiatives, other strategic objectives. So it really is an all-in assessment and we try not to focus too narrowly on that narrow rate loss trend. You\u2019ve got exposure in there too, contributing to margin. So, it really is a [technical difficulty] when it comes to our outlook on margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Jay Cohen","One more question, I guess, about the new administration. Obviously, something that\u2019s being talked about relative to taxes is a board or adjustment tax. I\u2019m wondering if you could share your thoughts on how that may affect your purchase of reinsurance from non-U.S. companies.","Alan Schnitzer","Jay, good mornings, it\u2019s Alan let me start. It\u2019s really hard to answer that question without knowing what the board or adjustments going to look like. And we\u2019ve all read it depends on whether it\u2019s characterized as an export or an import and whether the dialogs or defaults to the new bill, and we\u2019ll see where that comes out. I think broadly speaking, as it relates to us in reinsurance, I think, our answer would be, we\u2019re by enlarge a gross line underwriter. We like our underwriting. We like to keep it. And we buy reinsurance in pretty modest amounts. And so, if there were tax adjustments that change the cost of reinsurance, obviously, we could look for alternative providers of reinsurance. We could buy a little bit less, buy a little bit more. But it would come down to evaluating the individual transaction. But I think the broader point for us is reinsurance is just isn\u2019t that big deal for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Kumar","Two quick follow up on personal auto, the first question I have is. If I go back and look at the rates that were put in place for 2016, I guess, average rate filling for in the range of, let's say 3% or so. So, when you talk about the rate filings in November, December and going forward, how should we think about that number compared to the historical 3% average number?","Alan Schnitzer","I would say it\u2019s a pretty broad range. It depends on the state, and even there, it depends on two things; one, our experience in that state; and the rate need, but also recent rate fillings in that state right, because there is a cumulative nature to it. But certainly, it\u2019s getting bigger than what you\u2019d seen earlier in 2016. And we expect more the same during 2017 to try to close that gap of 3.5 points.","Amit Kumar","Okay, so probably more than that. Is that a fair way to look at it?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, definitely.","Amit Kumar","The second question and the final question I have is, you talked about 60% of your book, 16 states. You said more filings for in the pipeline. Is that immediate? Is that like a Jan-Feb thing, or is that more spread out versus the actions taken in the past?","Michael Klein ","Amit, this is Michael. I would just to clarify the comment. So the comment was 60% of our quote volume. So, again think of that as that\u2019s a new business statistics, right. So, the 16 states that we filed-in so far, those represent roughly 60% of our new business quote volumes; not exactly the same as 60% of the book, just a point of clarification. I would say the majority of the rest of the states have rate filings plan for the first quarter. And so broadly speaking, we will have made rate filings in the majority of the states where we have the auto product by the end of the first quarter. We also have additional rate actions planned for later in the year. And that obviously is all subject to regulatory approval and regulatory constraints to the timing and the amount. But I would say the first round ought to be in market by late in the first quarter, and then we've got follow-up actions on the drawing board as we look into the remainder of 2017.","Amit Kumar","I think that's very helpful. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Tunis","My first question, I guess, just for Brain, and it's on the new business penalty. It doesn\u2019t sound like the thinking has really changed on the impact to the new business penalty. I guess, even though the environments revealed it-self to be a bit more of an issue maybe than we thought a couple of quarters ago. Just what gives you confidence, I guess, to continue to compartmentalize the BI severity versus the new business drag, especially when you think about the fact that a pretty good size of the book is new business? And I guess along those lines, if there so is a big 10 year impact, why wouldn\u2019t we assume that a lot of that strain alleviate itself in 2017 with the growth pull-back?","Brian MacLean","Yes, so a couple of things. So I think of the 10 year impact as being discreet from the bodily injury trend. And so the 10 year impact is just the math of the maturing of the book of business. And in fact where it goes in 2017 is a function somewhat of what growth rates do. It will likely increase in 2017 slightly, as the growth that we've seen in the back half of 2016 earns through the business. But I think of the 10 year impact is more of just the arithmetic of. I don\u2019t think of it is a new business penalty as in a BI where you\u2019re pricing differently.","Michael Klein","Yes, I think, and again I think it's, this is Michael. I would say just to reinforce what Brain said. When we talk about the 10 year effect, what we\u2019re really trying to do is just isolate the impact on the loss ratio from the relative age of the business, if you will, right. How tenured it is? What renewal it is at? And as Brain said, it's essentially a mathematical exercise that estimate what that component is or was. And then the rest of it, the environmental turn that we talked about the 3.5 points that's in the full year loss ratio, is absolutely the gap that we\u2019re actively working to close. What we do in the meantime is we monitor the performance of the tenuring and try to isolate that, and make sure that that is developing as we expected. And that analysis has remained relatively consistent, and is why we continue to have that same 2% estimate a quarter later.","Ryan Tunis","And then a couple of quick ones for Jay Benet, first on the workers comps and general liability, just curious the accident years and those reserve releases. And also just getting color on how new money yields have changed, I guess, today versus the end of the third quarter? Thanks.","Jay Benet","As it relates to the accident year question, it's really spread amongst a number of accident years. We, in the past in our disclosures have said, at times, it's related to accident years X and Y. And when we\u2019re preparing disclosures this time, the laundry list of accident years was exceptionally long and we just said why don\u2019t we just say what it relates to. So, there isn\u2019t any particular accident year for either one of them, it's just spread amongst various ones.","As it relates to the new money yields, just looking up some stats as it relate, let\u2019s say -- we generally tend to focus on the ten year treasury. So, if you look at where the 10 year treasury was at the end of September, it was 1.6 and ended December 2.45. And spreads moved in that time frame as well. So I think you could look at the public data as so what to place, but a considerable rise in interest rates from one period to the next. Bill, do you want to add something?","Brian MacLean","I thought I might add a little. Obviously, the question goes to at what point will new money yields exceed maturing yields. And obviously, the actions before this quarter gets us close to that point. But we\u2019re not yet where we need to be. We\u2019ve done a fair amount of work on it in the last few weeks, and using a whole bunch of assumptions, which would take long times really. We think that where taxable is being replaced by taxables, we reached that point sometime in the first half of 2017; for municipals replacing municipals closer to the first half of 2019.","Obviously, a lot is going to be determined by the shape of any tax legislation as a very extreme, if you needed, a revenue neutral bill and the municipal exemption itself were affected, that would be non-trivial. If corporate rates were simple, and individual rates were simply lowered and the relative value of municipal were affected then they\u2019ve already achieved it. That would be less important to us. But in the bottom line is where is, what I think you\u2019re getting at, we\u2019re not quite there yet.","Ryan Tunis","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks guys.","Jay Benet","And this is Jay Benet, again. If I could just add one thing, not relating to your questions but during my remarks one of my collogues tap me on the shoulder, indicating that instead of referring back to November\u2019s filling of Form 8-K, I inadvertently said 10-K. So, we don\u2019t file a 10-K in November. We did file an 8-K about the settlement. So, I just wanted to correct the record. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Elyse Greenspan","One question first on the personal auto book, as you pointed to your margin outlook for 2017. Can you talk about, I guess, the components of the expense ratio and the underlying loss ratio? The expense ratio do tick down in the Q4, so it\u2019s part of helping to get to your margin goal for next year on some kind of improvement in the expense ratio to offset potentially your continued deterioration on the loss side. Can you just take us through the components a little bit?","Alan Schnitzer","Elyse, good morning it\u2019s Alan. I would say that we go about as far as we want to go and getting outlook. And we\u2019re pretty hesitant to start breaking it down to the component pieces. Part of our strategy, at least on the auto side, was obviously reducing expenses. And you\u2019ve seen that come through to some extent already. But going forward, we prefer not to break out the pieces.","Elyse Greenspan","And then one other question, the business insurance reserve releases picked up materially year-over-year, as well as sequentially. I know you reference it spanned numerous accident years and workers comp with GL lines. As we think about potentially an environment where we\u2019ll see higher inflation levels going forward, just wondering if you could provide some commentary surrounding the pics that you\u2019re using on some of your longer tail lines? And what give you confidence for such a high level reserve releases given the uncertainties surrounding forward inflation levels? Thank you.","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, as it relates to reserving, as well as pricing and loss mix, so particularly year. We\u2019re not assuming in any of the work we do this year or in any previous years that whatever the inflation environment that currently exists. And I have to say, it's an inflation environment related to the specific drivers of losses in our product as opposed to the general level of inflation. But we never assume that things are going to stay stagnant. There is an underlying assumption that things will overtime reverts back to the mean. And as you can well imagine, there is a great deal of actuarial judgment, management judgment, as to what that means.","So - and looking at the reserves as they exist today, looking at how the development patterns have manifested themselves in the lost triangles, we come up with what our best estimate is of the future payments that we will be making. And if those best estimates are lower than what the carried reserves are, we\u2019ll make adjustments for it. But it is factoring in a long-term view as to what the levels of inflation might be.","Operator","And that's from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Jay Gelb","I had a question on your asbestos exposure. Earlier this month, the Hartford announced an economically favorable transaction, Berkshire Hathaway, to buy retroactive reinsurance contract. The size of Hartford's exposure is very similar to Travelers\u2019, at $1.8 billion for asbestos environmental. And there's been $300 million annual pretax drag on Travelers\u2019 earnings for the past two years. I'm wondering what your thoughts are now that other companies are taking steps to address these legacy exposures?","Alan Schnitzer","Yes, thanks for asking, Jay. There's nothing fundamentally novel about those transactions. And as you can imagine, we look at them from time-to-time. So far, we haven't seen terms on one of those deals that we found attractive enough to do. And I'm not sure what else to say about it.","Gabriella Nawi","Great.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, October 22, 2013.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may now begin.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you, Tina. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter 2013 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.","Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it for questions.","Before I turn it over to Jay, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.","Also, in our remarks and responses to questions, we may make mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. And now, Jay Fishman.","Jay S. Fishman","Thank you, Gabby. Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","Our financial results this quarter were really strong. We posted quarterly operating income of $883 million, a 15.2% operating return on equity and record quarterly operating income per diluted share of $2.35. Net income was $864 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, producing a 13.9% return on equity.","In the quarter, we returned nearly $1 billion of capital to shareholders, continuing to deliver on our long-term financial goal of producing strong profitability and returning excess capital to shareholders.","While the current quarter certainly benefited from low weather-related losses, most importantly our underlying underwriting profitability continued to improve across our businesses, largely the result of the successful execution of the pricing and underwriting actions we have been pursuing over the last several years.","While we are really pleased with our financial results not just in the current quarter or year-to-date but over now more than 5 years, we continue to expect to be confronted with more volatile weather patterns and historically low interest rates. As it relates to weather, notwithstanding the fact that in this quarter we had very low catastrophe losses, on a year-to-date basis, our pre-tax cat losses now stand at nearly $540 million. To put that in perspective, that number, again a 9-month figure with a fairly benign third quarter, approaches the $600 million of catastrophe losses that we provided at the end of 2009 in connection with our full year 2010 guidance.","It is worth noting that over that period of time, we believe that our catastrophe exposure has not changed meaningfully, but losses have risen as a result of increased frequency and severity of weather events.","An interesting way of observing this phenomena is through the data on Slide 4 of our webcast where we have displayed the number of extreme weather events with economic losses over $1 billion by year over the last 30-plus years. While this data does adjust losses for inflation, it does not take into account exposure growth over time. Nonetheless, it is hard not to take notice of the trend. We, of course, evaluate weather over the long term and continue to believe that more recent weather patterns are different and cause us to anticipate higher levels of frequency and severity of weather-related losses.","As to fixed-income yields, we continue to believe that interest rates will remain at historically low levels, at least until 2016. Although the long end of the yield curve has moved somewhat, it is not yet enough to make a difference in the return profile of our business in any significant way. Total yields remain just off historical lows.","Consequently, in our commercial lines businesses, we will continue to pursue improved profitability and product returns by seeking higher rates on an account by account basis so as to continue to minimize disruption to our agents and customers. So far, this strategy has worked exceptionally well, and we expect that at least for some time across our portfolio, we will be able to continue to achieve written rate gains in excess of estimated loss trend.","In Personal Insurance, we're excited about the launch of our new product, Quantum 2.0, during the fourth quarter of this year. We are hopeful that this lower cost, lower-priced Auto insurance product will allow us to improve volumes at attractive returns. We will know more as we get into 2014.","And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay S. Benet","Thank you, Jay. Let me begin by saying that our third quarter results, operating income of $2.35 per diluted share, a record level, and operating ROE of 15.2%, were very strong, having benefited from solid investment and underwriting performance.","Our combined ratio of 88.9% was also very strong, reflecting earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends in each of our business segments, a relatively low level of both cat and non-cat weather-related losses and $158 million of net favorable prior year reserve development, which was net of an increase to our asbestos reserves. As has been the case in recent periods while the underlying asbestos environment has remained essentially unchanged, payment trends have been moderately higher than what we had expected. For the quarter, excluding the asbestos provision, which, in a 10-year table, would be included in the prior to 2004 accident year row, each accident year developed favorably, and each product line developed favorably or was essentially unchanged.","We continue to generate capital in excess of what is needed to support our businesses, and, consistent with our strategy, we have returned a very significant amount of capital to our shareholders.","Operating cash flows in excess of $1.6 billion were extremely strong this quarter, bringing total operating cash flows to almost $2.9 billion year-to-date. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion after returning almost $1 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $185 million and common share repurchases of $800 million. Year-to-date, we returned almost $2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $552 million and common share repurchases of $1.4 billion, leaving us with only $759 million remaining under previous share repurchase authorizations as of the end of the third quarter. Since we may exhaust this amount before the end of the year, as announced today our Board of Directors authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases.","All of our capital ratios remained at or better than their target levels. Our debt-to-total cap ratio of 21.4% was well within its target range, although up slightly in the quarter due to our successfully issuing $500 million of 30-year, 4.6% senior debt at the end of July. Book value per share increased 2%, and adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, increased 3% during the quarter. While year-to-date, book value per share increased 1%, and adjusted book value per share increased 8%.","The difference between the unadjusted and adjusted year-to-date growth rates in book value per share was driven by the impact that the recent rise in interest rates had on net unrealized investment gains. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $1.6 billion at the end of the third quarter as compared to $3.1 billion at the beginning of the year.","So with that, let me turn the mic over to Brian, who's going to comment further on operating results.","Brian W. MacLean","Thanks, Jay. In Business Insurance, we had a great quarter with operating income of $526 million and a combined ratio of 93%. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year development, improved by about 1 point year-over-year and reflected about 2.5 points of margin expansion due to earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends.","When comparing the combined ratios quarter-over-quarter, any one quarter can be lumpy. This quarter, the comparison was negatively impacted by an unusually low level of non-cat, weather-related losses in the third quarter 1 year ago and, to a lesser extent, a couple of non-run rate adjustments that helped last year's combined ratio. On a year-to-date basis, the underlying combined ratio improved nearly 3 points due primarily to the earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends, and this is a better indicator of how the business is performing.","Looking at the production results for the segment on Page 10, retention and renewal premium change remained strong and in line with recent periods at 80% and 9%, respectively, while new business volume was up slightly versus the prior year. The renewal premium change was driven by pure rate increases of 7.1% and exposure and other of about 2%. Rate increases continued to be broad based and range from 6% to 10% across all lines, led by Commercial Auto and Worker's Compensation. So in the aggregate, the production metrics in the quarter were very stable across the segment, and we continue to be pleased with this result. But as we've emphasized in the past, the detail behind how we got to the aggregate result is what's really important, and we remain very pleased with our granular execution as well.","The segmented rate and retention results remain largely consistent with what we've discussed in prior quarters. For our best-performing business, retention remained very high with written rate gains exceeding loss trend, while we continue to get significant rate increases on our poor-performing accounts.","So overall, a great story in the segment. We saw meaningful underlying underwriting margin expansion due to earned rate gains that continued to significantly exceed the loss trend, which remained consistent at approximately 4%. Going forward, we will continue to execute on our strategy of improving returns by maximizing the rate and retention trade-off at a very granular level.","In Financial, Professional & International Insurance, operating income of $160 million was very strong, though down 11% from last year. The prior year quarter benefited from a particularly low level of large losses, which, along with year-over-year lower net favorable prior year reserve development, drove the decrease. Similarly, the underlying combined ratio of 92.5% deteriorated by 1.1 points due to the higher level of large losses in the third quarter of 2013, largely offset by earned rate that exceeded loss cost trend in both our bond and financial products and international businesses.","Written premiums in this segment were up 6% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by continued favorable rate in Management Liability, strong construction surety results and higher new business in International.","In Personal Insurance, operating income of $262 million was up 27% versus the third quarter of 2012, while the underlying combined ratio for the quarter improved nearly 6 points year-over-year, driven by lower weather-related losses along with nearly 2 points attributable to earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends.","Looking specifically at Auto production, retention of 81% kicked up from recent periods, renewal premium change was over 7%, while new business volumes and net written premiums were down year-over-year.","Turning to Auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio of 97.6% was an improvement of 0.5 point versus the prior year quarter. The underlying loss ratio improved about 1.5 points, primarily reflecting earned rates that exceeded loss cost trend, while the expense ratio was up about 1 point due to some unusual items, including a charge related to the expense action we discussed last quarter. Excluding the impact of these items, the expense ratio would have been about flat quarter-over-quarter.","Auto loss cost trends remain stable at about 5% overall, mix-adjusted frequency continue to be benign, while severity trend remain stable at a slightly elevated level. Specifically, bodily injury severity trend this quarter remained in line with what we've seen over the past few quarters.","I'd like to take a moment to talk about Quantum 2.0, our new Auto product which we began rolling out this week and will be rolling out in approximately 15 states during the fourth quarter. Our goal is to offer a lower cost, highly sophisticated and segmented auto product that successfully competes in the marketplace and generates an appropriate return. Quantum 2.0 helps us to achieve that goal by leveraging 8 years of data and experience from Quantum 1.0 to create a more granular and highly segmented product. It will also benefit from a significantly lower cost structure, thanks to both the expense reduction that we announced last quarter, along with a base commission rate that is approximately 2 points slower than Quantum 1.0.","When fully realized, the combined impact of these savings will be about a 12% reduction in the non-loss cost base for the product. So a significant impact.","We're very excited about this product. We believe that Quantum 2.0 will allow us to improve our competitive position, drive increased business volumes and deliver improved returns.","Turning to Homeowners, pricing was also very strong in the quarter with renewal premium change of 11%, retention stable at 83% and new business volume that was up slightly from the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio for Home was 71.6% in the quarter, an improvement of over 7 points year-over-year. The primary driver of the improvement was lower non-cat, weather-related losses, but we also saw over 1 point of improvement due to earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trend. So a very strong underwriting result for the segmented in the quarter as we continue to see the positive impact of the underwriting and pricing actions we've taken.","With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Tina, we're ready for the question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Tina?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Randy Binner of FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I wanted just to go to Page 10. And given that there's so much kind of focus on the red line there, the renewal rate change, I wanted to understand why the previous historical numbers in that chart can kind of adjust down a little bit each time we see this presentation. What drives kind of a revision to those prior quarter numbers each time you update this illustration?","Jay S. Fishman","Right, Randy, this is Jay Fishman. I'll start, and then I'll have Brian chime in as well. First, to your -- we enter into a month's production period. Policies renew, policies don't renew. But it doesn't end as of the reporting date. There can be transactions, cancellations, endorsements, changes in pricing even that occur after the reporting date. So we're always going back and making not adjustments but truing up the reported numbers to what the most recent data actually is. Now I'd make a point that the rate change, the rate change actually is far less than the exposure change will be in a given period. Exposure has audit adjustments embedded in it and, as a consequence, as those are reflected, they will have more change. The rate change, if you look back, has actually been relatively modest and generally is a result of cancellations, early cancellations midterms or other endorsements. But I'll ask Brian to chime in a little, too.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. And one of the things I'll just emphasize is that at the top of the page, it says, \"Illustrative Business Statistics.\" So this isn't an accounting number that's getting booked into the financials. This is us looking at our written production results. And it's -- but it's exactly what Jay just said. When we close the books at a given period of time, we try to make our best assessment of what the production is going to be, but there's also always movement in the accounts. And the adjustments tend to be fairly consistent, but they move around. I don't know, Bill, any -- yes.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just one quick follow-up. And I appreciate that you think that the market's focus on this is too myopic, but I guess relative to the number of 7.2% that you gave at Barclays versus 7.1% now. Is it more just kind of the chatter of those adjustments that Jay mentioned? Or was there actually kind of a lower rate in that last month for the quarter?","Jay S. Fishman","Well, the Barclays number was a 2-month number. At least it was as of whatever date that conference was. This is obviously the full quarter. What I don't know is, if we had updated those 2-month numbers, whether they would have reflected any change for midterm cancellations or endorsements. So I honestly don't know, and I agree with your assessment that you're looking at it too myopically. I don't know the answer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In the Business Insurance segment, the underlying loss ratio, not the combined ratio, it looks to have incrementally deteriorated year-over-year. I would have thought it would have improved given pricing continued to trend in the high single digits. I know high or non-cat weather losses were cited. So is that the main culprit? Or are loss cost inflation rates creeping higher as well?","Brian W. MacLean","So this is Brian and then I'll let Jay Benet comment. But no, loss cost trends are not creeping. They've remained really flat at right around 4%. Obviously, little pieces move up and down, but the overall loss trend has been very, very consistent. The biggest driver in there is the non-cat weather. Jay, I don't know if you want to go through more of the detail, but that's the biggest change that flows through that.","Jay S. Benet","Yes. No, I would add only a little bit to what Brian said. I mean, if you're looking at quarter-to-quarter comparisons, you're always going to see some variances associated with things like non-cat weather impacting the data, which is why in Brian's comments he really provides the information as to what underlying is -- underlying the underlying loss ratio is taking place with regard to the margin expansion relative to earned pricing versus loss trend.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then lastly, could you update us on the gap between the new money yields and the existing portfolio yield? And I ask because the fixed-income portfolio yield has actually been steady for 3 sequential quarters now.","William H. Heyman","Well, the gap is -- there still is a gap between new money yields and...","Jay S. Fishman","By the way, this is Bill Heyman speaking.","William H. Heyman","Oh, hi. Sorry, yes. And yields on securities which are maturing. It's closing. It depends on which asset class you're looking at, corporates and municipals. But in -- let's take long-term municipals. The raw yield, which is an after-tax yield, of new money is still probably 0.4% lower than what is maturing.","Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, so the fixed-income portfolio stayed steady, though, in recent quarters. Is that just due to some nuances in the portfolio?","William H. Heyman","I think the -- I mean, we analyze the change in the book yield of the portfolio to the basis point every quarter, and the change in the first 9 months of this year was 11 basis points. Now in terms of the raw returns from the portfolio, that doesn't really amount to much.","Jay S. Benet","Yes, and this is Jay Benet. Just -- let me just add a couple of points. If you look in our -- in the Outlook section of the 10-Q, we are projecting about a $25 million-per-quarter drag on earnings associated with the reinvestment of the portfolio -- pieces of the portfolio that are maturing at the lower rates. And I think part of what you're seeing or not seeing is the impact of just rounding to the nearest tenth as opposed to going out further when you look at those yields.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","For the $5 billion share repurchase authorization, if I think about for 2013, the company is essentially running at an annualized retained earnings less shareholder dividend pace of around $2.5 billion annually. So based on that, should we assume that, that buyback could take place of around 2 years?","Jay S. Fishman","Well, we've been saying for the last several years, Jay, now that return of capital is ultimately going to be tied to earnings. And so it really is a question of weather and catastrophe losses and all of the various elements. You pick the earnings -- and by the way, Jay always reminds me that we always need to take into account dollars to make pension contributions if necessary or to pay off maturing obligations that we might want to -- might not want to refinance...","Jay S. Benet","Essentially to support the growth of the business.","Jay S. Fishman","Support the growth of the business. So there's always an additional call. But you figure the earnings, divide that into 5, whatever the number is, it's probably not an unreasonable assumption. Include dividends when you do that, by the way.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then that $5 billion authorization, given the magnitude of that potential buyback, it appears that signals a strong degree of confidence in your overall reserve position?","Jay S. Benet","Our reserve position is always our best estimate of what our reserves should be, and I think you can see how the reserves have been playing out over the last many years.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right, okay. And then any thoughts you'd like to provide on the proposed accounting changes from FASB on GAAP for insurance companies given that they could be substantial in terms of the -- and also somewhat adverse relative to how insurers present their financial positions?","Jay S. Fishman","We'll always do what regulators ask us to do. And however we're asked to report, we'll report. We don't have a view. We follow directions.","Jay S. Benet","Okay, and if I can add a couple of things to that. Certainly, we are always very compliant. This is a draft that's been issued. And like other companies, we are responding to the draft, talking to the FASB about what we think is good about it and suggesting areas to be improved.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just one question in BI. It looks like property grew the most this quarter. It hasn't happened for a while in terms of year-over-year premium growth. Just trying to understand. Given that, that doesn't appear where pricing is best, is that a deliberate area of growth for you? Are you seeing exposure growth? Or is that just -- or is that new business? Just a little context on that would be great.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. So this is Brian. So if you really get underneath what's driving the growth in premium, it's very strong retention and it's pricing. So we're not growing our risk count there anything dramatically. And in fact, our overall pricing in the property line, our results throughout this year have been strong and actually a little bit ahead of what the total BI average is. So retention is very strong, pricing has been solid and we feel good about it, so.","Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess the year-over-year has been a bit of a focus in BI in terms of the margin. You cited non-cat weather there being a contributor. It sounds like it went the other way in Homeowners. But I guess the question is, is the fourth quarter -- what's the setup for the fourth quarter? Just given that the sequential -- the comp averages improved sequentially in fourth quarter versus third quarter last year. Is it going to be tough comps again because of non-cat weather in 4Q?","Brian W. MacLean","Well, let me go back and just clarify the non-cat weather story across the place. So it was, from a meteorological perspective, a light weather quarter. That came through very clearly in Personal lines. In Business Insurance last year, we had an adjustment that we put through in the third quarter to our current year prior quarter property loss pick last year in the third quarter, and it was a light weather quarter in BI. Remembering that Business Insurance is always going to have a little more volatility to the actual losses you could get from an event, you can have large exposures in one year. You have an event, you don't get hit. In the next year, you have one. So that's just to clarify what sounds like a difference in weather patterns between our segments. The bigger story last -- was -- in BI was the last year number was so low. The fourth quarter, I think, we're -- I don't know, Jay. We -- we're not going to get into projecting what we see. Through -- broadly speaking, the thing I would emphasize is the year-to-date, we continue to see something like 2.5, 3 points of margin expansion running through the underlying combined ratio and expect that for the full year, we're going to be somewhere around 2.5 points of margin expansion. So that's, I think, the -- what we're still looking for. And then the results in the quarter will be what they are.","Jay S. Fishman","Particularly, weather.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. that's right.","Operator","And our next version comes from Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to just follow up on the Quantum 2.0 initiative. You mentioned it's being rolled out in the fourth quarter in 15 states. Can you talk about the average price decline? I mean -- or have you filed yet? And can you talk about how that's going to impact pricing in those 15 states?","Gregory C. Toczydlowski","Sure, Greg. This is Greg Toczydlowski. We look at Quantum on a state-by-state rollout basis. Brian referenced some of the expense reductions across the non-loss component of the business at the minus 12. If you think of that across the country, that's somewhere in the minus 10 to minus 13 range from a pricing perspective or the lower price of Quantum 2.0. Of course, that will vary at a very local territory level. But in aggregate, that's a good sense for you to understand what the pricing disparity will be.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes. And specifically, you asked have we filed. We're in the process of doing that. So as we roll out states, obviously -- obviously we've filed in a lot of places. And as we get the approvals, we're rolling out. And our plan is that by the end of June, by the end of the second quarter next year, we will essentially be fully rolled out, which means that there will always be those few states where we have a kind of a unique regulatory environment and work with a different product.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's very clear. So just to come back, so the average price decline for this product versus before is 10% -- so this is 10% cheaper to your clients then than what they were getting before, is it? Nationwide by June, that's what you're going to have on the shelf?","Gregory C. Toczydlowski","That's correct, Greg. And again, that's a generalization. All states have variations, but that's kind of the high-level math.","Jay S. Fishman","And Greg, I'd make just 2 points. First, that is literally across the entire book. So you will find we have prices -- we showed you a graph previously, we have prices in 2.0 that are higher than 1.0, and we have prices in 2.0 that are considerably down more than 10%. I would draw your attention back to last quarter, the webcast where we gave you that...","Gabriella Nawi","The chart.","Jay S. Fishman","That spot diagram...","Gabriella Nawi","Yes.","Jay S. Fishman","That we have out there...","Brian W. MacLean","The Barclays presentation.","Jay S. Fishman","The Barclays presentation. But that's -- so it's important to remember that it's a big divergence. It's not 10% for every account. Plus, we really don't know how quickly the renewal book will move over to -- so this is -- it's new only, but at -- available to agents for renewal business where they opt for it. We just don't know yet how quickly that renewal book will roll over either, so we're in a wait-and-see pattern there as well.","Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood, understood. And what are you doing on the Homeowners side? Will Quantum pick up Homeowners business at all? Does it focus on Homeowners? Or what will you be doing there?","Brian W. MacLean","Well, the Quantum product is purely an Auto product. The majority of our business is account business, though, however. So we believe we will absolutely see a lift in the Homeowners production side as we roll out a more competitive Auto product.","Jay S. Fishman","And I'd make the observation that the decline in policies in force in the Homeowners book is meaningfully tilted towards catastrophe-focused areas where losses have been more challenging in the context of a changing weather environment. It's being driven by higher deductibles, higher pricing, but it's not -- meaning it's not uniquely a pricing issue in Homeowners. It's also a catastrophe management dynamic that sits around it. We were hopeful that it wouldn't have had as much decline as it has had, but it is what it is and we're going to price for catastrophes appropriately and manage our book accordingly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","So just to follow up on the last question on Quantum 2.0. If the pricing changes approximately 10%, how should we think about sort of a commensurate impact on margins?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, so this is Brian again, and [indiscernible]. But we are targeting the same returns on this product that we do in our overall business. So as we look at the expense actions we're taking and the underwriting and risk selection that we're refining on the product side, we -- that'll be partly driven back to the consumer in lower prices and partly driven to ensuring appropriate margins. We're looking at both -- accomplishing both objectives. But the fundamental target returns on the business have not changed.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","And what...","Jay S. Fishman","We may experience -- it's entirely possible that we may experience in the early days of Quantum 2.0 a return that is lower. There is -- I don't like the term because it's often confused. There is a new business penalty. It's not a premium penalty. We don't charge less for the product new than renewal, but there is a loss dynamic that takes some time to sort out in the underwriting profile. So it's very possible in the early days that the returns may not be at the level that we'd like them to be. We fully anticipate that, and we'll manage the book accordingly as we make adjustments. But Brian's point about not -- about having it priced to be the same return over time is exactly right.","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's helpful. The only other question I have is, I guess, going back to Slide 10. Has the source of new business changed? I guess what would be helpful is, is it coming from issues at your competitors? Is it a function of the economy? Or is it new niches?","Gabriella Nawi","Yes.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes.","Gabriella Nawi","Sorry, Amit. Just to clarify it, when you're saying Slide 10, are you asking about the new business dollar amounts? Are you asking about... .","Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research","Yes, the source of the new business on Slide 10. Has it changed over the past few quarters? Or has the mix changed? I guess that's what I'm asking.","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, I would say the short answer to that is no. There hasn't been any fundamental shifts in where we're getting our new business from and lines of business and industries, et cetera, so.","Jay S. Fishman","Over a longer period of time, there has been some shift in lines. But in the context of the last several quarters, no.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith of Evercore.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The first question is on the Quantum 2.0 product. I believe you're rolling it out this quarter. What are the indications right now you are getting from the agents on the new business side from that product?","Jay S. Fishman","We don't -- it's just -- it -- we don't have any yet, really. It's just too early.","Brian W. MacLean","I mean, literally, we just started rolling out this past weekend.","Jay S. Fishman","Yes, in 2 states.","Brian W. MacLean","So we're out, like, 3 days. And so it's a handful of states so far. And like we said, it'll be 15 or so by the end of the quarter. We will, in the next coming weeks, begin to get a better answer to that.","Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. The second question was on the Select Accounts in that -- on Slide 11. The new business dropped off a little bit there. Just curious about the pushback you're getting from your clients because it seems that we might be running into headwinds in terms of the amount of rate increases you can get on that business. So I'm just curious about your strategy in this line.","Brian W. MacLean","And so Select Accounts -- and I think we've mentioned this on previous calls or at least, I think, the last call actually. Select was an area -- first of all, we think of that business as the Express world of the really small accounts and then Plus, Express being a little bit more than half of our portfolio. And that's an area where, going back a couple of years ago, we felt the returns in that business were very challenged. We were fairly aggressive in what we were doing from a pricing perspective. We feel better about the returns in the Express world now, and that is one where we are starting to shift our strategy to wanting to, first and foremost, retain more of that book. And then we'll see where the new business appetite goes. But...","Jay S. Fishman","I'd make just 2 other observations. First, retention in the line has been absolutely consistent. So there's -- notwithstanding renewal rate change, that's been in those -- in that high 6 area. Retention has been absolutely solid. And the difference between $97 million of new business and $89 million in the third quarter of this year versus third quarter of last, those are pretty small numbers. I -- there isn't anything that we've seen that would suggest any fundamental shift any real change going on in Select relative to the pricing environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On personal auto, the nonrenewals compared -- or at least the -- policy counts down 12% from 1 year ago, and you have 9% to 10% rate increases. I would think the margin improvement would be better that you're weeding out the unprofitable drivers, getting great increases on the newer drivers. When do we have to wait for this to come through?","Brian W. MacLean","Josh, this is Brian. The first thing I would say is we've talked a good bit over the last probably 1.5 years to 2 years now about loss trend in personal auto and the -- particularly the bodily injury severity side. And that has been running at an elevated level, the aggregate 5% loss trend we've talked about for the last couple of quarters. So as we've earned in the rate increase, the margin expansion hasn't been quite as dramatic as it has in other businesses. So that would be the first point I'd make. The other, on the overall growth, the retention has remained pretty solid and has actually picked up a little bit the last quarter. And the real strategy here is the new product and having a more competitive product in the marketplace and, as Greg went through, the biggest lever in that is what we've done on the expense side. Historically, our loss ratio performance in this business is top quartile, the expense ratio, and that's all in with commission has been the challenge. And so we think the new product will deal with that pretty effectively.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So when I think about the new product and the legacy drivers on the older iterations. Where should we see expense ratio 1 year from today? Will it be higher or will it be lower than it is right now?","Brian W. MacLean","Well, expense ratio, we're -- we fully expect will be lower. So the expense actions that we took, the $140 million that we're taking out of our operations, is not product specific. That's coming out of the business. About $100 million of that $140 million, I think, was Auto, and some of it is in the personal lines franchise, so it will affect the other products as well.","Jay S. Fishman","I guess I'd look at 2 other things. First, even 1 year from now, the percentage that Quantum 2.0 makes up of our total book is still going to be a relatively small percentage. And so relative to the commission component, there will still be a meaningful portion of Quantum 1.0 that will still be on the books. I don't know if the expense ratio will be lower. I don't know what's going to happen to premiums. I don't know how effective the product is in restoring new business. We know what we've done in terms of expenses. That we've done, and we can be very clear and very certain about that. What happens in the marketplace and what percentage Quantum 2.0 makes of the whole book, that's yet to be determined.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I'm going to ask this maybe in a more specific way that it can be answered, but if you had the Quantum 2.0 rate decreases in effect now, do you have any sense as to what the year-over-year PIF change would have been?","Jay S. Fishman","No. I can tell you what we did in looking at its pricing structure was to do a fair amount of back testing. And we went back with the product, and we went back with the pricing and we went back with the sales to determine at least to be able to have a perspective on competitive profile. Now we feel pretty good about that. The back testing results were encouraging. But that doesn't take into account competitive reaction or what other companies will do or not do. So we don't know. I can tell you that the back testing caused us to be encouraged, but we only control what we control. And so I -- we don't know what the PIF would be if we had rolled it out.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, I completely understand. In the 10-Q, you talk about favorable development, even on very recent years, for general liability because, in part, of the judicial environment. Can you talk a little bit about how you can tell, in the near term, whether that's actual benign emergence as opposed to just timing issue?","Jay S. Benet","Yes, this is Jay Benet. When you look at longer-tail lines, you're looking at what's taking place in the current environment. But when we think about the current environment, that's not a snapshot of the last 3 months. That's a snapshot of a longer period of time. So if you see some favorable development in a long-tail line that's taking place and -- relative to recent years, what we're really talking about is going back a few years, looking at the favorable judicial environment, in this particular case that you're asking about, and then saying, okay, now that we know that from the past, what does that mean rolling forward into the loss picks that we had for the more current period? So it's not a look at, okay, what was the expectation for loss in the 2012 accident year, what are the losses there. It's a more fulsome look over periods that preceded that as to what does that mean for our loss pick for 2012. I hope that answers your question.","Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes, it does.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cliff Gallant of Nomura.","Clifford H. Gallant - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I had another question on Quantum 2.0. You said that you were cutting your commissions, I believe, 2 points. I'm just curious, how does the agent take that? Are they excited about the reduced price? So they get volume? And also, I'm curious, when you think about your total relationship with your agents, how important is that 2-point cut on just that -- on just the Auto product?","Brian W. MacLean","Yes, so obviously, it's a question we've thought about a lot. I'd start with, I think broadly, we. And by we, I mean the industry here. We don't give our agents enough credit and that, first and foremost, they fully appreciate the need to have a competitive product in the marketplace. And they are very aware of what's gone on in the private passenger consumer auto business, and they know they need more competitive alternatives. I'd also emphasize that we really built this product with lots of agent input. And hopefully, we've also been able to demonstrate to the agents that we are really committed to the independent agent channel. And this really gets to your last point of when agents look at us and what we do across the spectrum of our businesses. I think they appreciate that we are at the forefront of underwriters that are working aggressively to make that channel successful. So I think all of those things are very positive. With that said, every agent, all things being equal, would rather have higher commission than lower commission. But we feel really good about the dialogue we've had with them and the engagement, and we will see what the results are as they roll out.","Jay S. Fishman","And I'd make the observation that the comparative rating process, it's obvious to us, and we've shared that data with you, is trumping everything, that competitive price at the point of sale from a well-respected company and a quality brand name matters a lot more than whether commission is 1 point or 2 higher or 1 point or 2 lower. There are lower-paying commission companies that have grown value, grown volumes significantly, and there are higher paying that have not. It's not -- it's a factor, but at least, as we assess the marketplace, it certainly isn't the most meaningful factor.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Charles Sebaski of BMO.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Following up on the Quantum 2.0 and the direct market channel. Given this level of an expense cut, is it too -- is this product going to be available in the direct-to-consumer? And do you expect that to grow that channel?","Jay S. Fishman","Yes, and we sure hope so.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay.","Jay S. Fishman","It's certainly -- we -- one of the things that we -- and we've talked about this in the last couple of calls. We've been doing price testing in a couple of states, trying to determine elasticity of demand in a more granular way. And it became apparent to us that we needed a lower-priced product not only to be more successful in a comparative rating agent-driven world but also in the direct-to-consumer world. This will make a meaningful difference. I don't know what happens from the competitive reaction, but this will make a difference in the attractiveness of the product in the direct channel.","Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. The -- a question on pricing and the competitive marketplace on Management Liability. There seems to be increased focus from some of your competitors. I'm just wondering if you have any color on what you see going on there with pricing and just competition in general.","Alan D. Schnitzer","Sure. It's Alan Schnitzer. There's always competition in these markets. And you really can't look at this as one broad Management Liability market. There are different geographies, there are different products, there are different lines, different segments, and each of them has their own dynamics. So as we've been approaching the market, we price as granularly here, as we do in the other lines that we talk a lot about, seeking to get rate on those lines and those accounts where we need it. And we've been successful doing that, and you see the RPC in the quarter having been the result of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So I wanted to continue with some comment -- questions around Quantum. And one of the -- I think in one of your presentations, you guys provided a scatter plot, a sort of new versus old price. I'm wondering if you could talk to us generically about the sort of the lift charts you've done where you compare loss ratios for -- against the price changes you're taking, much like the, I think, the slides you guys used a bunch of times now with your commercial lines of business as people how think -- people think about personal, a lot of changes. And I'm trying to just get a better sense of whether Quantum 2.0 is a big deal from the pricing segmentation perspective or whether it's really more about sort of the repackaging, the cost cutting and lower commissions into just a new business offering that you can use to drive volume.","Gregory C. Toczydlowski","This is Gregory Toczydlowski again. Anytime we bring a new product out, we constantly learn from the prior one. We take that experience, and we get a little more sophisticated and a little more segmented. So Quantum 2.0 will clearly have additional segmentation in addition to some product features that you talked about. But really, when we look at those scattergrams, that really is our understanding of what loss experience is in the marketplace of our quote business and our in-force business. And then we bring the new product out, where there will be, as Jay said, ups and downs across various customers, but it is because of that new segmentation.","Jay S. Fishman","And at the Barclays conference, we actually gave a couple of examples of specific underwriting changes that were incorporated into 2.0 as a result of what we had learned in 1.0, areas in which we had been too stringent, where we had set an underwriting standard that not only wasn't competitive but even when we sold the product turned out not to make a difference in the loss performance. So there's some of that as well in this. It's not just a lower price cranked into a new product.","Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's helpful. A broader question I'd love to ask is you guys very helpfully gave us guidance on pricing, if I can call it that, sort of your outlook in the Q, which I think I interpret -- can interpret as saying that you're going to continue -- you're going to do what you're going to do. And, I mean, the market will do what it does, but that you're going to continue to raise price for the next -- through the end of the year and well into '14. You guys actually have to plan the business many months ahead, rate revisions, product filings. You're probably doing an annual budgeting process right now. What guidance are you actually giving your staff? And what are you actually planning for in 2014?","Jay S. Fishman","Well, first, I'd disagree that we give guidance. We're giving you our outlook. We're required to give one. We do the best we can. We always say that we're going to attempt to do what we're going to attempt to do. We don't know what anyone else will do and, therefore, I don't know whether it'll succeed in the marketplace. We've said that over and over. And also, in the 10-Q, we really speak to renewal premium change in the aggregate, not just rate, but we talk about renewal premium change. What -- our instructions to the field organization in Business Insurance are no different today than they were 1 month ago or 2 months ago or 3 months ago. It's account by account; it's drive business from the right side of the segmentation to the left, meaning from the poor-performing categories to the best-performing categories; as we move left, focus more on retention and less on rate, although it's great if we can get rate in excess of loss trend even in our best-performing business; and at the right side if, and we've shown you this information before, if retention is comparatively low, that's just fine. You're talking about components of the business that are not building value but taking value. And our instructions to them are no different. We don't give them a target. Our experience has been, over a long period of time, that if you give a field force a target, you will get it, but you will not get it in a way that's designed to actually produce improved profitability. You'll get the rate that you asked for on the poorest accounts. You will lose the accounts that are best performing in the minimum rate thresholds. So we give them analytical data. We give them lots of information. And we are very return driven. They try and improve the returns on the accounts, and then we leave it to the underwriters to execute. And that is the way we run the business.","Gabriella Nawi","And this will be the last question, please. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones here. First, you mentioned in the Q that the G&A expenses in the Business Insurance benefited from reduced assessments. I wonder if you can just quantify that for us?","Jay S. Benet","Hold on a minute.","Brian W. MacLean","It's not a number we have off the top of our heads. You want to go to your next one while we look for that one?","Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sure. Yes. I guess the second one, I'm curious, when you closed the Dominion acquisition, do you plan on implementing the kind of Quantum 2.0-type pricing there as well? And in addition to that, what about -- with respect to kind of commission rates and stuff. Are you going to apply that to the Dominion personal auto book? Because I know they got a pretty big Ontario auto book. And how that's going to be impacted by the 15% rate reduction that Ontario is taking?","Alan D. Schnitzer","It's Alan Schnitzer. We will certainly be applying all of our knowhow in technology and thought process from our U.S. experience into Canada. Whether that exact product, with those specific characteristics, translates or not will be a question for us, but we will certainly have all of our resources and knowhow martialed to bring to bear to that product.","Jay S. Fishman","Yes, the commission, the TL&F variance, that you're looking at is about 12 pretax. So it's relatively modest. But when you look at a quarter-over-quarter comparison, it does come into play.","Gabriella Nawi","Okay, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining us. And as always, Andrew Hersom and myself are available for any additional follow-up questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Ms. Nawi you may begin.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you, Julian. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our third quarter 2014 results.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.","And now, Jay Fishman.","Jay Fishman","Thank you, Gabi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read the results this quarter were just terrific, as demonstrated by our operating returning on equity of 15.2%. In addition to posting very strong financial results, the underlying dynamics in our businesses are showing very solid performance and give us continued optimism about our future financial results.","Starting with Personal Insurance, Quantum 2.0 is proving to be a real success. New auto business is a clean double from last year\u2019s third quarter and loss experience well still early is very much consistent with our original plans. Retention on our entire auto book remains high, on a sequential quarter basis total auto policies enforce increased for the first time since the second quarter of 2011 and we expect to see sequential policy growth again in the fourth quarter.","Lastly and positively, we believe our homeowners business is actually showing some lift from Quantum auto. In our Business Insurance segment its business as usual. We continue to achieve rate gains were needed and we see no fundamental change in the competitive environment that is trends remain generally the same. Retention is actually up in almost all of the business units and we remain optimistic about our ability to continue to successfully execute our granular pricing strategy and achieve improving returns.","In our Bond and Specialty Insurance business, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased we\u2019ve navigated through the financial crisis in the great recession as successfully as we have as evidenced by consistently strong results. This performance demonstrates the underwriting thoughtfulness and skill that are such a part of the fabric of our organization. And we\u2019re particularly proud of our investment department performance in a challenging environment they\u2019ve maintained their investment criteria and done the right things, another example of our discipline.","Well it\u2019s always nice to post a strong quarter; I think it\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019re committed to running this organization successfully over the long-term. This results that we posted this morning were driven by decisions made years ago that have been translated to successful marketplace strategies. Our long-term performance is really the result of [indiscernible] analysis, our commitment to analytics, insightful discipline applied to a risk taking business and to be candid a little bit of good fortune.","Our energy is going to be committed to two things, first more of the same, first rate execution of thoughtful data drive strategies; second notwithstanding the more of the same approach, we are also committed to challenging our own conventional wisdoms to identify opportunities and making the decisions today that are necessary perhaps even critical to making sure that our financial performance remains top tier.","In addition to hearing from Jay and Brian this morning, Alan and Doreen will provide the commentary on the performance of their business segments. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.","Jay Benet","Thanks Jay. We were very pleased with our results this quarter with operating income per diluted share of $2.61 and an operating ROE of 15.2% driven by very strong underwriting and investment results. Underwriting results benefited from a slightly lower level of catastrophe losses this quarter, $83 million pretax is compared to $99 million pretax in the prior year quarter.","In contrast to the lower level of cats, we incurred higher non-cat weather related losses this quarter, as compared to the prior year quarter, which more than offset the benefit of earned pricing increases that exceeded loss cost trends in each of our business segments and drove a slight 0.5 point uptick in our underlying combined ratio.","Underwriting results also benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development of a $113 million pretax down from a $158 million pretax in the prior year quarter. Current quarter net favorable prior year reserve development included a $250 million pretax increase to our [indiscernible] reserves driven mostly by increases in the company\u2019s estimate of projected settlement and defense cost related to a broad number of policyholders due to a higher level of litigation activities surrounding mesothelioma claims than we\u2019ve previously anticipated.","As well as a $77 million pretax increase in our ULAE reserves that the accrual of interest resulting from a recent court decision relating to the asbestos direct action litigation. On the positive side current quarter reserve development included a $64 million pretax benefit resulting from better than expected loss experience related to an old workers compensation reinsurance pool that we participated in along with another pretax benefit of $98 million that resulted from the final commutation of assumed and ceded reinsurance treaties associated with that pool.","Current quarter reserve development also benefited from better than expected loss experience in GL, property and fidelity and surety in recent accident years. And year-to-date on a combined stat basis for all of our subs and excluding A&E, all accident years developed favorably.","Overtime, we\u2019ve generated much more capital than what is needed to support our business. This has allowed us to return over $900 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, we pay dividend of a $186 million and repurchase $751 million of our common shares consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy. And year-to-date, we returned almost $2.9 billion of excess capital to our shareholders, with dividends of $553 million and common share repurchases of $2.3 billion.","Shifting from the current year; let me provide a historical view of how our capital management strategy is performed over time. The Board of Directors initiated the current share repurchase program on May 2nd, 2006 a little over 8 years ago. On May 1st, 2006 the day before the board authorization Travelers market capital was $30.2 billion and we had approximately 696 million shares outstanding. Since that time, we\u2019ve repurchased over 416 million shares at an average price of $56.50 per share issued a net amount of approximately 51 million shares mostly in connection with share-based incentive comp awards, and now have 331 million shares outstanding at the end of the current quarter, a 52% reduction in our common shares.","And if you add in the dividends that we paid during this time period, we\u2019ve returned approximately 98% of our May 1, 2006 market cap to our shareholders. We accomplish this all throughout this period while maintaining capital and support of strategic business opportunities such as those in Brazil and Canada, very strong holding company liquidity and modest debt levels.","Notably our ratings increased during this time period from already very high levels to industry leading levels. And even after returning all of this capital to our shareholders, our market cap stands at $31.6 billion today.","Operating cash flows of over a $1.8 billion we\u2019re extremely strong this quarter bringing total operating cash flows almost $3.2 billion year-to-date. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of almost $1.9 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Our debt-to-total capital ratio of 21.3% was lower than its target range and during the quarter book value per share increased 1% and adjusted book value per share which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses increased 2%, while year-to-date book value per share increased 9% and adjusted book value per share increased 6%.","Finally net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.9 billion at the end of the third quarter as compared to $2 billion at the beginning of the year.","With that, let me turn things over to Brian.","Brian MacLean","Thanks, Jay. Before Alan and Doreen go over the segment results, I would like to give some perspective on how we view the overall market. And to do that, I will start with returns. We are a return-focused company and, as such, we are pleased with our reported ROE for the quarter and year-to-date. We are especially pleased that we were able to deliver these results and what continues to be a very challenging investment environment, one where 10-year Treasury yields continue to hover between 2% and 2.5%. When we look at our returns below this aggregate level, we are also encouraged.","To understand our product profitability, we look at accident year returns at the line level; and at this more detailed level, we are very pleased both with the improvement that we have seen over the last several years and with the absolute level that those returns are at today. There are obviously differences line by line, but overall we continue to see signs of a rational marketplace. Doreen and Alan will go through the segment production statistics, but as we analyze our results at a very granular level, we see that we continue to be successful in executing our pricing strategy, which is to retain a high percentage of our best business, improve profitability where needed, and write new business that meets our target returns.","I don\u2019t have a crystal ball and I am not predicting the future, but based on what we see today there is nothing in the market that would cause our ability to continue to execute on this pricing strategy to be meaningfully changed.","We are also encouraged that as overall returns have become more consistent with our long-term objective, we have begun to see improving top line trends. We have said many times that volume is never our goal, but that we always seek opportunities to add business that meets our target returns. We have seen improved retention across most of the businesses and higher new business volume in many of them, and we believe that these trends are the result of our strategic focus on delivering meaningful and sustainable competitive advantages in the markets we serve. So overall through the first 9 months of 2014, fairly stable market conditions and very strong underwriting results.","And with that, I will turn it over to Alan.","Alan Schnitzer","Thank you, Brian, and good morning.","In Business and International Insurance, third quarter operating income was $552 million. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior-year reserve development, was 94.9 for the quarter, up 1.7 points over the prior year. The 1.7-point change resulted from an increase of 2 points, largely from non-cat weather in both our domestic and international businesses, as well as the impact of the inclusion of The Dominion, partially offset by the favorable impact of about 1 point from earned price exceeding lost trend. We also saw a modest uptick in our expense ratio, mostly attributable to a favorable item in 2013.","Turning to production trends for domestic BI, compared to the second quarter, overall retention was up about 1 point and total renewal premium change was up slightly as the increasing exposure more than offset a lower level of positive rate change. Year-over-year, new business was about flat.","In Select, we were pleased to see an improvement in retention to just over 80%, with total renewal premium change of nearly 9%. We wrote $92 million of new business, representing a 5% increase over the same period last year. In middle market, as a greater percentage of the business has achieved attractive returns, we have increased our focus on keeping the better -performing accounts.","Accordingly, we were pleased to have achieved a 2-point increase in retention to a very strong 85% with positive rate change declining less than 0.5 point, and each case is compared to the most recent quarter.","Lastly, new business of $236 million for the quarter grew by nearly 10% as compared to the same period last year. Overall, we feel very good about the production results; but as you\u2019ve heard from us many times in recent quarters, the aggregate numbers don\u2019t tell the entire story. The detail of where we are getting rate and which accounts we are retaining is key to evaluating the success of our production strategy.","In our middle-market businesses, the data beneath these exhibits shows that on our best-performing business our retention has improved to around 90% and we continue to achieve slightly positive rate increases. On our poorest-performing accounts we are achieving low double-digit rate increases with meaningfully lower retention. These results are consistent with our marketplace strategy.","Looking at production results for our International business, retention remains strong. Renewal premium change was down somewhat from recent quarters due primarily to lower rate and exposures in Lloyd\u2019s; and new business was up from the prior year due to the acquisition of The Dominion.","Before I turn it over to Doreen, I would like to make an observation about margins. Many industry observers seem to focus overly so, in our view on the relationship between written rate change and lost trend. Particularly with rate change for the quarter of 3.3 points, dipping just below our current estimate of loss trend, which is about 4 points in the aggregate, I would like to point out that underwriting margins are impacted by a number of other factors including changes in exposure, underwriting actions, business mix, the impact of new business, weather, and so on.","So particularly with written rate and loss trend in such a narrow band, we\u2019d caution you against drawing conclusions about the outlook for underwriting margins based solely on those measures.","To wrap it up, I am pleased with our strong results for the quarter. And in terms of execution going forward, we intend to pursue more of the same.","And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen.","Doreen Spadorcia","Thank you, Alan. I would like to begin by saying how excited I am to again work with Tom Kunkel and his leadership team in managing our market-leading Bond & Specialty Insurance business. Also, I am really proud of the progress we\u2019ve made in Personal Insurance and look forward to continuing to work with Greg Toczydlowski and his team.","Now for the results. In the Bond & Specialty Insurance segment, operating income of $165 million was 38% higher than the prior-year quarter. The increase was driven by higher levels of favorable prior-year reserve development, along with improved underlying underwriting margin. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was a very strong 81.7%, a 4-point improvement from the prior year, primarily due to exiting our management liability excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty as well as earned pricing in excess of loss cost trend across the segment.","Net written premium for the quarter was $556 million, an increase of 1% compared to the prior year. Across our management liability businesses, retention of 84% was consistent with recent periods in the prior year, while new business of $34 million was down slightly from recent periods. Renewal premium change, which can be somewhat lumpy due to variations in things like limits written, liability attachment points, and policy duration, was 4.6% for the quarter, up somewhat from the second quarter.","In sum, strong profitability through Bond & Specialty\u2019s continued underwriting discipline and market leadership.","Turning to Personal Insurance, operating income of $239 million for the quarter was down 9% compared to the third quarter of 2013, driven by lower favorable prior-year reserve development in Homeowners. The underlying combined ratio was 84% in the quarter, an improvement from 2013 of more than 1 point, primarily due to the benefits of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, our previously announced expense-reduction initiative, and lower Homeowners commissions, partially offset by a higher mix of new business.","As it relates to our expense reduction, to-date we have executed on initiatives responsible for about 90% of the $140 million run-rate savings target. As we have mentioned in the past, about half of these reductions relate to claim management expenses, the impact of which shows up in the loss ratio. We remain on track to achieve the full run-rate savings by the end of this year, in line with our original expectation.","Looking at agency Auto, retention remained strong at 82%, while renewal premium change was about 6%. We also are extremely pleased with the progress we have made on new business production, driven by the impact that Quantum Auto 2.0 is having. New business premium of $166 million is more than double the third quarter of 2013, with 90% of the $166 million coming from Quantum 2.0. This increase in new business drove a year-over-year increase in net written premium of 3%. And, as Jay noted, policies in force increased from the most recent quarter for the first time since the second quarter of 2011.","As for the rollout, Quantum 2.0 is now live in all but a handful of prior Quantum states; and our expectation is that these remaining states will go live over the next quarter or two.","Turning to agency Auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio of 96.1% for the quarter was an improvement of 1.5 points over the prior year, driven primarily by the expense initiatives and earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, partially offset by the impact from higher new business volume. Our current view of overall Auto loss cost trend is about 3%, a slight improvement from what we communicated in recent quarters driven by some moderation in bodily injury severity and looking at the improvements in revenue and profitability, we believe our fundamental changes have made our auto product more competitive.","Looking at agency homeowners and others production was strong in the quarter with renewal premium change of about 6%, while retention remained at 84%. New business volume of $95 million was up about 30% from the prior year quarter, due to some lift from higher volumes in Quantum 2.0 overall home production is in line with our expectation.","From the profitability perspective, the underlying combined ratio of 70.1% was an improvement of 1.5 over the third quarter of 2013, driven by earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trend as well as lower expenses. So overall in personal insurance a great quarter with both strong financial results and production metrics and we remain pleased with the results of the Quantum 2.0 overall so far.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Gabi.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Julian, we\u2019re now ready for the Q&A portion. I would ask participants to please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line is now open; please proceed with your question.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Thank you. I want to touch base on exposure growth in business insurance. It appears to be accelerating in the middle market, commercial business and select is showing more stable growth. Can you talk about the differences that are driving that?","Jay Fishman","Yes, the difference in middle market versus select?","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Yes, in terms of \u2013 the rate of change in exposure growth being stronger in middle market than select?","Jay Fishman","Yes, the exposure in fact really isn\u2019t from sales and payroll, its \u2013 and if you look at, look at the starting and ending point, you\u2019re probably looking at the webcast. If you look at the starting and ending points, it\u2019s actually a pretty straight line from those two end points. The way we calculate the number, the impact of audit premium creates a different quarter to after we report exposures in particularly in the middle market. And so, we would expect that to develop over time into more of a straight line.","Brian MacLean","I think \u2013 this is Brian; the other point on select, lot of that exposure growth is values on the property component of C&P.","Jay Fishman","And that\u2019s been an affirmative effort on our part to try to improve the values.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Okay. So any other underlying difference in terms of exposure growth on the small business versus middle market?","Jay Fishman","No there isn\u2019t really, other than on the small side we\u2019ve really been working on the \u2013 the insurance to values and in middle market it really is a function of how we account for the audit premium in the exposures.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Okay. And then I had a separate question on capital return, so year-to-date if my math is right, share buybacks plus dividends are $2.9 billion, operating income $2.6 billion, so clearly capital return running well ahead of operating income on the order around 110%. Can you give and you had a prior comment also saying that there is a continued level of excess capital being generated. I don\u2019t know if you would care to update us on the capital management strategy in terms of could that that gap between capital return on operating income continue to grow over time similar to what we\u2019ve seen this year?","Jay Benet","Hi Jay, this is Jay Benet. Thanks for asking that question. What you\u2019re really seeing is a timing difference in the generation of the excess capital versus the timeframe in what is purchased, its repurchased. So and we look at, particularly year like 2014, one of the things you have to take into account is, how did the end of 2013 come out and it was a very strong fourth quarter and we did our year end capital calculations, we found that we had some excess capital that we carried into this year.","So, we\u2019re playing a little bit of catch up now, but there is no change in strategy, there is no change in execution. It really goes back to the words that we used to describe, the program which is, we\u2019re generating it over time primarily through income and maintaining the capital we need to support our businesses. So that the ratings are maintained and the posture of the balance sheet doesn\u2019t change. And then to the extent, we have the excess capital that\u2019s getting generating we\u2019re buying that over time. But it\u2019s really, it\u2019s really driven by earnings. And you have to look at it, more broadly than just a nine month period.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Okay, so based on that we should still generally think about buybacks and dividends being roughly equal to annual operating earnings?","Jay Benet","I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s roughly equal, in our 10-Q and 10-K we talk about having enough capital to support the growth in the business, occasionally we make pension contributions to a qualified pension plan, so there are other things that will utilize capital in the place. But, the creation of capital is from the earnings.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you, next question please.","Operator","Our next comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great thanks, just a couple of question, in terms of the auto business. We\u2019re trying to figure out, you talked about 6% rate increases and we\u2019re trying to square that with the rate declines that you\u2019ve taken and talked about taking on the Quantum business that you\u2019ve repriced. Can you help sort of square those two things?","Doreen Spadorcia","Michael, this is Doreen. Are you looking at the webcast with renewal premiums change?","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yes.","Doreen Spadorcia","It would be and also our existing book on the renewal book of business.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. So, for a business that you are Quantum is for new business only, is that so that\u2019s your, okay.","Doreen Spadorcia","Quantum 2.0 is for new business only.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it, okay that makes sense. And then, one question on just on business insurance, kind of looking at the margins there and what is, how much of an impact the year-over-year comparison does Dominion having if at all? And how should we think about, I trying to \u2013 I know you mentioned some non-cat weather but, just trying to parse out sort of rate versus loss trend in underlying margin? Thanks.","Alan Schnitzer","Hi its Alan Schnitzer. On the Dominion as we get \u2013 as we get sort of year end post close we\u2019re going to try to resist the temptation to breakout the impact of that in particular. I will tell you that at least in the current period it\u2019s, leaving out the unusual weather that we\u2019ve had in Canada, the hailstorm in Alberta and floods in Toronto. But leaving that out the Dominion was probably about a half a point on the loss ratio a couple tens on the expense ratio. But, we\u2019d really like to move away from quantifying the impacts of that transaction, just gets harder and harder to do as we enter there.","Gabriella Nawi","Sorry and its Gabi, just to be clear that\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t in the prior quarter, he is not setting a level of Dominion.","Alan Schnitzer","That\u2019s right.","Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it, okay. Okay, thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Great, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning and thanks for taking my call. Just on the margin, just to follow on that, is that you mentioned some non-cat largely like a weather related losses. Is that how much, if you can quantify that in terms of how much that to track on the 50 basis point deterioration year-over-year and also is that a pattern where I have seen in the past few quarters, because I guess your peers reported some sort of non-cat large losses in past few quarters as well?","Jay Fishman","We\u2019ve been observing for a couple of years with that the weather seems to be getting more extreme and so this is \u2013 is, consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing over couple of years in quarter weather was worth something like a point and a half on the delta.","Jay Benet","Its Jay Benet, I would add to that, when you\u2019re asking are there trends involved, we are always going to have quarter-over-quarter differences associated with things like non-cat weather or large losses, what we\u2019re trying to do is point that out to give you some insight into what\u2019s taking place. But, I wouldn\u2019t say that in all cases when we say the weather is higher it means the weather was terrible, I mean it\u2019s just higher than it was last year. So, I wouldn\u2019t call this a really bad weather quarter, but last year\u2019s third quarter was actually a little on the favorable side.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s great. My second question is on the reinsurance side. Just given what\u2019s happening in the marketplace in reinsurance, basic pricing coming down, various alternative solutions, and just wonder what is your overall reinsurance strategy. Are you thinking about setting up some alternative structure, including internal or captive reinsurers?","Jay Fishman","Hi, it\u2019s Jay Fishman. We are certainly looking at everything. There\u2019s obviously a lot of activity in that space. We are not a big utilizer of reinsurance, broadly speaking. When you look at the amount of ceded premium that we put out to the marketplace, it really isn\u2019t enough to jump through a lot of hoops and incur a lot of cost to create something that looks snappy but doesn\u2019t really accomplish much financially.","So that doesn\u2019t mean we are giving up. I am mindful of the fact that it is getting a tremendous amount of attention, so I have actually been spending some of my own time in making sure I can actually understand it and make sense of it. So far, without a lot of effect, to be completely blunt with you; but we will obviously keep looking. I don\u2019t anticipate for us \u2013 not to say that somebody else. I don\u2019t anticipate that the change in reinsurance pricing in any broad measure will have a meaningful impact on us. Again, not because \u2013 for example, our property cat treaty wasn\u2019t less expensive; it was. But it is just not enough on a premium base of our size to make a substantial difference.","I have also been asked whether we would be interested in building a book of business and in effect arbitraging it against the reinsurance opportunity. And I am always mindful that when you take on a risk on the right side of your balance sheet, there is some permanence to it; and the reinsurance profile on the left may or may not be permanent. And you\u2019ve got to be very cautious and careful about not finding yourself in an unreinsured position or in a mismatch, which can happen and has happened. I think back to September 11 and what a bunch of reinsurers did shortly in the days thereafter; and lots of us found ourselves with primary exposure without underlying reinsurance to cover. So there is a lot of moving parts here, and we are sure looking at it pretty hard. But so far I would say nothing that really excites me at least a great deal.","Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you so much for the answers.","Alan Schnitzer","Michael, let me just clarify, just so we pull these two questions together and don\u2019t leave any confusion here. What we said was there was about a 2-point increase in the combined ratio due to both weather and The Dominion. That was 2 points all in; about 1.5 point of that is weather and about 0.5 point of it is Dominion.","Jay Fishman","And again, just speak to direction, please.","Alan Schnitzer","Increase.","Jay Fishman","An increase of 1.5 point due to weather and an increase of 0.5 point due to Dominion.","Alan Schnitzer","That\u2019s right.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Hi. Good morning. The first question is on pricing and loss cost trends. I believe you said not to focus too much on pricing being up at about 3.3% and loss cost trend at about 4%. But just thinking about it at a 50,000-foot level, should we expect a small amount of margin compression next year and also, looking at the loss cost trends, if you could help us understand. I mean peers are looking at loss cost trend in the 2% to 3% range; your 4% number seems a little bit high. Just wondering if there is some amount of conservatism in that.","Jay Fishman","Well, I think perhaps we will split the question between myself and Alan. First, the reason that we are just cautioning against evaluating 3.3% versus 4% is that that arithmetic is pretty easy to do, but doesn\u2019t take into account all of the factors that affect the profitability of our business. We have reminded people frequently that a not insignificant amount of exposure base \u2013 particularly, for example, in our small commercial business, will act as an increase in rate absent a change in loss profile.","As an example, to the extent we collect more premium due to inflation adjustments on property, unless the loss exceeds what would have been the previous total insured value level, that increase in exposure functions exactly the same as rate. And so it is easy to talk about a widening margin and I am going to make up numbers here. It\u2019s easy to talk about it when you\u2019ve got, to make up a number, 7% rate and 4% loss trend. And I suspect it would be easy if we were talking about 1% rate and 3% loss trend.","But in and around the number, it is just not that precise to conclude that within 7\/10 of a point that margins will necessarily contract or not contract. Candidly, I am not \u2013 our 10-Q is going to say in Business Insurance or does; I don\u2019t know if we filed it this morning; we did file it \u2013 says that we anticipate margins to be flat, equivalent, in Business Insurance into 2015. And that is our best judgment at the moment.","It\u2019s what\u2019s funny, people seem to think that there is a stunning amount of difference between talking about plus 0.2 versus minus 0.2, but they understand that there is no big difference between plus 2.2 and plus 1.8. It is the same 4\/10; it just happens to be around a different baseline number. So our caution is simply to let you know that notwithstanding all of our analytical skill and insight into the numbers, this is getting pretty precise to make arithmetic calculations based on these numbers. We just caution against it.","Alan Schnitzer","On the second question on loss trend, hard for us to comment on anybody else\u2019s loss trend. But I would suggest you might want to look at mix.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Just as a follow-up, the Homeowners commission expense ratio was low. I was just curious to why that was. Thanks.","Jay Fishman","Can you repeat the question please?","Doreen Spadorcia","I couldn\u2019t hear it. I\u2019m sorry.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Sorry. On the Homeowners, I believe the commission expense ratio was lower this year versus last year. I was just curious why.","Doreen Spadorcia","We did reduce the Homeowners commission rates. Yes; we implemented those in probably the middle of 2013, maybe a little bit earlier than that.","Brian MacLean","And some of the expense initiatives we had from \u2013 relative to Quantum was also impacting Homeowners.","Doreen Spadorcia","Well the \u2013 yes, exactly. So about 25% of our expense reductions fell to the Homeowners line.","Jay Fishman","But the Homeowners commission expense number fell because of a change in the rate that we pay on Homeowners business. We implemented that, again, in the middle of 2013. That is the driving factor there.","Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore","Okay. Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Yes, just a couple of questions. I guess maybe the first quick one for Doreen. You had mentioned, I think it was the Specialty and professional liability business that you had changed your reinsurance session there, and that helped earnings. Can you talk a little bit more about that?","And then separately, asbestos. Surprised no one has asked you yet about it, but another very sizable charge. Can you talk about really what you are seeing there now? It just feels as if this is an annual sizable charge, and you\u2019re almost going on a pay-as-you-go basis, and we should almost expect this kind of charge going forward. I am wondering if you can give more insight into the asbestos.","Doreen Spadorcia","This is Doreen. I will talk first about the Bond & Specialty Insurance reinsurance treaty, and then I will turn it over to Jay Benet for asbestos. But as I think we reported in the past, the decision was made to exit from our management liability excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty; and that decision was made at the end of 2013. And essentially what you are seeing is that, as we looked at our book of business both from a limit standpoint, the quality of the underwriting, we just felt like the ceded premium didn\u2019t make sense given the performance of the book. And so if you were to look at the underlying combined ratio being up about 4 points, it is about 3 of that underlying improvement. And it is really just looking at what premium you wanted to pay for your loss content. So a great decision was made, and we see it in the results.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Doreen.","Jay Benet","Hi, Jay; it\u2019s Jay. As it relates to asbestos, as you know we follow this very closely every quarter and we supplement the quarterly procedures with, what we refer to is the, very in-depth claim study that gets done annually and we\u2019ve completing it in the third quarter. So what\u2019s going on with the data, first of all every time we, put an asbestos reserve it\u2019s our best asbestos of what the totality of losses will be and as you know there are pages and pages in our 10-K and 10-Q describing all the uncertainties associated with asbestos and what\u2019s taking place, we\u2019re not taking place in the environment.","So in terms of the overall environment, I\u2019d remind everybody that, we\u2019ve had the asbestos exclusion in our policies for decades at this point, the product is in use the way it, its formally used decades ago. And the assumptions that we\u2019ve build in to the reserves are that there will be tailing off claims over time based on the ageing population and all the other dynamics to go along with that. So, we are making these estimates and then, periodically looking to see are the estimates holding up in terms of the data that\u2019s emerging.","And what\u2019s been happening in the last couple of years and we can come up with anecdotes to perhaps why it\u2019s happening, but what keeps happening over time is that our estimates which are the best estimates of the point in time are proving to a little short as new information emerges. And in talking to our claim people who deal at this and, asking the ageing question, why doesn\u2019t this stuff drop off at the rate that we had expected, some of the anecdotal answers tend to be and I underscore anecdotal that well perhaps we have a situation where, years ago given where, general medicine was at that point, people were dying of different things like heart attacks or forms of cancers and with medical advances, perhaps living longer and by living longer and not buying of those particular diseases, mesothelioma might develop and, suddenly now you have an asbestos claim.","So, part of this is, the estimation process, part of this is just, trying to understand the trends that are going on, but I welcome the day when we can all watch a sporting event and not to see a point of certainty, adds you know saying if you ever heard the word mesothelioma call this number. But that\u2019s the environment, but I will say that there isn\u2019t a fundamental change in the environment that it\u2019s not new theories or anything like that its more matter of trying to estimate, what\u2019s actually out there. I hope that was helpful.","Jay Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Yes that was helpful Jay, thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg of Janney Capital. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question.","Larry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I respect that you don\u2019t want to get into too much detail on Dominion, but given the fourth quarter will be the first where we\u2019re on an apples-to-apples basis it would be helpful to just know what Dominion is growing at organically and I think when you did the deal, you expected it to be modestly accretive to 2014 and I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s coming to fruition?","Alan Schnitzer","Larry it Alan, I\u2019m just trying to process the questions here. In terms of, on Dominion I should just take a step back and say that we\u2019re very pleased with the transaction the integration is going very well, they are very pleased with the local team in Canada and the way the two teams are integrating and very pleased with the way that the both teams in Canada and our U.S. businesses are integrating. So, I should really start off and I think this is the important message about the Dominion its going very well, there is no surprises and we\u2019re enthusiastic about the deal today as we were and we signed.","Jay Benet","And let me just add in, because it\u2019s a great time to do it. I\u2019m not insignificant a portion of the rationale here was to export and make available in the Canadian marketplace, product and expertise that we had here in the U.S. that had not been developed up in Canada that is still very much the plan. So we are at the early days here, we\u2019re very much at the early days, I\u2019m sorry but that was helpful.","Jay Fishman","Larry in terms of your specific questions, I think we\u2019d really prefer on a business\u2019s size probably not to go down to that level of detail other than to say it\u2019s on track there is, whenever you do a deal of this size there is always some surprises that are a little bit good and a little bit bad that all of those are within the range of expectations and we\u2019re very, very pleased with the transaction.","Larry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital","Okay, fair enough.","Gabriella Nawi","Okay, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Al Copersino from Columbia Management. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question.","Al Copersino \u2013 Columbia Management","Thanks very much. I was wondering if you all had available or were willing to share for the bond and specialty segment and for the personal segment. We have the renewal premium change in the slide deck, I was curious if you are able to give us the rate changes specifically?","Jay Benet","It operates on \u2013 Brian and I will chat here, but those businesses in particular, it\u2019s really quite difficult to parse the rate change and renewal premium change, because they operate so much together. For example the policy limits right so, if you got an inflation element in the underlying property for example that\u2019s going to well shift premium, but that happens in many cases in effect automatically. So we don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t track rate and renewal premium change at the granular level that we can in other businesses to provide that breakout. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s not an appropriate question, it\u2019s with the business dynamics under it operate differently. And therefore really can\u2019t be parsed with quite as much precision.","Doreen Spadorcia","And this is Doreen. We do look at it to Jay\u2019s point, but we find the combination of them with renewal premium change to be the more meaningful way to look at the business. And we\u2019d never really disclose that level. So we can look at it, but we just don\u2019t want to make sure\u2026","Jay Benet","In most, yes in most cases in our personal lines of business, the fundamental exposure is not changing and it is the total price change that is really reflective. And Doreen you could talk about the Bond.","Brian MacLean","You can get, you get changes, but we just don\u2019t parse at that level.","Jay Benet","Bond?","Doreen Spadorcia","On the Bond side, I would say and we\u2019ve talked a little bit about the in management liability in particular on RPC and rate such as again the Jay\u2019s point of combined concept of what the limits are the attachment point, the term of the policy so we look at them blended together. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t look at them or we just its more meaningful to combine them for us for the business performance.","Al Copersino \u2013 Columbia Management","Okay, well thank you all. I appreciate it.","Gabriella Nawi","Great, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question.","Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW","Okay great, thanks. Good morning. Doreen, as there been any change in the competitive environment for personal lines specifically auto over the course of the year?","Doreen Spadorcia","What we\u2019ve seen and we\u2019ve watched this pretty closely to see particularly with our commission changes and Quantum 2.0, what\u2019s going on out there. And I would say in the independent agency channel, we\u2019ve seen some very targeted but, not broad follows in terms of a little bit of people changing commission, a little bit of targeting specifically on price reductions. What we haven\u2019t seen in that channel is anybody really address broadly the cost structure. And so, no it\u2019s not a major change, we just continue to watch it.","Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW","Okay, that good news. Jay you talked earlier about the other factors that can drive margin improvement aside from the gap between rate increases and lost cost trends. I was wondering are those other issues is that expected trends changes it all?","Jay Fishman","Meyer I don\u2019t, is that \u2013 is that expected trend changing it all, help me, I don\u2019t understand quite the question.","Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW","I\u2019m asking it for the, if the impact of other factors besides the rate loss trend gap and its impact on margin expansion, is that given the improvements you\u2019ve had so far for example in the granularity of pricing and so on should we expect less margin expansion from those other factors going forward that we have for the last couple of years?","Jay Fishman","I got it. The answer is, I sure don\u2019t think so. The reason for the caution is simply because it would be, I think, inappropriate to leap to a conclusion that 4% versus 3.3% will, in effect by definition, result in a narrowing margin. It may; I am not saying it\u2019s not. But there are other factors that go into whether the margin gets bigger or smaller, and you are in the range now of the gap between these two numbers that is, loss trend and rate to be such that these other factors, which always operate, they always operate, could actually produce a different outcome than the simple arithmetic would demonstrate.","And again, the example I used before, with a rate of 7% and loss trend of 4%, this is just a loss treat of only [indiscernible]. It is an easy call. And with loss trend of 4% and rate of 1%, it would also be an easy call. But you are at a range now where it is not an easy call. I am not saying from the outside looking in, by the way; I am saying even from the inside it is not an easy call to absolutely say it is going to expand or it is going to contract. It is on the line, in effect, right now, and we don\u2019t know how to be any more precise than we are being with you. This is as good as we have to offer.","Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW","Okay. I understand. Thank you.","Gabriella Nawi","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners","Good morning. Thank you and congratulations on the quarter. Just recently I was doing an agent tour, and they were talking about a little bit more aggressiveness in the spread between new business and old \u2013 and renewal business on the commercial business. I wanted to see if you perceived any change there in that, either in Travelers or in the marketplace.","Alan Schnitzer","Hey, Paul, it\u2019s Alan. Let me comment on us; and I am not sure we are going to comment more broadly on the market. But it\u2019s always dangerous, I think, to take one conversation with an agent and extrapolate from that. I would say from our data we see that over the last couple of years, seven or eight quarters, there has been a pretty consistent gap between new and renewal. But if you look back over a longer period of time, I would say that gap is reasonably tight at the moment on a longer-term view.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners","Then as a separate question, it has been a long time since we have talked about some of the direct channels and other experimentation that you have been working on over several years. I would like to know if Quantum 2 is sort of where we are at with respect to what we are looking at for the future of Travelers for the next couple years, or if there are some ongoing efforts still to build out other channels.","Doreen Spadorcia","This is Doreen; I will just speak to that. So I will tell you that Quantum 2 is definitely a positive for direct-to-consumer as well as the agency channel. It was a product that we thought would be attractive across channels. So as we look at our metrics around conversion and sales, we believe that Quantum 2 has definitely had a positive in that.","In addition to that, we always look for process improvements. We have also been very focused on looking at digital marketing and how to use our dollars in a very targeted way for direct. We also have plans, and I think we have talked to all of you in the past. This is not just direct, but we will continue to look at where we can enhance the property products as well as looking at how we bring accounts together; and that will be both a benefit for the agency channel as well as direct.","Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners","Great. Thanks for the answers.","Gabriella Nawi","Great. And this is our last question. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good morning, and thank you. Congratulations on a great quarter and thanks for fitting me in. So Jay, pricing has been slowing. It\u2019s come off, what, 3% in the past year; and if you simplistically project forward another year, at last year\u2019s pace pricing probably would be zero or maybe even a slight decline. And so I think big picture, we are all just trying to figure out whether the industry\u2019s pricing decline is going to stop at something like inflation. Does it go to zero, or does it go negative?","I recognize you guys don\u2019t want to talk about other companies. But to keep it focused on Travelers, if I understand all the back and forth around the margin outlook and Alan\u2019s comments, I think you\u2019re basically saying that you will keep pricing more or less in line with inflation over the next year or so. Is that right?","Jay Fishman","Well, I can certainly tell you what our strategy is. I have no problem sharing that. And obviously, the ability to execute in a business environment \u2013 we may succeed; we may not. We haven\u2019t changed anything about the way we are approaching individual accounts. I remind everybody of this all the time. Right now there is an underwriter in Kansas City, right now, who is sitting with an agent having a conversation about one account. And they are not thinking about the overall market; they are not thinking about inflation. They are thinking about the return on that account and how do I improve it.","So you\u2019ve got to start with the premise that this really does start at the bottom and work its way up. As accounts have become \u2013 as increasing number of accounts have now had several years of increases and are now producing profitability, returns, however, you like to look at it, that really fall into the boy, we are glad we have that account category, we ask our people to be thoughtful, to be judicious about the way they approach every individual account. It doesn\u2019t have to be a straight line. It can be a stair step. It can be driven by the local market. It can be driven by the relationship with an agent. It can be driven by the size of the book that we have with the agent. It can be driven by whether there has been claim problems or not on that account. All of those things go into the pricing of an individual account.","Now, what we are trying to get to is a point where over time \u2013 we come back to over time all the time that we manage to offset the impact of loss cost by either rising prices or self-help through efficiency or expense reduction. And I point to the kinds of things that Greg Toczydlowski and the group have done in Personal Insurance. That dollar saved in expense is as good as a dollar raised at the point-of-sale in rate, in fact, arguably even better.","And now I will speak really just personally, because I am not sure I am speaking for the whole place. I am hopeful, maybe even cautiously optimistic, that we will not \u2013 and I said this by the way 10 years ago \u2013 maybe not 10, maybe 8 years ago. I personally believe that the property and casualty business will have a meaningfully lower level of cyclicality. Never said zero, but always said a less, lower amplitude of that cyclicality. There are a host of reasons why I believe that. Analytics and data are just one, but a very important one.","And I think it has proven on the way down before we entered into this cycle. I think it has been proven here on the way up. I am hopeful, maybe even optimistic, that that will turn out to be true on the way down. We don\u2019t see anything in the way in which business is done at the point of sale in the market that would suggest that we are at a precipice, that would suggest that something fundamentally is going to change next month, next quarter, or frankly even next year.","Now, we could be dead wrong about all this; it\u2019s possible we could be dead wrong. But we are focused on over time maintaining our margins. It doesn\u2019t mean that an individual account has to have a price increase every year. It doesn\u2019t mean that in a quarter the rate won\u2019t come under loss trend. I would like to know where the mix of business is that is coming up for renewal. The answer to success for us is in the granular analysis more than the headline numbers.","So that\u2019s honestly how \u2013 we\u2019re never anything but honest \u2013 but that is how we see the marketplace environment. That is how we intend to operate. We will see if it sustainable. Again, I am hopeful and maybe even optimistic. There is a thoughtfulness. We understand \u2013 but we are not unique in this \u2013 we certainly understand the world of risk-taking. I have a lot of respect for a lot of other companies out there because I see how they operate, and they also have a great respect for risk-taking.","And that I think is kind of different than it was perhaps 15 years ago. There is a different level I think of understanding and perception of what it means to commit your shareholders\u2019 capital to a risk or a series of risks and turn out to be dead wrong. And I think there is a healthy regard for that, and that has resulted in a set of industry-wide better analytics, better risk-taking profile that I think, by the way, is good for the customer; I think it is good for the agent; and I think it is good for the markets. Wild cyclicality up or down is actually bad for everybody. And better insight, better data, better analytics is actually better for everybody. You get better analysis, you get better, more thoughtful pricing related to risk. So that is a somewhat fulsome answer, but that is how I feel about it.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","That\u2019s really helpful, Jay. I guess just one other question. Related to the personal lines business, you guys have made big inroads with Quantum 2, sort of stabilizing your volumes there, getting a more competitive product to market. I am wondering what your plans are for Homeowners. It\u2019s been \u2013 a decade ago probably wasn\u2019t a very good business, but it sure seems like a very profitable one now. But it has been shrinking for many years. I am wondering what \u2013 when maybe we see you guys turn the corner there and start to use it as a growth engine. Thank you.","Jay Fishman","I\u2019m going to ask Doreen to answer. But just because I am allowed to be so proud of what the organization has done. So as far back as we see the data having, I will say, integrity, and that is at least 10 years and maybe more on a comparable basis, we have had 1 year in our Homeowners business with a combined ratio over 100 and that was 2011. That was the Joplin storms and the Tuscaloosa storms. So whether it was Ike, Gustav, and Dolly or Rita, Katrina, Wilma, it didn\u2019t matter.","The way that business \u2013 actually I will come back to my previous comment about risk-taking. I am just so proud, candidly, of the way that whole organization has operated and thought about risk-taking. So we love the business, and it has been a terrific performer for us. And actually I personally think in the future as the potentials shift between Auto and Homeowners, I think it could very well do some shifting over the next 10 years. I love where we are; but with that, Doreen, you can take the rest.","Doreen Spadorcia","Oh, thank you. And obviously, following on what Jay said, I will tell you that we spent and it goes back to I think one of the earlier questions, just about looking at weather. You probably recall we looked at pricing, we looked at underwriting, we looked at concentration, and we feel really that we are operating now from a position of really great returns. And we see that when we have a competitive Auto product that also helps drive Home, and we are going to look for those opportunities where we can tune the product, so that in those areas that we think it makes sense to grow, that we will.","So again, we weren\u2019t planning just, we talked about Auto where we thought we were going to be flat to comparing ourselves fourth quarter to last year. We knew Home was going to lag a little bit behind that. So everything we are looking at with production is really according to what our expectations were. But as Jay said, we really were a property underwriter; we like the product; and we\u2019re going to look for the opportunities going forward.","Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Great, Doreen, Jay. Thank you so much.","Gabriella Nawi","This will conclude our call. As always, I am available in Investor Relations for any follow-up questions. Thank you for joining and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."]}}
