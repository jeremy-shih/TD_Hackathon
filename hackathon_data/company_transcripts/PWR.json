Jim?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you, Kip, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Quanta Services' third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I will start the call with an operational overview, before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who'll provide a detailed review of our third quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we will welcome your questions.","The third quarter results that were reported this morning were consistent with the revised and preliminary expectations that were announced on October 16. While our results for the third quarter and first nine months of this year had been below our expectations, we expect improved financial performance in 2016, largely due to record backlog at the end of the third quarter, primarily driven by mainline pipe project additions.","Before I provide additional commentary on 2016, I will start with some color about our third quarter results and fourth quarter expectations. There were several factors that adversely affected our third quarter results, the most impactful of which was the margin pressure in the Electric Power segment. As we discussed last quarter, large transmission projects in the United States and Canada have experienced significant delays. These delays have led to increasingly competitive smaller transmission market because of excess transmission construction resources in the industry.","We believe some competitors are more aggressively pursuing work volume to absorb fixed cost. We underestimated the impact of this dynamic on our ability to secure additional work to efficiently transition resources from larger projects to smaller projects. Because much of the smaller transmission work is book-and-burn, and may not hit backlog, this dynamic had a larger impact and is geographically broader than we anticipated.","Additionally, the mix of transmission work has shifted to a greater percentage of smaller projects. Production on smaller projects is less efficient than large projects due to the lack of resource continuity as people and equipment are frequently immobilized from project to project, resulting in margin pressures.","While we believe that these factors will continue into the fourth quarter, and likely into some portion of next year, we believe the delay in large transmission projects is temporary, as a number of large projects are awaiting permits and other approvals, including some included in current backlog. Therefore, we have maintained a portion of our large transmission workforce and equipment in an underutilized capacity to ensure that we are strategically positioned to deliver on larger, more complex electric transmission projects when they move forward.","This management team and our operating unit leadership have a sense of urgency to return the electric power segment to acceptable margin levels. We have a track record going back to 2008, when segment revenues were less than half of current revenues, of operating this segment above a 10% operating margin, and we believe we can return the segment to a 10% or better operating margin in the future. However, market dynamics are fluid and we will not be shortsighted with our strategic decisions. In the near term, we are focused on managing our business to the current environment, while striking a balance between improving margins and maintaining an appropriate level of resources to respond to opportunities when large transmission programs move to construction in the future.","We will not hinder our ability to serve our customers on the larger, more complex projects as Quanta clearly differentiates itself from the competition in this market. We have visibility on several sizeable electric transmission opportunities, or are in active discussions with several customers regarding these projects.","Our oil and gas segment revenues came in ahead of our internal projections, but our margins were softer than previously forecasted. This was primarily due to higher-than-expected cost. We are seeking change orders to offset some of these costs, which are not reflected in our results. Margins were also impacted by revenue mix, with less mainline margin contribution primarily due to project start delays. On a positive note, oil and gas segment backlog increased to record levels, growing 34% over the third quarter of last year and up 19% sequentially, primarily from mainline pipe project additions.","Now I will provide color on our end markets and some preliminary thoughts on 2016. We currently intend to update our expectations and provide additional details regarding our 2016 outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call in February of next year. While 2015 has been a challenging year for our Electric Power segment, the end-market drivers that underpin our positive multi-year outlook remained firmly in place.","The North America power grid is aging and reliability challenges are increasing. There are regulations in effect that encouraged transmission and distribution spending. The North America power generation mix continues to shift away from coal to more natural gas and renewables, and new technologies are being implemented for a more advanced power grid, all of which require grid expansions and enhancements.","In addition, most of our key customers have significant capital deployment programs focused on upgrading and expanding transmission and distribution infrastructure in the coming years. In fact, according to the Edison Electric Institute, by 2030, the U.S. electric utility industry would need to make a total infrastructure investment of as much as $2 trillion, illustrating that solving the North America power grid's challenges could take decades.","However, this market is also experiencing headwinds. As discussed previously, regulatory delays are a challenge as projects become larger and more complex, with the vast majority of planned projects located in densely populated areas. Also, an unexpected outcome of the implementation of FERC Order 1000 is that it is causing many of our customers to shift their strategies in some areas, resulting in project delays as they adapt to this new environment.","We believe this is a short-term dynamic and expect FERC Order 1000 to drive significant incremental electric transmission investment in the future, as transmission programs are built for improved regional interconnection, and to move power between geographically distant markets. As a result, we believe some FERC Order 1000 transmission projects could be larger in scope and scale than what the industry has experienced over the past several years.","As discussed on prior calls, while these dynamics create near-term timing challenges, we believe Quanta's scope, scale, balance sheet and track record of safely executing large transmission projects positions us well for these significant opportunities as the market adjusts to the current environment.","From a market perspective, we expect continued growth in small and medium transmission and distribution investment in 2016. We believe large transmission project delays are temporary, and that the project awards could occur sometime in 2016, though timing is uncertain. That said, we have a positive multiyear outlook for the large transmission market based on the projects we are aware of today. Over the next three years, we are tracking large transmission projects with an estimated aggregate contract value of up to $12 billion, which does not include the potential of FERC Order 1000-driven projects.","Further, recent reports from the Edison Electric Institute and the C3 group expect growth in transmission spending for the next couple of years, with transmission spending remaining at historical high levels through 2020. I would note that transmission spending data in these reports have regularly been revised upward in the past.","We have a strong base of large transmission projects and strategic alliances with several customers that have large multiyear electric transmission investment programs. For example, the combined aggregate contract value of the Labrador Island Link HVdc transmission project and the Fort McMurray West transmission projects exceeds $1.5 billion.","At quarter-end, the Labrador Island Link HVdc transmission project was approximately 15% complete, and the Ford McMurray West transmission project isn't expected to start construction until 2017 and should finish in 2019.","Our Oil and Gas segment has been building backlog momentum with sizable pipeline project awards this year, such as the Maurepas Pipeline project for SemGroup, package A of the Norlite Pipeline Project for Enbridge, and the recently announced REX Zone Three Capacity Enhancement Program for Rockies Express Pipeline. The aggregate contract value of these three projects exceeds $1 billion, and we expect the majority of the revenues from these projects to be generated in 2016. As we shift resources to execute on mainline pipe projects, we would expect a revenue mix shift to occur, where our mainline revenues increase and our midstream gathering revenues soften as we shift certain critical resources to support mainline projects.","Also, on our second quarter call in August, I mentioned that we were close to booking approximately $1 billion of mainline work. Since that call, we have booked nearly $800 million of additional mainline pipeline projects into third quarter backlog, most of which is scheduled to move to construction at some point in 2016. In addition, we are bidding or negotiating billions of dollars of additional mainline pipe project opportunities, and expect sizable awards in the coming months.","With the regulatory delays we have seen recently with the mainline pipe projects, we are hesitant to speak with certainty regarding exactly when these projects will move to construction. However, if the mainline projects that are already in backlog, plus those that are in final stages of contract negotiations, move into construction as planned, we believe we could see significantly increase in our mainline revenue contribution to the segment in 2016.","With respect to other key services we provide in our Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment, our natural gas distribution and integrity work has been growing nicely this year. We believe end-market drivers and trends provide us with opportunity to grow this part of our operations next year as well. We will continue to experience challenges in areas of our business that are impacted by the current low-priced oil environment, primarily in Australia, the Canadian oil sands, and our offshore Gulf of Mexico operation. That said, any incremental softness in these areas should be more than offset by growth in mainline revenues next year.","In summary, while we have experienced challenges in 2015, we expect improvement in our 2016 financial performance, largely from contributions from mainline pipe construction. We do believe the current dynamics impacting the Electric Power segment are short term, as we are working with several customers on future large transmission opportunities.","Further, we have purchased nearly $1.5 billion of stock year-to-date, which demonstrates our confidence in Quanta's long-term growth prospects. We continue to execute on our strategies that position Quanta for both near- and long-term growth, and are confident in our ability to execute and deliver customer-driven solutions that have made us the industry leader that we are today.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our financial results. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today we announced revenues of $1.94 billion for the third quarter of 2015, compared to $2.15 billion in the prior year's third quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $43.2 million or $0.23 per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $87.9 million or $0.40 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2014.","Net income attributable to common stock for the third quarter of 2014 was negatively impacted by a $32.3 million net-of-tax charge, or $0.15, to provision for long-term contract receivables associated with change orders on the 2012 Electric Power transmission project that were ultimately settled earlier this year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release, was $0.30 for the third quarter of 2015, as compared to $0.58 for the third quarter of 2014.","Net income attributable to common stock for the quarter was $216.4 million or $1.15 per diluted share. This compares to $94.6 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year. Included in net income attributable for common stock and net income from discontinued operations for the third quarter of 2015 was an approximate $171 million net gain, or $0.91 per diluted share, associated with the sale of our fiber optic licensing operations, which was completed on August 4, 2015 and resulted in net after-tax proceeds of approximately $848 million.","The decrease in consolidated revenues in the third quarter of 2015 as compared to the same quarter last year is primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our large electric transmission and mainline pipe project, which were adversely impacted by reduced customer spending and delays in project timing due to regulatory and permitting issues. In addition, consolidated revenues and earnings were negatively impacted by approximately 3% when compared to the third quarter of last year when quantifying the estimated impact of changes in foreign exchange rates between the quarters.","Partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of approximately $85 million in revenues generated by companies acquired since the end of the third quarter of 2014, primarily in our Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment. Our consolidated gross margin was 12.1% in the third quarter of 2015, as compared to 15.7% in the third quarter 2014, primarily as a result of the negative impact of lower revenues from large electric transmission projects and mainline transmission revenues, both of which typically carry higher margin.","Selling, general and administrative expenses, as presented in this quarter's earnings release, were $145.7 million in the third quarter of 2015, reflecting an increase of $1.7 million as compared to prior year's third quarter. This increase was primarily due to $4.9 million in incremental G&A costs associated with acquired companies, and $2.1 million in higher non-cash stock-based compensation associated with (18:28) and company-wide long-term incentive programs, partially offset by $6.3 million in lower salaries and benefits costs associated with current levels of operations.","Selling, general and administrative expenses, as presented in this release, as a percentage of revenues, were 7.5% in the third quarter of 2015, as compared to 6.7% in the third quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the decline in revenues and its negative impact on the absorption of consolidated overhead costs.","To further discuss our segment results, Electric Power revenues were $1.18 billion, reflecting a decrease of $213 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 15.3%. Lower revenues were a result of reduced customer spending and delays in projects due to regulatory and permitting issues associated with large electric transmission projects, and normal fluctuations in project timing as certain larger projects that were ongoing in the three months ended September 30, 2014 were at or near completion in the three months ended September 30, 2015. Foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted revenues in this segment by approximately $40 million, and there was a $12.6 million decrease in emergency restoration services revenues to $20.9 million for the third quarter of 2015.","These negative factors were partially offset by the contribution of approximately $20 million in revenues in companies acquired since the third quarter of last year, as well as increased activity from smaller transmission and distribution projects.","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment decreased to 6.5% in the third quarter of 2015 as compared to 7.5% of last year's third quarter. The decrease in margin was primarily due to lower revenues from higher-margin large electric transmission projects and the resulting greater percentage of revenues from small transmission projects, which typically have a lower-margin profile.","Partially offsetting the decrease was the impact of lower general and administrative expenses associated with reduced compensation cost during the third quarter of 2015 as compared to last year's third quarter. In addition, operating margin in the third quarter of 2014 was negatively impacted by the previously mentioned charge to our provision for long-term contract receivables.","As of September 30, 2015, 12-month backlog for the Electric Power segment increased by 5.3%, and total backlog remained relatively flat when compared to June 30, 2015. The increase in 12-month backlog was largely due to transfers of amounts from beyond-12 to 12-month backlog. These transfers were largely offset by MSA renewals with multiyear estimates. As Jim commented, we continue to see the opportunity for additional awards, although they may not contribute to sequential backlog growth. Also, as compared to June 30, total Electric Power backlog has been negatively impacted by approximately $108 million due to the negative effects of foreign currency.","Oil and Gas segment revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by $6.5 million or 0.9% to $756.3 million in 3Q 2015. This increase was the result of revenue contributions of approximately $65 million from companies acquired since the end of the third quarter of last year, as well as increased revenues from distribution and other services.","Partially offsetting this increase was reduced demand for services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending, normal fluctuations in large project timing, and certain projects that were ongoing in 3Q 2014 were at or near completion in 3Q 2015, and regulatory delays related to certain other large mainline pipe projects that have shifted work from the second half of 2015 into 2016. Also, changes in foreign currency translation rates have reduced revenues contributed by our international operations in this segment by approximately $26 million.","Operating income for the Oil and Gas segment as a percentage of revenues decreased to 7.8% in 3Q 2015 from 10% in 3Q 2014. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in mainline pipe revenues, which typically yield higher margin opportunities. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues was lower demand for services associated with certain operations as a result of lower oil prices and permitting delays, which negatively impacted the segment's ability to cover fixed costs.","Total backlog for the Oil and Gas Infrastructure services segment currently sits at a record level. 12-month backlog increased by $380 million or 22.3% when compared to June 30, 2015, and total backlog increased by $540 million at September 30 when compared to the second quarter, resulting in an overall 18.8% increase in total backlog for this segment. Backlog increases are primarily associated with mainline pipe awards largely expected to move into construction in 2016.","Corporate and unallocated costs increased $7 million in the third quarter of 2015 as compared to 3Q 2014, primarily as a result of $2.1 million in higher non-cash stock-based compensation associated with acquisitions and company-wide long-term incentive programs, $1.7 million in higher acquisition and integration costs, and $1.4 million in higher salaries and benefits due to increased personnel to support strategic initiatives, as well as cost-of-living increases.","For the third quarter of 2015, operating cash flow from continuing operations provided approximately $109 million. Net capital expenditures were approximately $39 million, resulting in approximately $69 million of free cash flow as compared to negative free cash flow of approximately $14 million for the third quarter of 2014. Prior year's free cash flow was negatively impacted by the timing of projects as certain electric power transmission projects were ramping up during the three months ended September 30, 2014, which resulted in an increase in working capital requirements during the period.","Operating cash flows from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, provided approximately $395 million, and net capital expenditures were approximately $151 million, resulting in approximately $243 million of free cash flow, as compared to negative free cash flow of $185 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.","I will note that overall cash flows for the fourth quarter will be negatively impacted by a payment of approximately $147 million associated with taxes payable from the gain on the sale of Sunesys. DSOs remained fairly constant at 85 days at September 30, 2015, compared to 84 days at December 31, 2014, and 83 days at September 30, 2014.","Investing cash flows of continuing operations during the third quarter of 2015 were impacted by aggregate cash consideration paid of approximately $29.4 million, net of cash acquired, related to the closing of four acquisitions during the quarter.","Financing cash flows of continuing operations during the third quarter of 2015 were impacted by the repurchase of shares of our common stock for approximately $1.03 billion. In addition, $150 million was paid under the accelerated stock repurchase agreement, or ASR, which we entered into on August 7, 2015, for the delivery of shares that will ultimately be retired upon final settlement of the ASR. These outflows were partially offset by net borrowings of $142.3 million under our credit facility.","We continue to receive questions on the mechanics around the ASR, so I think it makes sense to provide some additional color given the recent move in our stock price. It is important to note that the timing of delivery and retirement of shares by Quanta under the ASR for GAAP purposes is independent of any activity in the market by JPMorgan. All activity by JPMorgan pursuant to the ASR, including timing, volume and price, has no impact on our share count or future cash flows.","The $750 million ASR commitment, divided by the average volume-weighted average price, plus an agreed discount, over the full term of the ASR, ultimately determines the amount of shares that we will retire. Upon maturity, there will be a settling of the account for the total shares due. For instance, if you assumed that our stock price would trade on average at around $23.34, mark \u2013 that mark during the life of the ASR, which was the closing price of Quanta's stock price the day prior to the execution of the ASR, we would repurchase approximately 32.1 million shares. Upon execution of the ASR, we received an initial delivery of 80% of this estimate, or 25.7 million shares. Therefore, upon final settlement, JPMorgan would owe us approximately 6.4 million shares.","However, as a result of the decline in stock price since the inception of the ASR, it is possible that the average volume-weighted average price across the term of the ASR will be lower, therefore causing more shares to be delivered upon final settlement.","The ASR arrangement permitted concurrent share purchases by Quanta subject to declining monthly caps. In order to take advantage of our limited ability to purchase shares in the open market, irrespective of potential unforeseen blackout periods, the company made the decision to put a 10b5-1 plan in place a few days after our Q2 earnings release. At the point in time this was put into place, we did consider the impact of an increasing or a decreasing stock price over the near term. The longer maturity of the ASR provided a cost-averaging approach that would extend well into the first quarter of 2016, which in our view at the time was a reasonable approach to our share repurchase strategy in light of our continued favorable multi-year outlook.","To recap our share repurchase activity through the quarter, as previously announced, we acquired approximately 1.8 million shares of our common stock in the open market for a total cost of approximately $52 million, which completed the $500 million stock repurchase program authorized at the end of 2013.","Under our previously announced $1.25 billion share repurchase authorization, we took delivery of and retired into treasury stock, in accordance with GAAP, 25.7 million shares with a fair market value of approximately $600 million pursuant to the ASR. We also repurchased 15.6 million shares for about $373.1 million in additional open-market transactions during the third quarter. These transactions bring the company's repurchase activity during the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, to a total of 55.7 million shares for value of approximately $1.38 billion.","Lastly, subsequent to September 30, 2015, and through the date of today's release, we have repurchased another 3.6 million shares for $76.8 million in additional open-market transactions. As a result of the above, our common stock equivalents outstanding at September 30 are approximately 166.4 million shares. Giving effect to shares repurchased subsequent to the third quarter, our weighted-average share count for the fourth quarter is expected to be 163.6 million shares, and our outstanding shares as of year-end are expected to be 163.8 million. Our share count in 2016 will decrease further by the final share settlement under the ASR as I have described previously.","At September 30, 2015, we have approximately $49.2 million in cash. At the end of the quarter, we had about $318.5 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments, and we have $339.2 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $716.5 million in total liquidity as of September 30, 2015.","Concerning our outlook for the remainder of 2015, we expect revenues for the fourth quarter of 2015 to range between $1.75 billion and $1.85 billion, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be $0.20 to $0.26 on a GAAP basis. These estimates include the benefit of an expected $2.2 million release of income tax contingency reserves, as well as share repurchase activity through October 30. This guidance compares to revenues of $2.03 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.27 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Included within the prior year's fourth quarter is the impact of a $30.3 million net-of-tax or $0.14 cents per diluted share charge, to provision for a long-term contract receivable, as well as $3.2 million of income or $0.1 per diluted share from the release of income tax contingencies.","Our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2015 is expected to be $0.26 to $0.32, in comparison to our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.48 in the fourth quarter of 2014.","On an annual basis, we expect revenues to range between $7.45 billion and $7.55 billion, and we may currently anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $0.79 to $0.85, and anticipate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.07 to $1.13.","Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release. We are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter to be between 36% and 36.5%, which reflects an estimated tax contingency release of approximately $2.2 million. Also, both quarter-to-quarter and annual 2015 guidance reflect the current foreign exchange rate environment. Continued movement of foreign exchange rates in the future could make comparisons to prior periods difficult, and actuals differ from guidance.","CapEx for all of 2015 should be approximately $210 million to $220 million when factoring in 2015 to-date acquisitions. This compares to CapEx for all of 2014 of $247.2 million.","On a final note, throughout 2015 we have evaluated whether providing quarterly guidance is of value, given the short-term volatility that can occur as a result of project delays and other factors that impact earnings from period to period. As we look to 2016, we will continue to consider whether quarterly guidance remains appropriate, as well as whether other methods would improve communications with investors.","This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Dan Mannes with Avondale Partners.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning, Dan.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Dan.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Hey. First, thanks for the color on the ASR. I think that clears things up pretty nicely. But I did want to focus on the electric business, obviously. You've been in more competitive environments. You've dealt with small project work before and have a lot of experience. I guess my question is, given the current environment, how much of the recent results relate to, maybe, the transitory effect of dealing with the transition versus what the correct run-rate margin should be if this were the environment you knew you were going to be participating in? So basically, can you just help us out with where you could get to if, if the current environment persists, what do you think you could manage margins to, relative to the fixed math you've been putting up recently?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, I think, Dan, that's a very good question and there's a couple of factors there. One, I want to reiterate that there's no reason why we couldn't operate with the current level of business at a 10% operating margin. But you bring up a good point, I mean, we've got transition going \u2013 one of the major things that's occurring is we had a significant amount of transmission resources in the industry working on large projects. They've flooded the market. I think it took everybody in the industry by surprise, is the impact that it had on the smaller transmission market.","So, right now, we do have an oversupply of labor. The market's become more competitive. We can deal with that. We need to keep a level of large transmission resources to capitalize on projects we see on the horizon. But if that didn't happen, hypothetically, we could certainly adjust our cost structure to get back into the 10% range. So we're in a very fluid market right now, and we're evaluating it almost every day. But I do think that we're at some point of stabilizing the business, and now we'll just adjust going forward as the market begins to develop, especially in the large transmission arena.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Got it. And then, transitioning over to the Oil and Gas business, your commentary has been fairly consistent with what we've heard in the market and your peers as it relates to large work coming in. Can you talk to us, and I know this is a challenging topic, about the capacity you guys can bring to bear for next year? Where you guys are in terms of utilization, if booked and expected projects lay out? And how much more you could even conceivably do next year on the mainline front?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, I think utilization is based off on how the projects lay out, right? So we don't have a real clear picture of that right now, because it's early. I mean, you get a $400 million mainline project that could last four months, versus a $400 million electric transmission project which could last a year and a half. So, it depends upon how the projects lay out. I will tell you that we believe that we've got plenty of utilization to take care of the work that we have been backlogged, that we plan to go to 2016, off of \u2013 excuse me \u2013 plenty of resource capacity to handle the work we have in backlog in 2016 and the work that we're continuing to negotiate for 2016.","So, it's very similar to electric transmission when it ramped up in 2011. I mean, we were on three jobs and we ended up doing about five times that much in a period of two years. So, we'll be able to \u2013 we're prepared and ready to take on as much work as we can at our margin profile.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Sounds good. Thank you very much.","Operator","And as a reminder, in the interest of time today, we do ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll take our next question from Andy Wittmann at Robert W. Baird & Company.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. So, I guess in the script, you guys commented that you felt like the pipeline business \u2013 a couple of things need to break your way, that it would be up in 2016? I don't know if I caught a similar comment on T&D with some of the puts-and-takes that are going on there now. Jim, I guess, what's the net outlook as you're heading into 2016 on the T&D side?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Andy, I think that's a good question. I mean, I would tell you that right now distribution in the smaller transmission market has a growth feel to it. There's thousands of projects there in any given quarter, and it's been pretty predictable over the last four years, and I don't expect that that dynamic's going to change.","The large transmission market is what, obviously, is a wild card. We don't have a real good feel as to when those projects will get through the permitting process and move to construction. So, do we think some projects are going to move into construction to 2016? We do. But it's hard to pinpoint. So it's hard to tell what the segment's is going to do overall. I do think that both segments, as I said in my script, have the opportunity for growth next year, and I do think 2015 is a transition year for the Electric Power segment.","But I can't really give any color as to big transmission right now; it's early. And certainly with what's happened over the last several quarters, I'm going to \u2013 time is my friend and I want to wait until February before I provide some real, specific color on the large transmission market dynamic.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Appreciate those perspectives. And then, Derrick, I guess a question a lot of investors are looking at right now is what kinds of things can you do from a process perspective, as you look at results coming in during the quarter, to avoid some of the surprises that we've seen in the last couple \u2013 are there systems, processes, communication and things that need to be happening inside the company to head off some of the surprises that we've seen in the last couple of quarters?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I mean when you think about the first half of the year, a substantial portion in the first half of the year was a weather dynamic. And we're not necessarily weather forecasters, and those things will \u2013 any major weather event will impact us throughout, despite our best efforts to forecast.","In addition, a couple of those things that happened in the first half of the year were very, very one-off projects, specific-type items. If you recall, we talked about the cumulative effect of a couple of those jobs was about $50 million. Although very sizable, it was isolated to the one or two individual jobs rather than being something having to do with the overall forecasting process.","As it relates to the third quarter, we started to see some degree of softness in much of the things that Jim has talked about. But what we, in our minds, we needed to look to see exactly how those things played out and make a determination as to what was there from the standpoint of contingencies on remaining projects and how those would execute through, et cetera, relative to being able to establish what we really felt like what was occurring here in the third quarter.","So, I think that the third quarter is unique versus what the dynamics were in the first and the second quarter. But again, to your point, we will always be mindful of what information we gather in here and how that we can digest it in a way to ensure that our forecasts in the future continue to better align with our real expectations.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tahira Afzal at KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, folks, and Jim, nice to see at least some stability returning.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you, Tahira.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, I guess the first question is, Andrew asked about the revenues and where those could swing on the electric T&D side. So, let me get on the other side and ask, would you at least see backlog growth very constant about that for electric T&D in total?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","My views on backlog are unchanged from past years, past quarters and years. I mean, I think backlog will continue to be strong. I'm not going to say we're going to have record levels every quarter that we've seen this quarter. But it's going to be strong, and that's an indication of the multiyear outlook we have in the business. So, look, I'm very confident about 2016. I think 2016 is going to be a very good year. 2015 was an anomaly. It happened. We're not happy with it, but we've got some really good things going in 2016 and in both the Electric Power and on the Oil and Gas segments.","So I think 2016 backlog should be strong. Going into 2016, I think these big transmission projects will break through and we'll get back to some level of normalcy in what we've seen over the last few years. We're just in a pause right now, but I'm very confident about 2016 and, frankly, the next several years over a multi-year basis. I think we've just had an adjustment in the market and we're ready to move forward again. And 2016 is going to be definitely a better year than 2015, in my opinion.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay, Jim. That's helpful. And then, second question is more thematic. Over the past several months, we've seen several utilities buying gas distribution companies. I know you do some integrity work on the gas side. We always focused on your large pipe and gathering shale activity on the pipeline side. But are you watching what's happening in terms of M&A there? And does that present an opportunity for yourselves?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, we've predicted that there was going to be a convergence of both the electric power and natural gas companies. We expected that. I mean, one of the primary drivers there is the coal-to-gas switching and the need for significant natural gas infrastructure to feed these power plants, which is one of the big growth drivers on mainline pipe. And certainly it's an opportunity for our customers on the electric side who have to ensure reliable power delivery that those pipeline systems are within their control.","So, yes, we're seeing some convergence of those industries in our customer base, and we have been positioning our company to take advantage of that by having the diversity to serve both the electric power and oil and gas segments. And I think it can't do anything but help us down the road, from a strategic standpoint, as our customers are looking to contractors like Quanta to provide a broader solution to them across their entire portfolio.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","All right. Thanks a lot, Jim.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Matt Duncan at Stephens.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Hey, Matt.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Jim, I'm going to kind of, sort of try to get a view on 2016 from a little bit different angle. If you were to not see any large electrical transmission projects awarded to you that you would begin work on next year, would you be able to grow that business on the top line, just based on the small to medium-sized projects that you're seeing, or would that be difficult to do without large projects?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","I think that would be difficult to do without large projects, if we didn't see any mainline \u2013 new transmission projects, I think we would probably have \u2013 it'd be flattish to slight negative. But I think the bottom line still could grow, particularly since we had some job issues and some weather issues in 2015. So, we got a pretty good comp against 2015 to grow the bottom line. So I think there's two different dynamics working there. We certainly feel confident that the bottom line can grow on 2016 over 2015 in the Electric Power segment.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then in Oil and Gas, a couple of things. Can you give us a little bit of color on what types of projects you're seeing out there in the bid environment? Are you seeing the implied margins in these bids get any better as this market's beginning tighten? I mean, we're seeing good backlog growth across the industry. And given what you are expecting in mainline pipeline work, is it fair to say that that business ought to grow around 10% or perhaps better next year, given the sort of pace of backlog growth we're seeing out of you guys?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. I mean, I think if you look at backlog as a key indicator, you would expect that we would have a double-digit type growth on the top line if projects move through the permitting process as we expect. In order for it to have that material impact that we expect, mainline to have that material impact that we expect next year, I would expect that that you would have that type of growth profile. And we've talked about that in the past, we've talked about 2016, we would start seeing a material uptick in mainline pipe construction opportunities.","As far as the margins, I think the margin profile is really driven a lot by the contract types and the strategic alliances that we have with many of our customers on mainline. We're building multi-year programs for them and the contractual relationship is different, and it's more of a shared risk and it's conducive to us having more stable margins in that sector. Certainly we have to execute, but I think it's more favorable for us in the industry. You'll see a better margin profile going forward.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Yes, I think the margins that you guys said that segment can do are 9% to 12%. I'm assuming with the mix shifting back to mainline, you ought to be in that range next year?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Matt, this is Derrick. Yeah. I would tell you that thematically, you're \u2013 I wouldn't disagree with that. I think one of the main things that would probably get me pause is saying that's unique to next year \u2013 as we sit here today, as from a guidance perspective, and we'll be trying to address that clearly as we move forward into, as Jim said, a February timeframe when we give our ultimate guidance. But when we look at the last half of this year and push out at the mainline jobs, and you look at ultimately how our margins in the third quarter and kind of implied fourth quarter margins in that segment, you can see how those delays in projects can individually impact the margin profile.","And so as we stand here today, as Jim had said on the timing of those awards and\/or their actual permitting and moving to construction, to the extent that we see any of the latter half of next year get pushed at all, then you'd see some impact in that 9% to 12% dynamic.","That's why at this stage, we're not quite at the spot of quantifying. But what I'd say is that, whether from a volume perspective, and if you look out over the multiple quarters exclusive of the finite 2016 period, then I'd say that we think that there's a volume of work there that should still allow us to overall operate at 9% to 12%. We're just not yet quantifying that to 2016 based upon that risk (49:57).","Operator","And we'll go next to Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. I know you guys have been hesitant to let key resources go while big projects are still in the works. But what are you doing to improve your cost position and margins, particularly in electric? And I guess what timing would you have to see in terms of these big projects in order to make a decision to be more aggressive in cost actions?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","I don't want to give the impression that we haven't let anybody go. I mean, we've had some of our operating units adjusting costs in areas regionally that we have seen some softness. But it is imperative that we maintain some critical personnel and some specialized equipment to execute on these larger projects.","It's a fluid situation, Steve. I can't give you a black and white answer that says that in January or March, if we don't see improvement, we're going to make some significant cuts. But I do want to reiterate that we understand where we need to be as a company and as a management team with our margin profile. And we will continue to be diligent on that, and evaluate the environment on a (51:20) basis and make the decisions when necessary.","I think we said that the expectation is that we're going to have a better year in 2016 than we did in 2015, and we're going to have a better year in the Electric Power segment on the bottom line in 2016 than in 2015. So, there will have to be \u2013 either we're going to get mainline work or we're going to have to make some adjustments. So, it's \u2013 I mean, excuse me, large transmission work or make adjustments. But I can't put a time line on that.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And on the \u2013 sticking with the electric business, with revenues down 15% in the quarter, FX sounds like there was only about a 3% impact. So, still a double-digit decline. And I know, Jim, you really can't predict the large transmission project timing, and that's very fair. But are there any other things that you can see with high degree of confidence that will moderate that double-digit pace over the next few quarters, be it acquisitions or anything like that? And then if it's still a double-digit pace of decline, is that a scenario where you can still feel like you can grow your bottom line in Electric Power?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, I want to say that on the full year, we expect growth on an organic basis. As we go into the first half of next year, we have seasonality, for one thing. And I do expect that some of the fourth quarter dynamics will likely transition into the first part of next year.","So we have large projects in backlog that we expect will accelerate or move into construction at some point in time during the year, I just don't want to predict right now when that's going to happen. But I do expect the Electric Power segment to perform better on the bottom line organically than what it has in 2015.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to William Bremer at Maxim Group.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Good morning, gentlemen, and appreciate the color.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning, Bill.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Bill.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","You mentioned \u2013 you called out integrity, and I'd like to go there first. Can you give us a sense, the master service agreements that are attached to that? What size \u2013 how many years do these contracts go out, and can you give us a sense of the top diameters that you're working with there, on these pipelines? That's the first question.","Second, love to get an update on two markets that you didn't voice today, which would be Australia as well as Canada, and just give us a sense of what's happening there now, and the strategy going forward if they don't improve?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. Thank you, Bill. As far as the integrity work, the asset scenario, our business continues to grow. We continue to expand there. We do have master service agreements in place for several customers. They range from three to five years on average, the PG&E contract being kind of the flagship for that type of contract.","The size of pipes range. They vary. You've got cast iron replacement programs, we've got some smaller diameter pipe, anywhere from 2-inch residential pipe programs to 42-inch mainline programs in rural \u2013 or municipal areas. So, the pipe sizes range the full gamut.","As far as comments on Australia, I mean, Australia has been hit hard by the oil price and China's growth slowing, so the exports are less than what we anticipated when we first entered that market. But with that said, it's still an area that we are excited to be in on the ground floor, and we will continue to build that business over a multiyear basis. I think it's going to be important to Quanta five years from now, the contributions from Australia and other international areas like Canada and Latin America will be important five years from now.","But we are going to see the Canadian \u2013 in Alberta \u2013 Alberta, Australia and the Gulf of Mexico have been impacted by the price of oil. I don't expect much more downturn in those areas. I think they've settled out. In fact, we are seeing some areas return to some level of growth as some of the competitors, the smaller competitors in those markets, have exited. But it's a real tough situation that we're monitoring. But any softness in those markets will certainly be made up by the mainline revenue that we expect to move to construction over the next several years.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Rogers at D.A. Davidson.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Hi. Good morning.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning, John.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, John.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Just a little more color, if I could, in terms of the T&D vertical, the electrical business. Jim, what's the margin that's in your backlog now, or directionally, versus what you've just seen? I mean, you're \u2013 and the confidence. I'm just trying to get to the confidence that it gets better next year, with or without those big transmission projects?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, John. Actually, it's Derrick. From a margin perspective in backlog on Electric Power, what I say is, we are going to have an online \u2013 a bit of pressure on those margins. It's not so much, though, from the standpoint of what we're doing from a bidding perspective. It's much of what we're seeing more from the standpoint of our expectations of the performance against that work, primarily from the dynamic of what Jim spoke about.","We've got T&D resources from the large transmission work that have been moved over, and some of those resources are working on some of that smaller transmission work. And so, to that extent, as we think about how we expect that backlog to perform, arguably structurally, we have to believe that it's going to perform at a lower rate.","That doesn't necessarily translate into our aspect of bidding it lower, but it's just that what we are saying now is that, based upon this performance, we're going to say that we think it'll currently execute at a slightly lower rate.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just on the pipeline side, or the Oil and Gas side of the business, can you give us \u2013 because it sounds like \u2013 I mean, we're going to take another step down in margins here, before they recover. And how much excess overhead are you carrying there now? Or maybe another way to ask it is, what's your capacity to do work in that segment?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, certainly, our fixed costs in the Oil and Gas segment have continued to increase, because we've got to prepare for this mainline pipe...","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Right.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","... expansion. So, there is some impact there, and that is a drag on margins, especially when we expected some of these programs to start in the fourth quarter of this year, and they've been pushed. So, now we've got so much work coming in 2016 that we're probably going to see some pushes, but we're still going to have probably a pretty nice uptick in revenues in that segment, with mainline contributions, even with pushes, because there's just so much work that's supposed to move the construction in 2016.","You also have the Canadian dynamic with seasonality, and seasonality going on right now. So, you got to be prepared, because if the ground freezes, you're going to go work, and there's going to be a significant amount of it in Canada during this time of the year. If it doesn't, you're not going to mobilize. So, you've just got that dynamic going on. But we certainly have a higher fixed cost in that business today than we did last year, because you can't just turn the switch on and start working on the amount of mainline projects that we expect. You've got to prepare for that, and that takes time, and it costs money to do so.","Operator","And we'll go next to Alex Rygiel with FBR Capital Market.","Min Chung Cho - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. Good morning. This is Min Cho for Alex. Thanks for taking my question.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning, Min.","Min Chung Cho - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Good morning. Given the uncertainty about some of the timing of the backlog and moving into construction phase, do you feel \u2013 I mean, how conservative is your 12-month backlog number? Is there still a certain amount of risk to that number?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, our backlog, we've been consistent the way we book backlog, and it's typically once we get it, executed, contract or some form of executed contract from the customer, it goes into backlog. So, I would say that the way we book backlog is very conservative, and I have not seen any fixed price contract that's gone into backlog, ever to my knowledge, get pulled out of backlog. I mean, once it's in backlog, it moves to construction.","We've made MSA adjustments from time to time; back in 2008 and 2009, when we went into the banking crisis, we had to adjust MSAs and backlog. But as far as lump-sum fixed-price contracts, I would say that I'm very \u2013 with a high degree of confidence that if it hits backlog, it's going to construction.","Min Chung Cho - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Right. I guess I'm concerned more with the 12-month backlog number, and the potential for push-outs of projects beyond that 12 months?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, okay. I understand. I think that, again, you're probably going to have pushes in 12-month backlog, because we've seen pushes over the last three to four years. And nothing's changed in that dynamic. But what's different is that there's going to be a significant amount of mainline work. I mean, we booked, as we talked today on the call, several billion dollars' worth of mainline projects, many of which will be moving to construction or planned to move to construction in 2016. Will you have some pushes in that backlog? Absolutely. I would say it's almost certain you're going to have some pushes.","But with what's left that does go in 2016, it's still going to be material and more than what we've seen here in 2015. So \u2013 but we will have some pushes out of backlog.","Min Chung Cho - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","There's no question in my mind that that'll happen. But it's not going to impact our excitement about what moves the revenue in 2016.","Min Chung Cho - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. That's fair. Also, I know you've been asked this question in the past and you've been fairly conservative about the opportunity in Mexico kind of for natural gas pipe. Any change in the strategy there?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","No. I mean, Mexico continues to be an area that we recognize there'll be significant amount of opportunities there. And it just depends upon our customer base, especially some of our key customers, whether they move down there and they want us to move with them in more of a collaborative partnership-type role. We continue to evaluate it, but it is a higher-risk area than Canada and the United States, for sure, and there's a lot of work for us to do here in Canada and the U.S. So we'll go to Mexico if we can mitigate the risk, or we'll evaluate going to Mexico if we can mitigate the risk. But right now, our opportunities are in Canada and in the U.S.","Operator","We'll go next to Jamie Cook at Credit Suisse.","Ben E. Xiao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning. This is actually Ben on for Jamie. So two questions for Derrick. First, I guess going back to the margins. I appreciate you can't quantify your expectations for 2016, but can you at least help us with your expectations by segment for Q4, just so we can get a better sense for run rate into 2016? And then second, just on the free cash flow. I mean, conversion's been pretty good year-to-date. I know it will come down in Q4, but how should we think about 2016, just because this mainline ramps up, I imagine more cash will be tied up in working capital?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Actually, I'm starting with your last question. I think that's a fair assumption for 2016, exactly right. The mainline projects have a tendency to be fairly rapid ramp-ups and be sizable projects that happen over a short period of time. And so, depending on the timing of that, you can see a pretty substantial draw of that capital. And then from a timing perspective, then of course it depends on how much of that work is coming in the fourth quarter as to whether, if any of that gets pushed, whether that would turn into cash in 2016, or just continue to roll and maybe such that it goes into 2017. So I do believe it's a fair expectation that 2016 cash flow will be lower than 2015 cash flow.","From a margin perspective on the fourth quarter, I can comment that I'd say Electric Power is probably going to be in or around the 7% or 8% range, we'll say, and in Oil and Gas because of timing it's probably going to be like in, say, the 4% to 5% range. One thing though, you made the comment about estimating a run rate for 2016. I don't know that I would be looking at those fourth quarter margins to be indicative of run rates, per se. One of the main things to recall, remember, is the seasonality aspect of the business. I mean, it's typical for our fourth quarter margins to drift based upon the lower revenues or weather dynamics and seasonality, let alone the fact of the impact of some of the mainline awards, et cetera.","So that's kind of how the fourth quarter would lay out, but I'd be hesitant to say exactly how that's going to impact 2016 at this stage.","Ben E. Xiao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks a lot. Very helpful.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","Operator","And we'll go next to Vishal Shah at Deutsche Bank.","Vish B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jim, I apologize if this has been already asked, but could you maybe just talk about how you think the backlog is in terms of what percentage of your backlog has cleared permitting and how much still needs regulatory approval for 2016?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","It's in various stages, Vishal. I would say that once a project moves to backlog, in general, most of the permitting and siting has been done, and there's a path to construction. In other words, they see that they should be able to get through the remaining hurdles. Typically if projects are challenged to get permits, that they don't move to construction, typically, to the construction phase or to backlog. But I would say that, in general, there's a path to getting these projects fully permitted into construction, if they're in backlog.","Vish B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And what kind of visibility did you have in the large transmission side in terms of the permitting process? I mean, what are your customers telling you in terms of timelines, and how do you plan for that when you think about the workflows that you have on standby for some of those projects? Thank you.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, I mean, I think that's an art more than a science. And we're in constant discussion with our customers, so we have a pretty good feel for when projects will move to construction. I mean, obviously, we've had some surprises, some of our customers \u2013 I mean, really, the overall profile on backlog, as far as projects moving from backlog to construction, hasn't changed. It's just that projects are bigger and cover longer distances in more populous areas, so it's just a little bit more of a sensitive process for our customers to get through. But we're certainly in constant communication with our customers and we try to plan our resources accordingly, to the best that we can.","Operator","We'll go next to Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Hey. Good morning, guys.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Jim, these potential delays on the pipeline side, what do you think about that? Is that all permitting, or are you \u2013 because these MLPs, the stocks are down, they're talking about less access to capital. Does that matter, too, or is it just all permits?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","It's mostly all permits. I mean, the country needs big pipe. And despite what's going on with the MLPs and the issues that you mentioned, I mean, you've got to get product moved, you've got to get this natural gas to these markets, and that's the shale. The shales are shut down in many areas because they don't have takeaway capacity, especially in the Marcellus and Utica.","And the coal-to-gas switching is creating an environment where our customers need redundant gas pipeline systems in order to feed these power plants \u2013 these new gas-powered plants. So the need for the big pipe is there, regardless of the economic situation or the MLP environment, and that's what the big driver is on the pipeline boom that we expect, or increase in mainline pipe that we expect over the next several years.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. That's helpful. And then on the transmission side, relative to two or three or four years ago, have you seen increased competition?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","No. I mean, it's the same people in the industry. I mean, you might see a company move into the business, but they're tapping into the same resource base. I mean, again you've got a limited amount of superintendents and foremen in this industry. It's a very specialized industry, that field leadership is extremely important, in my opinion, in order to be successful as a contractor. This business has only ramped up really in a big way five years ago, and it's really put a strain on the industry, especially at the field leadership position where it could take a decade or more to train a qualified journeyman lineman that moves to a general foreman or a superintendent position.","So I really haven't seen the competitive environment change with the blue-collar workforce that executes on the work. And I think that's the most important aspect of what we do, is having those self-perform capabilities, and I have not seen a significant shift, if at all, in that area of our business.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Jeffrey Volshteyn at JPMorgan.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I'm going to be quick. So just, Jim, following on your commentary on large electric projects, I surely understand the complexity around permitting, particularly in large metropolitan areas. But perhaps you can give us a little bit of color of where the delays are coming from. Is that local agencies? Is it federal agencies? And maybe in certain geographies or certain functions that are being consistently slower in permitting?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, I don't want to sound flippant with that question, but it's all of the above. I mean, it's become more complicated, and when you get into \u2013 I mean, it's every single municipality, it's every county, it's every state, and it's a very difficult process for our customers to get through, especially in the more populous areas of the United States and Canada. You just have more jurisdictions and you've got more permitting, and it just takes time. And it's no different than really 10 years ago. I mean, some of the first transmission projects that we started building in 2011 were in the permitting process for 10 to 15 years in California to get approved.","So, it just takes time, and it's not a matter of if this infrastructure gets built, it's when. And the environmental groups have become more organized, and so forth. You see that in the media. It's just a more difficult environment, but what's frustrating us is to predict when these projects move or forecast when these projects move to construction.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Do you feel that these projects are appropriately funded, and there's not a funding issue as well?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","It's not a funding issue for the customers that we're working for, no. Many of our customers have \u2013 when you look at the pipeline, companies that have firm shipping agreements in place \u2013 shipper agreements in place to build the infrastructure, and our customers who need to build pipeline infrastructure to feed power plants and so forth, it's not a independent pipeline company that owns that project that has a shipper agreement in place, it's a utility that gets recouped through the rate base. So, financing's not an issue with the projects that we see in our backlog.","Operator","And at this time, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Okay.

Jim?","James F. O'Neil","Thank you, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services' Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with an operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our third quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","Quanta continues to execute in all operating segments at higher levels. Compared to the third quarter of last year, revenue increased 32% to a record $2.17 billion, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share increased 33% to $0.61, and backlog increased 19% to a record $9.63 billion. These solid results reflect Quanta's leadership position and ability to capitalize on opportunities for growth in a dynamic energy infrastructure market.","Electric power segment revenues grew more than 31% during the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, excluding the effect of a charge associated with the previously completed Sunrise Powerlink transmission project, our electric power segment operating income margins returned to normal levels in the third quarter after experiencing margin pressure during the second quarter due to the challenging effects of extreme winter weather and late breakup in Canada and the northern parts of the United States.","During the quarter, Nalcor Energy selected Valard Construction, a Quanta company, to install transmission infrastructure for the Labrador-Island Transmission Link project. This is the largest transmission project that Quanta has ever been awarded and one of the largest high-voltage transmission projects to be built in Canada. It is also the second major transmission project awarded to Quanta by Nalcor Energy over the past 12 months, the first being the Muskrat Falls project in December of last year.","For the Labrador-Island Transmission Link project, Quanta will install approximately 684 miles of 350-kilovolt overhead high-voltage direct current transmission line running from the Muskrat Falls Hydroelectric Generating Facility in Central Labrador to Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula. Our scope of work includes all construction aspects of the project, including geomatic services, management of right-of-way clearing, access and reclamation, installation of concrete foundations, tower assembly and erection and conductor stringing.","We have mobilized resources for this project and expect the project to be completed during the summer of 2017.","Also, during the third quarter, Quanta was selected by Southern California Edison for the 500-kilovolt underground project for the Chino Hills segment of the Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project. Construction on this project has begun, and we expect to complete the project during the first half of 2016.","Though these 2 projects are very different from one another, both are extremely challenging, and Quanta was selected because we have the skilled resources and track record for safely completing complex projects in the electric transmission marketplace.","Our utility customers have made significant investments in the electric power infrastructure throughout North America over the past several years, especially in transmission, and we expect continued strong levels of investment by utilities in transmission and distribution infrastructure in the foreseeable future.","The dynamic spurring North American transmission and distribution investment that we have discussed on our earnings calls for the past several years continue to drive our customers to invest in the electric power infrastructure going forward. The most significant drivers include: an aging power grid, the majority of which is approaching or beyond the end of its useful life that is long not configured to serve the population centers of today; the changing mix of power generation, including the increase in renewable generation development and a switch from coal to natural gas-fired generation. As a result of these dynamics, new transmission and related infrastructure is required to interconnect these new generation sources to the grid, and existing infrastructure needs to be upgraded, replaced and modified to accommodate the shifting generation mix; and finally, new regulation and the implementation of existing regulation are significant drivers of infrastructure investment, such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005, NERC reliability requirements, Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, the recently passed critical infrastructure protection standard and the implementation of FERC Order 1000.","Demand for our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services remains strong, driven by the development of unconventional shale plays in North America, the Canadian oil sands and the coal seam gas in Australia. Our Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment revenues grew significantly and our operating income margins expanded as compared to the third quarter of last year due to favorable end-market demand and increased contribution from mainline pipeline projects in North America and Australia.","Despite the recent decline in oil prices, our customers continue to move forward with the development of unconventional shale and Canadian oil sands infrastructure as well as mainline pipeline programs. We have seen no indication that related customer capital programs will be curtailed. While further and sustained declines of commodity pricing could impact our customers' investment plans for a period of time, there are several things to consider as it relates to Quanta's Oil and Gas Infrastructure business.","The unconventional shales in North America and the Canadian oil sands are game-changing dynamics in the energy industry. We believe our customers are strategically planning and investing in the long-term infrastructure they need to transport these new resources of hydrocarbons over the next several decades, not just years. The complexity, costs and challenges to design and gain regulatory approvals, permits and right-of-way for large infrastructure projects, such as mainline projects, requires longer-term planning and commitment. We believe the industry outlook for our Oil and Gas Infrastructure and, in particular, for mainline pipeline programs remains positive for the foreseeable future.","In fact, subsequent to quarter-end, we entered into or expanded multiple long-term agreements with customers to build mainline infrastructure over the next several years. Due to confidentiality agreements with our customers, we are not able to provide any more specific details about these arrangements at this time. However, we expect a meaningful increase in mainline pipe construction activity throughout 2015 and beyond. We also continue to believe that industry capacity to build large-diameter mainline pipeline will be pushed to the limits to serve customer demand in both 2015 and 2016 and perhaps beyond.","As it relates to our gathering activities, the majority of our gathering work is performed in the Marcellus and Utica Shales, which are primarily driven by the production of natural gas and natural gas liquids. As a result, our gathering operations are not significantly exposed to the price of oil, and the Marcellus and Utica natural gas trades at a discount rate due to the lack of infrastructure available to take product from these areas to end markets. Therefore, we see continued solid demand for our services into the foreseeable future.","And finally, our Fiber Optic Licensing operations continue to perform well. Demand for our dark fiber network remains solid, and our lit service rollout continues to progress in our Northeast markets. We are engaging current and potential new customers with the broad platform of private network communication solutions that we offer, and we see attractive growth opportunities over the next several years as our lit services offering gains traction in 2015 and beyond.","In summary, our operations performed well in the third quarter, and for the first 9 months of 2014, end-market drivers remained firmly in place and demand for our specialty infrastructure services is strong. Based on these factors and the visibility we have into new project awards going forward, we expect strong backlog levels for the foreseeable future.","From a qualitative perspective, we continue to believe that our end markets provide the opportunity for double-digit growth through at least 2015. In addition, based on what we see and understand today, we believe 2016 is likely to be a year with continued growth opportunity. We expect to provide our formal 2015 financial guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in February of next year.","Our qualitative outlook for our business is largely shaped by our collaborative relationships with our customers, which gives us a valuable insight into their multiyear infrastructure capital programs. As I hope you have taken away from my comments this morning, we continue to have momentum as we move through the remainder of 2014 and are excited about the potential we see for 2015 and beyond.","I will now like to turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his financial review of the third quarter. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $2.17 billion for the third quarter of 2014 compared to $1.65 billion in the prior year's third quarter, reflecting an increase of 32% in quarter-over-quarter revenues.","Net income attributable to common stock for the quarter was $94.6 million or $0.43 per diluted share as compared to $92.9 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year.","Included in net income attributable to common stock for the third quarter of 2014 was a $52.5 million charge or $32.3 million net of tax to a provision for long-term contract receivable. This receivable is related to a previously disclosed change order of $165 million on the Sunrise Powerlink project and Electric Power Infrastructure Services project that began in 2010 and was completed in 2012. The receivable is currently the subject of an ongoing arbitration proceeding.","As part of our ongoing assessment of this asset's recoverability under GAAP, a provision of $52.5 million was recognized in the 3 months ended September 30, 2014, as a charge to selling, general and administrative expense to reflect changes in our assessment of the flexibility of amounts owed to us by the customer.","As discussed in prior quarters, operational and contractual decisions made by us during the performance of this work are based upon verbal assurances from the customer and we relied on those representations. These assurances, coupled with our previous legal strategy, supported the view that the full amount of the change order would be collectible. However, during the third quarter of 2014, we continue to evaluate the legal theories and strategies that would be most advantageous to pursue in arbitration. This resulted in a change in our expected arbitration strategy, which also caused us to reassess our settlement strategy and our views on estimated settlement outcomes. As a result, we recorded an adjustment to the net realizable value of the Sunrise receivable in the current period in accordance with GAAP. This revised value is based on a range of possible outcomes, and we continue to pursue all alternatives to resolve this matter, including settlement discussions and arbitrations, if necessary, and we still intend to pursue collection of amounts in excess of this revised value. However, the matter is currently in arbitration and is therefore subject to risks and uncertainties.","The net impact of this provision on Quanta's results for the third quarter of 2014 was a reduction of $0.15 per diluted share. Additionally, included in our results for the third quarters of 2014 and 2013 were the releases of the income tax contingencies of approximately $4.9 million and $6.6 million of income or net benefit of $0.02 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2014 and a net benefit of $0.03 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2013, both due to the expiration of various state and federal statute of limitation periods.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share, as presented in today's press release, was $0.61 for the third quarter of 2014 as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.46 for the third quarter of 2013.","The increase in consolidated revenues in the third quarter of 2014 was, compared to the same quarter last year, was primarily due to a 31.6% increase in revenues from our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment and a 35.7% increase in revenues from our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment.","Incremental revenues contributed during the quarter from acquired companies are estimated around $195 million, which indicates that organic growth in consolidated revenues was in the double-digit range of approximately 20%. Our consolidated gross margin was 16.3% in the third quarter of 2014, which is comparable to 16.6% in the third quarter of 2013.","Selling, general and administrative expenses, as presented in this quarter's press release, were $148 million in the third quarter of 2014, reflecting an increase of $23 million as compared to last year's third quarter. This increase is primarily due to $15.4 million in incremental G&A costs associated with acquired companies and approximately $4 million in higher salaries and benefits costs related -- and related ancillary administration costs associated with the current levels of operations, partially offset by lower levels of incentive compensation.","Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 6.8% in the third quarter of 2014 as compared to 7.6% in the third quarter of 2013, which reflects better cost absorption from higher overall levels of revenues.","Our consolidated operating margin before amortization expense was 7% for 3Q '14, which was impacted by approximately 240 basis points due to the charge to provision and compares to a 9% consolidated operating margin in 3Q '13.","Amortization of intangible assets increased to $9.5 million in the third quarter of 2014 from $7 million in 3Q '13, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions that have closed since the third quarter of last year.","To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues were $1.38 billion, reflecting an increase of $330.8 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 31.6%. Revenues during the quarter were positively impacted by increased activities from electric power transmission, distribution and power generation projects, which resulted primarily from increased capital spending of our customers as well as an estimated $65 million in revenues generated by acquired companies.","Operating margin in the electric power segment decreased to 7.5% in the third quarter of 2014 as compared to 11.7% in last year's third quarter, primarily due to the effects of the charge to provision for long-term contract receivable. Also contributing to the decrease were slightly lower margins earned quarter-over-quarter associated with typical project variability as well as lower margins earned on certain power generation projects ongoing during the third quarter of 2014 as compared to those ongoing during the third quarter of 2013.","Sequentially, as of September 30, 2014, both 12-month and total backlog for the electric power segment increased by 6.5% and 10.6%, primarily due to certain larger contract awards and, to a lesser extent, from acquired companies. Quarter-over-quarter, 12-month and total backlog increased 19% and 21.9% as compared to the third quarter of 2013.","Oil and gas segment revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by $197.4 million or 35.7% to $749.8 million in 3Q '14, largely as a result of revenue contributions of an estimated $130 million from acquired companies, but additionally from strong organic growth associated with increased capital spending by our customers.","Operating income for the oil and gas segment as a percentage of revenues increased to 10% in 3Q '14 from 9% in 3Q '13. This increase is primarily due to the contribution from mainline pipeline projects in the U.S. and Australia, which typically offer higher margin opportunities as well as better fixed cost absorption due to higher revenues.","Quarter-over-quarter, 12-month and total backlog for the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment increased by 25% and 14.9% when compared to the third quarter of 2013 as a result of acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, new project awards. Sequentially, backlog grew for both 12-month and total backlog by 23.8% and 14.9%.","Our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment revenues were down $2.2 million or 5% to $42.1 million in 3Q '14 as compared to $44.4 million in 3Q '13 due to lower levels of ancillary telecommunication services revenues.","Operating margin increased to 32.8% in 3Q '14 as compared to 31.8% in 3Q '13, primarily due to a change in revenue mix with relatively fewer revenues derived from ancillary telecommunication services, which typically carry lower margins.","Corporate and unallocated costs increased $3.4 million in the third quarter 2014 as compared to 3Q '13, primarily as a result of $2.5 million increase in amortization expense due to the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets from recent acquisitions. EBITA for the third quarter of 2014 was $146.7 million or 6.8% of revenues compared to $141.8 million or 8.6% of revenues for the third quarter of 2013.","Adjusted EBITDA was $249.5 million or 11.5% of revenues for the third quarter of 2014 compared to $185.8 million or 11.3% of revenues for the third quarter of 2013.","This calculation of EBITA, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are all non-GAAP measures and the definitions of these and Days Sales Outstanding or DSO can be found in the Investors & Media section of our website at quantaservices.com.","For the third quarter of 2014, cash flow provided by operations was approximately $64 million, and net capital expenditures were approximately $77 million, resulting in approximately $13 million of negative free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $37 million for the third quarter of 2013. The decrease in free cash flow was primarily driven by increased working capital requirements associated with the current period's increased levels of operating activity.","DSOs were 83 days at September 30, 2014, compared to 72 days at December 31, 2013, and 82 days at September 30, 2013.","Impacting our investing cash flows during the third quarter of 2014 was the closing of 2 acquisitions, which included cash consideration of approximately $81.8 million net of cash acquired.","At September 30, 2014, we had about $320 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments, and we had $76.9 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $144 million in cash with approximately $44 million in U.S. funds and $100 million relating to our foreign operations.","Including our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we had nearly $1.1 billion in total liquidity as of September 30, 2014.","Concerning our outlook. We expect revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 to range between $1.95 billion and $2.05 billion and diluted earnings per share to be $0.46 to $0.48 on a GAAP basis. Included in our estimate of GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 is a net tax benefit of approximately $0.02 per share associated with the release of certain income tax contingencies due to the expiration of certain statute of limitations periods during the quarter.","These estimates compare to revenues of $1.82 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.77 in the fourth quarter of 2013, which included a $0.32 per diluted share impact from the gain on the sale of Quanta's equity interest in Howard Midstream Energy Partners, coupled with the net tax benefit of approximately $0.03 per share from the release of income tax contingencies in 4Q '13.","Our GAAP EPS forecast for the fourth quarter of 2014 includes an estimate of $7.8 million for noncash stock-based compensation expense and $9.5 million for amortization expense. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2014 is expected to be $0.50 to $0.52 and compares to our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.50 in the fourth quarter of 2013.","We are currently forecasting net income attributable to noncontrolling interests to be approximately $2 million to $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. For additional guidance, we are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate to be between 32% and 33% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and our diluted share count to be about 219.9 million shares.","It's important to note that we exceeded our third quarter expectations in part due to some revenues being pulled from the fourth quarter into the third quarter due to solid production this quarter. With that said, with respect to the company's fourth quarter outlook, we do see growth in electric power revenues when compared to last year's fourth quarter and a degree of normal fourth quarter seasonality when compared to the third quarter of 2014 revenues. However, although our margin expectations are still within our normal 10% to 12% guidance for the segment, certain projects reached or near completion during the fourth quarter. With fourth quarter weather variability, we've tried to prudently consider these potential dynamics on our guidance and currently anticipate margins at the lower end of our 10% to 12% range.","With regard to the oil and gas segment, the timing of mainline project is such that lesser work is occurring in this year's fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter as well as the earlier quarters of 2014. This project timing likely will lead to little or no revenue growth in the oil and gas segment in comparison to the prior year's fourth quarter, which we anticipate will lower margins for 4Q '14 to the upper single-digit range.","Taking into consideration the results of the third quarter and our fourth quarter guidance, we currently anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year to be between $1.51 to $1.53.","In addition, we anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $1.97 to $1.99, which is slightly higher than the midpoint of our original 2014 annual guidance for adjusted EPS and represents growth of approximately 16% as compared to last year's adjusted EPS of $1.71.","Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share presented in our release.","We expect CapEx for all of 2014 to be approximately $320 million to $330 million, which includes CapEx for our fiber licensing and other segment of about $50 million to $60 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2013 of $264 million.","Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and the repurchase of Quanta stock.","This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess the first question was going to be on fourth quarter guidance, but I think that was very eloquently explained by Derrick, so I'll move to the other 2 questions I had. First one is just on free cash flow outlook into next year. If you can provide any guidance versus where net income should be. Should we see both converging into next year? And Jim, given your stock over the last -- currently, it's trading probably at the low end of its 5-year historicals on -- close to every metric. Could you talk a bit about cash allocation and repurchases? We didn't see much in this quarter. That's kind of my first question.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, Tahira, this is Derrick. Relative to '15 cash flow, the working capital demands of our business are usually the first place that -- the biggest driver relative to cash flow in general. When I look at 2014 at this stage in the game, I would expect that I have a strong fourth quarter cash flow, but I don't think I'll get to the level of saying that I have cash flow comparable to '13 for this year, probably because of the dynamics of net working capital. I still think though that overall, I mean, cash flow will continue to be strong. I think that 2015 is probably something that's going to be in order of magnitude of -- from a contribution perspective, in the same ratios as you've seen relative to the '13 type dynamic. The -- and then relative to stock repurchase, I mean, we're opportunistic with stock repurchase. We have a much broader program, a $500 million program. We did do $45 million last quarter. You're correct, we did not buy back any stock this quarter. Lots of things influenced that between the timing of awards, timing of cash flow for project acquisitions, any number of different factors that are taken into consideration. But we do think that we'll be very optimistic relative to cash -- I mean, stock repurchase as we go forward.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. And Jim, the second question is really in regards to pipeline space. You've talked that you've received some long-term agreements that were anticipated from key clients, so congratulations on that. Typically, when you've done agreements such as these in the past on the transmission side, you've seen some incremental bookings alongside it. So if you can comment on the timing of initial bookings for these particular agreements. And as you see the construction starts for some of this work into 2015?","James F. O'Neil","Yes. It's a good question, Tahira. I think it's going to be a mix. You're going to see some projects move into backlog, which will be reflected as we move through '15. I think you'll see strong backlog in mainline. But also under these agreements, some of the projects that have potential to move to construction over the next several years won't be put into backlog until we're certain they move to construction. So it'll be a mix, a mix of projects going into backlog and then the opportunities under these agreements to build programs that won't go into backlog until there's more clarity on those programs going forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The oil and gas margins were strong in the quarter, and annually, they've been rising. What's your confidence that the margins there can continue to improve from the 2014 levels? I know you mentioned capacity and the market's going to be pushed to its limits. Or should we just be thinking about overall profit dollars?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, Steve. I mean, I think that we've talked about the contributions of mainline will continue to push us in the opportunities of the 9% to 12% range. You've seen that within this year, most specifically in the second and third quarter, which was largely because of those mainline contributions. Our historical performance in that space is such that we have seen that 9% to 12% margin on that execution on mainline. And as we go into '15, I think a lot of Jim's commentary is, first, to get larger contributions. And so I think those combinations puts us very comfortable that we'll be within that range.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then how long does your backlog in Canadian pipeline extend right now? And kind of when do you need to start replenishing that? And then how do you think about how that business fares there in a lower-priced environment?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I wouldn't say it's a lower-priced environment. I would say that the price environment in mainline is going to be strong going forward. I would say that most of the backlog that we have today in Canada is in 2015. We do have some that spills into '16. But I think as we move through the year, next year, you're going to see lower -- you're going to see backlog build in mainline and it could have a multiyear feel to it. Sorry, Steve, I misunderstood your question on the low price of oil. I think that there's a couple of things here. One, I think people forget that pipeline is the most cost-effective way to move products. So in some way, this is positive for the pipeline market because rail and trucking of commodities or oil is becoming -- is going to be -- is going to move into being not very cost effective under the current price of these commodities. And secondly, many of our customers have longer-term agreements with shippers that are in place today. I mean, they wouldn't have started spending the capital that they have on some of these programs to get permitting and signing done and buying product and so forth if they didn't have commitments from customers. So I'm pretty confident at this point in time that many of the projects and opportunities we see are going to move forward. That's not to say that a further decline in oil pricing could impact our business in some areas, but I do think that we're going to have quite a bit of activity in '15 and beyond on mainline pipe.","Operator","And next, we'll move on to Noelle Dilts with Stifel.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I just wanted to stick with oil and gas for my first question. I thought there were some positive comments on Australia that you gave in your comments, and was hoping you could expand upon sort of the opportunity set that you're seeing there. And then if you could discuss just the relative amount of bidding activity and opportunities you're seeing in, again, Canada versus the U.S.","James F. O'Neil","Noelle, right now in Australia, it's been the same story, the same market. It's a coal seam gas market. It's been very active for us. It has a multiyear feel. We're the primary contractor from a market position in Queensland, building the pipeline infrastructure. So it's been a very good market for us and it's very consistent, and we do see some growth opportunities there. Canada, I would say that Canada and U.S., the mix of the opportunities that we see on mainline pipe are probably equal right now across Canada and the U.S. going forward. There's activity throughout North America that we believe will ramp up in '15 and beyond.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then shifting to transmission. I think if you look at kind of the awards that we've seen this year in the public sphere, transition awards have been, I think, lower than folks expected, maybe heading into the year. I guess my first question is, is that what you're seeing in the market? Or because you negotiate so much work, are you still seeing a lot of activity and growth in the U.S. transmission market? And then the second piece of that would be if you're expecting awards to accelerate here in the last couple of months of the year and into early '15.","James F. O'Neil","One of the good things about being at Quanta is we do have these relationships with many of the investor-owned utilities and Canadian [indiscernible] and utilities, so we do have a view of what their multiyear transmission programs are. I mean, we're building a majority of the big projects and we pretty much build transmission, whether it's large announced projects or smaller projects, for most of all the investor-owned utilities in the United States. So we see transmission activity continuing to be strong. I wouldn't relate that to just large project awards as being the barometer as to whether we'd beat or whether the business is falling off. We don't see that right now. We see continued large projects and certainly, smaller projects that have momentum. And we feel comfortable that at least through 2015, that transmission continues to have a growth feel to it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Andrew Buscaglia - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Andrew on behalf of Jamie. Just a quick question back to your transmission side. You guys said that Q4 is more trend -- margins are trending more towards the lower end of the 10% to 12% target. And then -- I mean, if you had taken into account Q2, where margins played out there, and then in Q3, you're in line, but excluding the -- including the charge, you're below that targeted range. How do you guys feel about -- I know you don't give 2015 guidance, but how do you feel about your confidence of getting that of -- that margin level back into that targeted range? And what do you see in terms of the market or in terms of what Quanta is doing to improve that?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, this is Derrick. I mean, we feel very comfortable with our 10% to 12% range. We've been executing within that range for quite some time. The second quarter was a real anomaly, I mean, from a weather perspective as it relates to the dynamics that it had on production. I mean, if you recall, it was just an extremely difficult winter and that breakup really came into play in that second quarter. So -- but when I look back over the quarters of the last several years, I mean, we very strongly feel it fit within that 10% to 12% range. So I continue to believe that as we go into '15 and beyond, that we'll continue to execute solidly within that range. The fourth quarter dynamic is such that we may be still yet slightly on the lower end of that range, but I think that you'll still see that we feel very comfortable it'll exceed the 10% range.","Andrew Buscaglia - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just long-term -- switching to your oil and gas segment. I know Mexico has been sort of a topic, given the potential in that market. Are you guys doing anything strategically now to align yourselves in that region? And then in terms of a time line, do you guys see this becoming impactful in '15 or '16? Or what's your thinking as of lately?","James F. O'Neil","Well, we're certainly evaluating the Mexican market. I mean, there's going to be significant infrastructure built there. I think the main thing that everybody needs to remember is that just is another factor on the strain on capacity that's available to build pipeline in North America, and so we see plenty of opportunity to build pipeline in Canada and the United States. We're certainly evaluating Mexico. You can hardly not, because it's such a big opportunity. But right now, our preferred place to build infrastructure is Canada, the United States and in Australia.","Operator","And next, we'll move on to Andy Wittmann with Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Derrick, I wanted to get a better sense of the acquisitions that were completed in the quarter. Could you give us perhaps the backlog contributions to the 2 primary segments as well as the revenue contribution in the quarter from acquisitions in total?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes. The combined acquisitions for the quarter, probably run rate of about $200 million to $250 million. And from a -- as of September 30, what I'd say from a backlog perspective, they probably were about, let's say, about $100 million in total backlog contribution and I'd call that 25-75, 25% probably electric power, 75% oil and gas.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess maybe just to dig into the pipeline segment a little bit more. You kind of mentioned that a lot of the gathering work that you do is in natural gas developments primarily. Maybe Derrick, it would be helpful if you could help us get a relative sense about what gathering -- what percentage of your overall pipeline business, maybe on a year-to-date basis, has been gathering. Just put that in some broader context for us.","James F. O'Neil","I would say, Andy, that gathering is running about $1 billion a year in revenue, maybe a little bit better than that. But that gives you a sense, when you look at the overall segment, what gathering's contribution is.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Jerimiah Booream-Phelps - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Jerimiah on the line for Vishal. Just wanted to delve a little bit more into the geographic breakdown. Obviously, you guys have moved into Australia. I'm wondering if you're seeing any shift more towards Canada and Australia away from the U.S. in both of the major segments.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, this is Derrick. I mean, Canada right now has grown and is now towards probably getting close to a 20% type range. And Australia is probably a little less than 5%. And I think as we go forward right now, I'd expect those relative contributions to stay approximately the same for the near term.","Jerimiah Booream-Phelps - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then also to the extent that you can talk about it, just wanted to touch again on the mainline agreements that you guys signed. What's the sort of margin profile that you're thinking about there as you start to put that into backlog?","James F. O'Neil","The mainline pipe opportunities that we see under these agreements, as Derrick stated earlier, if we execute on that amount of mainline, it should get us into -- well into the 9% to 12% operating income range, provided we execute. I always say that mainline pipe is to the oil and gas segment like electric transmission projects are to the electric power segment. So if we get a good volume of mainline pipe occurring next year, which we're on the road to having a good amount of mainline pipe occurring next year, we have the opportunity to be well within the 9% to 12% operating income range for this segment.","Operator","And next, we'll move on to Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I wanted to ask first on Keystone. If that moves forward, how should we think about that for you guys on the pricing side? Or maybe you can just refresh us because that was the job you announced back in 2011. I mean contractually, if that moves forward, talk a little bit about what we should be thinking there.","James F. O'Neil","Well, we're not thinking about Keystone right now. So it's off the radar right now for us. TransCanada would have to announce that they're moving forward with it and I don't know where they are with that, to be honest with you. I mean -- so I mean, obviously, if Keystone moved forward, it would fit the pricing profile of all of our other mainline pipe programs.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","You're not locked into some 2011 price?","James F. O'Neil","No, we're not -- we don't have a -- no pricing or no contract was signed on Keystone. It was just a -- it was a joint venture that was working toward -- that was put in place that would execute on Keystone, but nothing was signed or committed to on pricing contractually on that project. And the project's going to -- was rerouted anyway. So I mean, it's not even the same program as it was early on. So anyway, that's a TransCanada question, and certainly, if it went forward, that would be great for us potentially. But we really can't comment on Keystone right now.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And then Derrick, the revenue guidance you gave for the oil and gas segment, I think you said down year-over-year. Is that organic? Or is that all in?","Derrick A. Jensen","No. I don't -- I said maybe kind of flat to down, but that is all in, yes. I mean, we had substantial contributions last year from a mainline perspective and, in the fourth quarter of this year, will likely be the lowest contribution for 2014 as well as compared to last year. So it's really just the timing of where those projects fall. And as we talked about earlier in the year, we saw a number of the mainline projects looking like that they were going to push into '15 and it's impacted what we see from the quarter-over-quarter comparison.","James F. O'Neil","Yes. And I wouldn't read anything into that, Adam. I mean, we always talk about quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in our business. And when you look at the fourth quarter and you look at our pipeline business, I would not read anything into it being a flat or slightly down from a prior period. I think you need to look at the opportunities that we have on a longer-term basis, and there's certainly opportunities out there to grow that business as we move into '15.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Mannes with Avondale Partners.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on mainline. You've locked in, I guess, these long-term arrangements and your tone on '15 is pretty upbeat. But can you talk a little bit maybe about any timing concerns you may have on '15, given a couple of the large projects slated for '15 are still subject to some permitting issues? Or is that something that could impact you? Or is the projects that you're tagging pretty firm at this point?","James F. O'Neil","Oh, no, that's always a concern, I mean, for us and our customers, that projects can get pushed. I mean, I think we're pretty comfortable that many of these projects all have moved far enough along in that process to where we're going to have a nice uptick in mainline pipe activity next year. I mean, I think the risk is a lot less than what obviously was a year ago because many of these projects have been moving forward with the permitting and signing process. So we're pretty comfortable where we stand today. But that doesn't mean something can't happen to push these projects to the right. But at this point in time, we're pretty comfortable that we're going to move -- that these projects will be moved into construction next year.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then real quick, just a follow-up on the Fiber business. Obviously, you're in a bit of a transition as you're offering more lit services. It's just kind of hard to tell from the outside because it looks like numbers have been pretty flattish year-over-year or even down a little bit in, spite of the investment. Can you maybe peel back the onion and tell us a little bit more what's going on, on the core side relative to the ancillary? Because it's kind of hard to see the benefit of some of the CapEx you're putting in the system.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, I understand, Dan. It's a problem I continue to be plagued with. From a -- clearly, the ancillary telecom revenues that are in that segment create those fluctuations. The underlying Fiber business itself, consistent with what we've been seeing in the last few quarters, is still growing at kind of a mid single-digit range. It's just masked by those fluctuations in that ancillary telecom revenue work, which those are down, because as we've talked about in the past, those just aren't strategic revenues for us as we stand here today. We still believe that we'll be able to put it back into a double-digit growth within that sector -- within that segment. Probably at this stage of the game, still yet in 2016. We talked about previously when we rolled into lit fiber, that it would take us about 18 months to see the contribution. We are seeing contribution today. Those revenues are coming online, and I do think that we'll continue to see those revenues increase such that we do think that probably in the latter part of -- in the mid to latter part of '16, we'll be back to double-digit growth within the segment for the Fiber business specifically.","Operator","And next, we'll move on to William Bremer with The Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Given the very strong top line growth of the 2 segments, I'm just trying to put together in my mind, what type of capacity are you currently running at? And then I'm looking at your backlog and I'm saying to myself, how does that equate to like 2015 and beyond? I mean, you guys have done a superb job here. Just trying to get a sense of how you're allocating your resources. And then my next question is given that, how are the labor rates in these fields? And how are they progressing?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean, to answer the second part of your question first, labor rates, most of the work we're doing is under multiyear agreements. When these agreements, these collective-bargaining agreements come up for renewal or renegotiation, we're seeing rates that are fair, increases that are tied really to cost-of-living-type increases. So the labor rates aren't getting out of control. And labor rates also get passed on to our customers when we have increases. Now that doesn't mean we're not seeing some areas that have higher escalation, which is overall, I think when you look at it collectively, there's fair increases across both the electric power and on the oil and gas side of our business. As far as resources, I mean, I think one of the good things we do as an organization is because of our entrepreneurial business model and because we're not the low-price contractor, we do spend a lot of time and effort investing in people and we stay ahead of these growth curves. So we're out there developing the future leaders of the organization, both at the superintendent project management level. And we work very closely with the trades to develop the crafts people needed to meet the needs of a few. We've got a lot of work going on, a lot more than anybody else. A lot of this work requires a lot of -- the development of people requires on-the-job training. So we have that advantage, too, because we all work in 50-million-plus hours a year in the field. We can accelerate development of people to move up through the trade as well to be qualified journeymen linemen or welders or whatever. So I'm not saying it's not challenging, it's a challenging environment. But our company is in probably the best position to develop people and to keep up with the growth opportunities than anybody else in the industry.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Right. And then one for you, Derrick. I noticed you guys tapped the debt market this quarter. Can you give us a little color on that? Was that because of the acquisitions or the receivables? Or can you just give us some color on what that's all about?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes. I mean, as much of it is all the things that you laid out, I mean, working capital and the timing of acquisitions. A big portion also is just the timing of when we received cash versus our ability to pay down the debt. We've been making payments against that debt even since quarter-end. So a lot of it just has to do with just the timing of when those flows were happening.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Min Cho with FBR Capital Markets.","Min Cho - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but if you could just provide any additional details about the opportunities in 1 gigabit along your Power Distribution business. And as well, any additional details on your efforts on the offshore work?","James F. O'Neil","Well, offshore is -- I mean, moving forward, it's pretty active. I mean, it's -- the development of deepwater and the work we're seeing in the shales would actually translate some of -- the company we bought in Houma, Louisiana that has fabrication capabilities, we're actually expanding some of their capabilities on land, opportunities building production systems and midstream facilities for customers. We're also offshore deepwater production systems, mechanical hookups. All of that's increasing. And we've got a niche market. We're in a niche market there that's performing well and we see some nice growth opportunities there. On the distribution side, we're seeing, for Google, a lot of opportunities on their fiber rollout, where we can do the power make-ready. Much of this infrastructure is being put on utility poles, utility infrastructure that has energized conductor. It requires a qualified journeyman lineman to do the power makeready for the telecom contractors. And certainly, that's a big opportunity for us moving forward. Also, part of the growth on distribution is the continued replacement of the aging grid in many areas, storm hardening, and the opportunity to upgrade the grid infrastructure to accept some of the technology that's being rolled out as far as the smart meter technologies or integrate distributed generation on to the grid. So you've got various initiatives occurring across the United States and Canada. And our Distribution business is going to continue to have a growth feel to it. I mean, we've probably grown that business to double-digit rates the last 4 years and I don't see that business slowing down anytime soon. So we see positive momentum right now in all subsectors of our -- of each of the segments as we see it today.","Min Cho - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then also given the strong demand that you're seeing across all of your end markets, are you starting to see the pricing -- any change in pricing? Or is the -- are the margins in backlog still pretty close to what you're reporting right now?","James F. O'Neil","Yes. The margins in backlog are comparable to what we're executing on today. I mean, when we have an opportunity to increase pricing, we do. But many of the relationships we have today are with strategic customers who have sophisticated procurement groups, and we're making acceptable margins there today. And we're getting more scale, and we're helping our customers over time reduce costs and taking over more functionality from them. And certainly, over time, as we take on more responsibility, there may be an opportunity to improve margins. But right now, with the strategic relationships we're in, we're making good margins. And certainly, the scale is the important thing today in this environment, is to continue to maintain that relationship and grow with our customers as our CapEx programs become significantly larger than what they've been historically over the next several years.","Operator","And next, we'll move on to John Rogers with D.A. Davidson & Co.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Jim, first thing is, in terms of the Oil and Gas business that you've got, especially looking out into 2015, and I understand your comments, you haven't seen any real change in planning, but how much of the business, in your mind, is tied to oil projects versus gas?","James F. O'Neil","Well, most of our work in the Marcellus is, as we stated in our prepared remarks, were gas. I mean, that's where most of our work is occurring. And I would say that when we moved into mainline, it's by mix. It's a mix. I wouldn't say that oil is predominant or gas is predominant. We're just seeing a mix of opportunities to move product on mainline pipes. So it's -- you really just can't put your finger on it. I would just say where we are predominant on a fossil fuel, it would be on our gathering work in the Marcellus is where we do probably 80% of our gathering. And that's predominantly natural gas and natural gas liquids.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And the mainline agreements that you have?","James F. O'Neil","It's a mix. It's both moving liquids and gas.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Got it. And then my second question, I guess, is maybe for Derrick, Spending on acquisitions, I haven't seen the Q yet, but where are you year-to-date? And sort of what are you expecting into 2015, given your pipeline?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes. From a year-to-date perspective, total acquisitions, when you say spending, I don't know if you're asking from a revenue or total consideration. I'd say from a consideration perspective, we're probably in around the $250 million, $275 million range of total spend. Then from a run rate perspective, we're probably in the near or probably a little above our $400 million run rate revenue perspective. I won't comment specifically anything between now and the end of the year, but I'll just simply say that our acquisition program continues at a pace that's fairly comparable to what you saw in '13 and what you're seeing on a year-to-date basis such that I would say on the forward 12 months, you can still yet see revenue contributions may be in order of magnitude of the $500 million range, consistent what you've seen in the trailing 12-month basis.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Shlisky with Global Hunter.","Michael Shlisky - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","I want to ask you quickly about the new Nalcor project. Given the size of the project and some of it is in a fairly, I'd say, out-of-the-way location, is there any change or any difference in this project with the start-up costs or the cadence of the cost of the contract versus other smaller contracts?","James F. O'Neil","No. I mean, every project's different, and obviously, this is a project that's in a very remote area. So we've got things we need to do to prepare to get our people and equipment in there. But all of those costs are covered on the contract and they're in the total contract price. So it doesn't matter how complicated or intense a mobe or demobe is, it's all priced into the contract under the same margin profile that we expect to give for our shareholders.","Michael Shlisky - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. Great. Another Maine question, just on your company's storm-related work. It's been a pretty light hurricane season, not a lot of Maine storms. But that said, none of the big storms actually makes the national papers. I'm just kind of wondering if any large storm projects appear in the third quarter and whether there was an increase or decrease over the prior year.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes. This is Derrick. I mean, we probably did roughly $30 million of storm work this quarter, which is very close to what we had originally forecasted. And kind of year-over-year, I'd say that's up about $10 million as compared to last year. Right now, we're anticipating only about $100 million for the year, and we're right on course for that for this year.","Operator","And next, we'll move on to Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.","Brian K. Lee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, to start, I might have misunderstood or misheard you. But Jim, can you clarify the comments around free cash flow for 2015? I thought you had said free cash flow should look similar to 2013 levels. But given there should be much higher revenue and some margin expansion across the segments, just wondering why there wouldn't be a much better profile heading into next year.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, this is Derrick. I mean, we have yet to give financial guidance for 2015, which is what makes getting into the specifics of the cash flow even more difficult. We historically don't forecast our cash flow. But my comments are really more along the lines of that when I think about 2013's overall contribution, that I think that 2015 could be similar just from a dollar perspective. But cash flow is very difficult for us to forecast as it relates to the timing of projects, the working capital demands, CapEx, acquisitions and then the like. But I continue to believe that with the expansion of margins and the volume, that we would continue to see an expansion in cash flow in 2015 over 2014. So I do agree with your comment.","Brian K. Lee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then maybe just to follow up on that margin commentary. Was also wondering, I know you alluded to it on prior questions, but how are you thinking about the 9% to 12% operating margin target, particularly for the oil and gas segment? Reason I ask is, I would have expected a bit more expansion in this quarter, specifically given the big sequential increase in revenues. So maybe any color around the dynamics there would be helpful.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes. I mean, from a segment perspective, we ended up at 10% margins within that segment, which is moving very firmly into our 9% to 12% guidance. And so we continue to be pleased with the margin expansion we see. I think that we've seen that as the mainline continues to contribute, we -- each period, we continue to see margin expansion. That's what gives us the confidence to think that when we get into 2015, that the 9% to 12% is something that's very achievable. I think one of the differences as well is that when we think about 9% to 12% for 2015, I think the level of mainline contribution is such that we feel like we may be able to be there from a year perspective rather than just an individual quarter perspective. The -- part of that is the expansion of revenue, which is going to have a better fixed cost absorption and then as well as just the execution on projects. So we continue to feel confident being able to get into that space of that 9% to 12% as we go forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jon Braatz with Kansas City Capital.","Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates","Jim, I have a question on the Sunrise project. Obviously, the charge was rather consequential this quarter. When you look ahead, what have you learned? What are some of the things that you might have put in place? New systems, new controls that we don't see a recurrence of that. And most specifically, do you take verbal assurances on change orders at this time or still?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I'll tell you that, obviously, there's always lessons learned when you go through something like this. We don't like being in this situation. I can't recall in the history of the company that we've had a dispute at this level. And certainly, there's best practices that come out of it. I mean, a lot of times, when you're out there in the field and you're in the middle of trying to get something built under an extreme time line, I mean, this used to be more of a handshake business and things are changing. I think the environment's changed over the last 5 years since the recession. And certainly, we've done a lot to put new processes and procedures and controls in place from the development and training of our people and increasing and improving our project management capabilities. And documentation certainly is a big component of that, to ensure we paper up any changes that occur -- change in scope that can occur in the field. So yes, I mean, there are lessons learned here, and certainly, you can look back on any situation. With that said, we're still pursuing the total amount of decline and this was a change in legal strategy as we move toward -- moving from what we call a settlement to more of an arbitration environment. So yes, they're best practices, and certainly, we've implemented those throughout the organization.","Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates","Do you think we'll see a final resolution in 2015?","James F. O'Neil","Arbitration is supposed to occur in the second quarter of 2015, so we're hopeful that will bring finality to this, yes.","Operator","And we've now reached the allotted time for this conference call. At this point, I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","James F. O'Neil","Yes.

Jim?","James F. O'Neil","Thank you, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with an operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our first quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","Revenues increased approximately 11% in the first quarter as compared to last year's first quarter, which reflect solid demand for our services, safe project execution and Quanta's leadership position in the energy infrastructure marketplace. Our operations performed well in what is typically our most seasonally challenged quarter. Excluding the effects of the unusual charge taken in the first quarter, profitability grew and margins expanded as compared to the same quarter last year.","Total backlog increased to a record $9 billion at quarter end, up nearly 29% year-over-year. Our employee count at the end of the first quarter increased 9.4% from year-end 2013 to a record 22,846. Man hours in the first quarter increased 16.1% over the same period last year.","For the second quarter, we anticipate a late breakup or seasonal thaw in Canada and in northern parts of the United States. The extreme cold temperatures and the duration of the frigid weather in the first quarter in the northern climes has created [indiscernible], in some areas, up to 8 feet. We currently have significant electric transmission and pipeline work underway in these affected areas and anticipate some negative impact to production as the breakup occurs.","As we have stated previously, quarter-over-quarter dynamics, including the timing of project awards and starts as well as weather, can create variances in the short term. However, I want to communicate that we remain comfortable with our full year 2014 guidance, adjusting for the unusual charge recorded in the first quarter of this year.","Derrick will provide more detail about our second quarter and full year guidance in his commentary.","As it relates to our full year expectations, we have strong visibility into significant work that could drive backlog to new record levels throughout the year. We anticipate large project awards for both our Electric Power and Oil and Gas Infrastructure segments in the coming months, some of which, we believe, will begin construction this year.","We continue to see the size, scope and complexity of projects increase at unprecedented levels. Quanta anticipates this changing market -- anticipated this change in market dynamics and positioned the company throughout the last several years to capitalize on these strengths. We focused on developing our people, project management capabilities, equipment and technology advancements and also expanded the breadth of our services, all while remaining -- maintaining a strong balance sheet.","Our customers seek reliable end-to-end solutions and clearly see the value proposition that Quanta delivers, which we believe is unmatched in the industry. As a result, we estimate that our win rate on customer infrastructure programs that involve large, complex and\/or multiyear solutions is increasing. In this environment, we believe Quanta is the contractor of choice.","For example, FirstEnergy, which is one of the nation's largest utilities, selected Quanta as its preferred supplier of transmission and substation construction services for its $4.2 billion 4-year Energizing the Future capital program. This program is designed to support system reliability as coal-fired power plants are retired; increase FirstEnergy's low-serving capability in areas where future economic growth is anticipated, particularly in Ohio's shale gas regions; improve reliability of service; create more flexibility to restore service following storms; reduce line losses; and lower overall transmission maintenance cost. This is a large, complex multi-year program, where Quanta can provide a solution to safely complete First Energy's program on time and on budget.","Turning to electric distribution. Due to spending reductions during the last recession and the significant allocation of capital to transmission, utility distribution investment has been inadequate. Major weather events over the past few years have highlighted system integrity and reliability challenges. As a result, we are seeing significant reinvestment in distribution assets across North America. The utilities are implementing system-hardening initiatives to better resist severe storm events, and utility regulators are increasingly showing a willingness to allow favorable rate treatment for those distribution upgrades.","In addition, utilities are enhancing distribution networks as distributed generation, demand response and other technologies are deployed. New-home construction strength in some markets is driving distribution activity as well.","We continue to add distribution crews to our customers' distribution systems because of these dynamics. Over the past year, Quanta has experienced a strong double-digit increase in distribution MSA backlog. We see opportunity for double-digit distribution revenue growth for the next several years as a result.","We continue to believe the market for our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services remain dynamic for at least the next couple of years. The unconventional shale plays in the Canadian oil sands are reshaping the North American energy market and could require hundreds of billions of dollars in spending over the next several decades on new infrastructure required to gather and move hydrocarbons to markets throughout North America.","ICF International, a consulting and professional services firm with expertise in energy infrastructure, recently updated their 2011 report regarding expected North American midstream infrastructure investment. From a high level, the updated report predicts greater levels of North American hydrocarbon production than their 2000 report -- 2011 report, and greater levels of midstream infrastructure investment to meet supply needs.","And looking at the 2014 versus the 2011 report, on a comparable basis, North American midstream investment is now expected to total over $311 billion, and average annual North American midstream investment is anticipated to be $14.1 billion per year from 2014 through 2035, which is a 34% increase versus the 2011 study.","Similar to Electric Power, we believe Quanta is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these oil and gas infrastructure opportunities. As a leading pipeline construction company with extensive engineering, program management, manpower and equipment capabilities, we have the scope and scale across North America. Coupled with our reputation, track record and customer relationships, we are well positioned to be an important participant during this historic time in the North American oil and gas markets.","Now let's transition to our Fiber Optic Licensing segment. Our lit service rollout is underway in northeast markets, and we are meeting deployment objectives. We recently completed the deployment of our mesh network, which enables us to provide additional lit services and reach more customers in our target markets. As previously discussed, 2014 is a transition year for this segment as we deploy our lit services offering. Our lit services expansion has been well received by both existing and potential customers.","We expect robust growth in lit service revenues over the coming years across the enterprise verticals. However, our dark fiber services remains this segment's largest revenue contributor. Demand for our dark fiber services remains strong in the K-12 and carrier markets. We will continue to expand our dark fiber network over time, which will -- which we believe will fuel demand for our lit services.","In summary, while unusual items impacted first quarter results, end-market drivers remain firmly in place. Demand for our specialty infrastructure services is strong. We have visibility into significant new project awards this year that could drive higher levels of backlog, and our multi-year outlook remains positive. We are expanding and developing our employee base and broadening our service offerings to meet our customers' growing needs, and we are executing on strategies that differentiate Quanta and position the company for both the near- and long-term growth.","We continue to believe that we are in unprecedented times, not only in Quanta's history, but in the history of the electric power and oil and gas industries. As a result, we continue to see the opportunity for double-digit growth over at least the next 2 years.","I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his financial review of the first quarter. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.76 billion for the first quarter of 2014 compared to $1.59 billion in the prior year's first quarter, reflecting an increase of 11% in quarter-over-quarter revenue.","Net income attributable to common stock for the quarter was $54.4 million or $0.25 per diluted share as compared to $72.1 million or $0.34 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year. Included in net income attributable to common stock for the first quarter of 2014 is an aggregate $38.8 million, or $25.8 million net of tax, incremental selling, general and administrative expense associated with an adverse arbitration decision regarding a contract dispute with National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago on a directional drilling project that occurred in 2010.","The net impact of this decision on our first quarter 2014 results was a $0.12 reduction in diluted earnings per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes this and certain other items, as calculated in today's press release, was $0.44 for the first quarter of 2014 as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.38 for the first quarter of 2013.","The increase in consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2014 was primarily due to an 8% increase in revenues from our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment and a 24% increase in revenues from our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment. Our consolidated gross margin was 15.4% in the first quarter of 2014 as compared to 15% in the first quarter of 2013. This increase in gross margin was primarily a result of improved performance in the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment, as well as higher revenues earned from both the Electric Power and Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segments during the current period, which improved these segments' ability to cover fixed operating costs.","Selling, general and administrative expenses, as presented in this quarter's press release, were $134.5 million in the first quarter of 2014, reflecting an increase of $20.8 million as compared to last year's first quarter. This increase is primarily attributable to $13.6 million in incremental general and administrative costs and $3.9 million in higher acquisition and integration costs, all associated with companies acquired since the first quarter of 2013.","As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 7.6% in the first quarter of 2014 from 7.2% in the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to the impact of the higher acquisition and integration costs.","Our consolidated operating margin, before amortization expense, of 5.6% for 1Q '14, was impacted by 220 basis points due to the arbitration expense, but was otherwise comparable to the 7.9% margin in 1Q '13. Amortization of intangible assets increased from $5.3 million in 1Q '13 to $8.2 million in the first quarter of 2014 due to amortization of additional intangible assets associated with acquisitions that have closed since the first quarter of last year.","To further discuss our segment results, the Electric Power segment's revenues were $1.28 billion, reflecting an increase of $97.2 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 8%. Revenues were positively impacted by approximately $69 million in revenues generated by acquired companies and from increased capital spending by our customers, partially offset by a lower quarter-over-quarter conversion rate of the Canadian results of operations.","As Jim mentioned, the first quarter was impacted by frigid weather throughout much of North America. This compares to the first quarter of last year, which had mild weather and favorable working conditions that better accommodated production and allowed for certain work to be accelerated out of last year's second quarter into the first.","Despite the weather effects of this year's first quarter, we continued to execute and operating margin in the Electric Power segment increased to 11.3% in the first quarter of 2014 as compared to 11.2% in last year's first quarter. 12-month and total backlog increased both quarter-over-quarter and sequentially for the Electric Power segment. Sequentially, 12-month backlog increased slightly from the end of the fourth quarter of 2013. However, total backlog increased 3.7% to a record $6.19 billion.","Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by 24% to $445.9 million in 1Q '14, as a result of revenue contributions of approximately $118.9 million from companies acquired since the first quarter of 2013. This favorable impact was partially offset by lower revenues related to midstream projects during the first quarter of 2014 as compared to first quarter of 2013 due to project timing, as well as the same weather dynamics discussed relative to the Electric Power segment.","Operating income for the Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment, as a percentage of revenues, decreased to negative 4.7% in 1Q '14 from 2.9% in 1Q '13. This decrease was due to the arbitration expense mentioned previously, which impacted the segment by 870 basis points. Partially offsetting this expense were higher margins due to the contribution of greater mainline pipe revenues during the quarter, which typically offer higher margin opportunities.","Also impacting the first quarter was additional expense resulting from an increase in our estimated withdrawal liability associated with the Central States Pension Plan based on certain withdrawal scenarios that increased our estimated range of probable liability.","Although we continue to believe that we effected a complete withdrawal in 2012 and will seek to challenge and further negotiate the amount owed in connection with this matter, based upon available information, we recorded an adjustment to cost of services during the 3 months ended March 31, 2014 to increase the recognized withdrawal liability to amount within the revised range of estimated probability.","The negative impact to operating income within the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment associated with the increase in the Central States withdrawal liability was offset this quarter by the favorable settlement of certain contract change orders during the period.","Total backlog for the Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment at the end of the first quarter of 2014 is up 2.8% as compared to 4Q '13. Contributing to the increase in backlog is approximately $200 million from acquisitions closed during the quarter. Offsetting this increase is the burn on current projects, which were not replaced with new project awards during the quarter. However, as Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks, we see the potential for significant project award announcements later in the year.","Our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment revenues were down $7.2 million or 16% to $38.5 million in 1Q '14 as compared to $45.8 million in 1Q '13, due to lower levels of ancillary telecommunication service revenues, as certain larger projects completed in the prior year did not recur to the same extent in 2014. Operating margin was 31.4% in 1Q '14 as compared to 36.9% in 1Q '13, as a result of the telecom work performed in 2014 having a lower margin profile than last year, as well as a slightly higher network maintenance cost during the current period on our dark fiber network and start-up costs associated with our new lit service offerings.","Corporate and unallocated costs increased $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2014 as compared to 1Q '13, primarily as a result of $3.9 million in higher acquisition and integration costs, $2.7 million in higher consulting and other business development fees, and a $2.9 million increase in amortization expense related to 2014 and 2013 acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation quarter-over-quarter associated with current levels of operating activity and profitability.","EBITA for the first quarter of 2014 was $95.1 million or 5.4% of revenues compared to $119.3 million or 7.5% of revenues for the first quarter of 2013. Adjusted EBITDA was $185.6 million or 10.5% of revenues for the first quarter of 2014 compared to $159.8 million or 10.1% of revenues for the first quarter of 2013.","The calculation of EBITA, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, all non-GAAP measures, and the definitions of these and days sales outstanding, or DSOs, can be found in the Investors & Media section of our website at quantaservices.com.","For the first quarter of 2014, cash flow used in operations was approximately $61 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $69 million, resulting in approximately $130 million of negative free cash flow as compared to negative free cash flow of approximately $12 million for the first quarter of 2013. The decline in free cash flow was primarily driven by higher working capital requirements during the first quarter, as ramp-up occurred on specific electric power transmission projects, and weather-related delays in parts of North America and the timing of project closeouts affected achievement of certain billing milestones.","These increased working capital needs also negatively impacted our DSOs, which were 80 days at March 31, 2014 compared to 72 days at December 31, 2013 and 77 days at March 31, 2013, adjusted for the reclass of the Sunrise change order.","Other impacts -- other items that impacted investment [ph] cash flows during the first quarter of 2014 include the closing of 5 acquisitions for aggregate consideration of $116.5 million, including the use of approximately $79.9 million in cash. As it relates to the arbitration expense recorded in the first quarter, we currently anticipate the second quarter cash settlement of this obligation, net of tax benefits, to be approximately $15.4 million.","At March 31, 2014, we had about $213 million in letters of credit outstanding, primarily to secure our insurance program, and we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $273 million in cash, with approximately $134 million in U.S. funds and $139 million relating to our foreign operations. Considering our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we have nearly $1.38 billion in total liquidity as of March 31, 2014.","Concerning our outlook for 2014, we expect revenues for the second quarter of 2014 to range between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, and diluted earnings per share to be $0.35 to $0.37 on a GAAP basis. These estimates compare to revenues of $1.47 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.33 in the second quarter of 2013. Our GAAP EPS forecast for the second quarter of 2014 includes an estimate of $8.3 million for noncash, stock-based compensation expense and $8.4 million for amortization expense. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2014 is expected to be $0.40 to $0.42 and compares to our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.38 in the second quarter of 2013.","As Jim briefly mentioned in his commentary, we currently anticipate the weather aspects of the first quarter to carry over and impact our performance in the second quarter, primarily in Canada and the northern regions of the U.S., as we deal with breakup and very wet conditions as these areas thaw. In addition, the timing of projects, including the transition of resources, can impact margins. We have factored these effects into our overall guidance for the second quarter, but have not narrowed our overall diluted earnings per share range for the year, as we continue to believe that the latter half of the year offers the opportunity for strong performance.","We continue to expect revenues for the full year 2014 to range between $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion. We expect diluted earnings per share to be between $1.53 and $1.73 on a GAAP basis, giving effect to the $0.12 per share impact of the previously mentioned arbitration decision on our annual estimates.","Our GAAP EPS forecast for 2014 includes an estimate of $35.5 million for noncash, stock-based compensation expense and $33.3 million of amortization expense. Excluding these expenses, the arbitration expense and others, comparable to our historical calculations, our expectations for non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year of 2014 remain between $1.85 and $2.05. This compares to $1.71 in 2013.","Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share presented in our release. We are currently forecasting net income attributable to non-controlling interests to be approximately $3 million to $4 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $13 million to $14 million for the year.","For additional guidance, we are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate to be 34.5% to 35.5% for 2014 and our diluted share count to be about 219.8 million shares. We expect CapEx for all of 2014 to be approximately $300 million to $325 million, which includes CapEx for our Fiber Licensing and Other segment of about $50 million to $60 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2013 of $264 million.","Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth, and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and repurchases of stock.","This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Noelle Dilts of Stifel.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I first want to -- just to go back to these potential large contract awards that you talked about potentially coming through in the next few months. First, in terms of mix, are you seeing more of that on the pipeline side or the transition side? And can you talk about if you're seeing more of the opportunities in Canada or the U.S.? And then, in conjunction with that, last quarter, you talked about needing to pick up some additional work to hit your pipeline targets. Does what you're looking at here get you comfortably there?","James F. O'Neil","Noelle, this is Jim. I think it's a good mix of both, both segments. So it's probably 60-40, 50-50. It depends upon how it plays out, but it -- but we expect large opportunities in both our Electric Power and Oil and Gas segments and also believe, geographically, it will come from 60-40, 50-50 U.S. and Canada. So it's a good diversity of geographic and across both of our segments.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then, just given the strong pipeline outlook that you relayed in your comments, can you talk about if you're starting to see some improvement in terms, conditions, pricing? Are you seeing a shift toward more negotiated work?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, there's a mix. But certainly, we are having more advanced discussions with customers that take us away from our traditional bid-and-buy mentality and moving more towards negotiated-type, multi-year programs that we talked about in my remarks, more complex, larger, multi-year programs where there's more shared risk. So, yes, the contract terms would be improving in those situations.","Operator","The next question comes from Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First question is just to follow up on the earlier question on the large awards. You mentioned in your press release you do expect some notable additions to backlog over the next couple of months and that's a fairly strong statement given you folks are pretty conservative. So any color you can provide on what gives you the confidence on the visibility there would be helpful.","James F. O'Neil","Well, Tahira, I just -- we're in various stages of negotiation, which gives us the comfort that we can make those types of comments in our press release and in the script. So they are advanced discussions, many of them in the contract stage. And we're having discussions with these customers exclusively. So that brings us the confidence that these programs will turn into backlog sometime in the near future.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And second question is in regards to the second quarter guidance. As you look back to when you set guidance, did you kind of expect the weather issue and the sequential decline from first to second quarter to be of the extent, potentially, that we are seeing? And then, if you could give us any color, if possible, on the acquisition, how much they have potentially contributed to backlog for the quarter and in terms of whether you think they're notably accretive for the full year.","Derrick A. Jensen","Tahira, this is Derrick. Relative to the second quarter, I think, if you recall from our previous conference call, in the year-end discussion, we had talked about the fact that we had to see how the weather effects would come out and looked at how those things would impact our overall production for the first half of the year when considering what we would be looking at for our margin profile overall, as well as our view towards the second half of the year. So, yes, there was definitely a degree of that factored into our original guidance as to what would happen here in the second quarter. The breakup went a little bit longer, so there's a degree of probably a little bit lower view into that second quarter than maybe we had at year end. But we still think that, as we look at the rest of the year, we'll be able to make that up in the strong performance for the third and the fourth. As it relates to the acquisitions, the acquisitions were slightly accretive to the first quarter. However, they were baked into our original first quarter guidance so there's really no difference. They were contemplated in our forecast. And overall to the year, all acquisitions, we look for them to be some level of accretive, and we do believe those acquisitions are contributing to the year at some degree.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Mannes of Avondale.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","So not to belabor the point, but I just want to make sure we're really clear here. Given the guidance for the year, given a solid first quarter and maybe a slightly softer-than-expected second quarter, when you look at the bidding environment and the number of things you're talking about in terms of potential large wins, how much is that needed in order to meet guidance versus how much would give you potential upside as you look in the back of the year, especially in the context of a pretty strong track record the last couple of years of coming in ahead of initial guidance?","Derrick A. Jensen","Dan, this is Derrick. Relative to the high end of our range, I mean, there's a degree of uncommitted that is in the high end of our range, kind of, specifically on mainline pipe. But there's always uncommitted across the whole spectrum. So there's additional awards that we'd look at that will be needed for us to get to the high end of the range. As to speak to how much is that and\/or how much more could happen and whether that would allow us to exceed, there are a lot of dynamics associated with those awards. We need to look at getting them and then getting them in place and seeing at what point in time we can get to an execution stage in 2014 before we could really comment as to whether it causes us to increase our guidance or not.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then, just to -- just so I can clarify, as it relates to M&A, it sounded like most of the M&A impact from the first quarter was on the -- was on the oil and gas side. I guess, I was trying to understand -- I thought the number of acquisitions in the first quarter were going to be more electric. Was that already baked in the guidance, or is that -- has that helped fill in some of that uncommitted as well?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, all of our acquisitions in the first quarter were baked into our year-end guidance from our last conference call. The difference, as it relates to the impact, is that a big portion of the electric power acquisitions were subcontract work. And so therefore, there's a much less impact on the backlog component. So that's why you see a larger impact on backlog on the pipeline side.","Operator","The next question comes from Jamie Cook of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. Just to clarify on the weather, I know it was an issue in the first quarter to roll into the second quarter. Can you give us some degree on the EPS impact or the operating income impact just so I can get a sense for how much you have to make up for the weather issues? And then, I guess, my second question is margins on the oil and gas side. The first quarter was a little weaker than I would have thought, but it sounds like, given the order activity, that you should improve throughout the year. So how are you thinking about that? And then, my last question, should we assume better terms or pricing on these contracts that you're bidding on, in particular because you're saying you're bidding on these exclusively?","Derrick A. Jensen","Jamie, this is Derrick. Relative to the first quarter, coming from a weather perspective, what I'd say is we came in at the -- near the top end of our -- or at the top end of our revenue range. But we kind of came in at the midpoint of our EPS range. So I think that kind of gives you a little bit of color. The reality is the first quarter itself, we were able to actually keep some degree of execution because of the fact that it was cold and stayed frozen. And so, we were able to get a degree of execution in the quarter. Your second question was?","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My second question was just on the oil and gas side. The margins in the first quarter were a little weaker than I would have thought. But do you think you should get some improvement on -- particularly with orders -- order trends that you [indiscernible] how should we think about that? And then, the last was the terms and conditions on the projects that you're bidding exclusively. I would assume that they would be accretive to margins or mix.","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure. On the margins itself, seasonality within the pipeline group is going to remain. And so, we would always expect the first quarter seasonality impacts to be such that margins within that segment will still be -- we would anticipate the lowest margins for the period. We improved our margins this quarter versus last quarter. I mean, if you adjust for the charge, I think you'll see something in the order of magnitude of kind of a 4% margin within the segment, which is greater than the 2.8% we made last year. So we did see improvement. We expected to see some degree of improvement. As we look to the rest of the year, I think we can continue to see improvement similar to what you saw last year, with each of the following quarters having a degree of upward movement. And I would anticipate that that's the type of seasonality you'll see on a go-forward basis.","James F. O'Neil","And, Jamie, on your third question, I would say, yes, overall, you will see better contract terms than we have historically had on these larger, more complex, multi-year programs that are going to come out here in the coming months.","Operator","The next question comes from Will Gabrielski of Stephens.","Will Gabrielski - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So I guess -- I mean, I know there's a lot of noise in Q1, but the electric margin was up a little bit year-over-year. And for a Q1 that definitely had a lot of weather across the Lower 48 and Canada, seems pretty solid. And I'm just wondering, was there anything unique to the quarter? Or do you think we still grow off of Q1 just as weather improves? Or is there something new that's impacting Q1 that made that number better than we've seen in past years in Q1s?","Derrick A. Jensen","There was nothing that was particularly unusual to the Electric Power margins in Q1 from the standpoint of an unusual item. I mean, that came in 11.3%, which, as I commented just a second ago, to a certain extent, the long winter and the prolonged freeze helped production in a lot of the northern climates, and it's -- and so, what's happened is that some of that's otherwise pushed to second quarter. As the breakup and thaw occurs, that will impact us on the productivity more in the second.","James F. O'Neil","I would say that in the electric segment, to answer your other question, we continue to see man hours increase in that segment. There's an opportunity certainly with my comments about backlog growth. Certainly, I think that there are clear opportunities for us to grow revenues in this segment from this point.","Will Gabrielski - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, to follow up, Jim, on the FirstEnergy comment you made around an alliance relationship or preferred supplier relationship with FirstEnergy, particularly in Ohio, I guess, are there more of those conversations taking place? Because I remember, I guess, '07, '08, '09, it seemed like you announced a few of those big alliance-type relationships. Are you seeing that more of a norm now? Is this very one-off? Or is there any color you can add around that type of relationship structure going forward?","James F. O'Neil","Well, certainly, we've always had those discussions in the past with customers. But the opportunities are more today than they have been in the past because these programs are becoming so large and complex. And the scope and scale and expertise and your track record is extremely important. So we are seeing more opportunities for FirstEnergy-type relationships than what we have seen in the past, going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Rygiel of FBR Capital Markets.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Quick question. You mentioned that distribution double-digit backlog growth, double-digit revenue outlook for the next couple of years. Can you comment on where the electric distribution margins are relative to reported Electric Power today and sort of what that incremental margin might look like over the next couple of years as revenues grow nicely?","James F. O'Neil","Alex, I think that, as we leverage our fixed costs in that business and as the labor workforce continues to tighten and as we continue to take over more of the service offerings, not just provide maintenance services but more asset management and distribution, which there's clear opportunities to do that for many of our distribution customers, that your margin profile will approach that of what we make in transmission over time. So one of the big misnomers is that when we do more distribution, that our margins will erode because it's not as profitable as transmission. That's just not the case. We think that margins will improve as distribution continues to unfold over the next several years.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And secondly, can you quantify your activity level on mainline pipe in sort of the first half of '14 versus the second half of '14? I don't know exactly how you want to quantify it, but maybe talk about quantity of spreads deployed maybe in the first of the year versus the second half of the year.","James F. O'Neil","Well, we've been saying for quite some time that we believe that activity in mainline is going to accelerate in the second half of this year and certainly into '15. And we believe that one of the big opportunities for us to increase revenues will be in that segment and in mainline in the second half of the year. So as far as trying to equate how many spreads we're going to have out or how many jobs or what that looks like from a revenue standpoint, I would say that it is a -- I would just say it's a significant increase in the second half of the year than what we've executed on in the first half of the year, which is typically seasonal for that type of business. I mean, the business typically starts ramping in the second half -- in the second quarter of any given year, and third quarter is where you really get a lot of good production because that's when you have your better weather during any calendar year.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to make sure the late breakup issue is not going to be a bigger problem than kind of what you're thinking at the moment. So can you maybe just give a little more color on how many projects are affected, what stages you are on those projects and really how, I guess, you've approached the budgeting for that and how comfortable you are that you've got the cost budgeted accurately?","James F. O'Neil","Well, Steve, in the past, we've said we've taken a prudent approach on guidance and we tried to bake in any impacts to the breakup, so that we don't have any surprises. I mean, we have a significant amount of activity going on in Canada. We're probably on 4 or 5 major projects in various phases. Also, we're very active in the Northeast U.S. So it's -- and projects are in various phases. Some will be completed throughout the year, some are multi-year projects. So -- but I would just say that the message from us is that we've tried to bake in any effects of breakup production issues in the guidance that we provided to you.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And it sounds like you're looking for a pickup in the second half to offset the breakup issues to get to the guidance. So I guess, what are the most important things that still have to happen in the second half? Is it more execution, or is it more new bookings? And if it's new bookings, are you counting on some of the bigger projects, or is it the pace of regional work?","Derrick A. Jensen","Steve, this is Derrick. The reality is, I think, that we typically expect the second half of the year to be a more productive period for us. Our -- from a seasonality perspective, the third quarter tends to be the largest revenue period. We still anticipate that as of today. Typically, the fourth quarter falls off a little, which we still anticipate today. But I think the combination of those things, from a total volume perspective, will well exceed what we see here in the first and second quarter. And as part of that and it's typical that, that leads to our ability to have higher margins, both because of the volume, as well as the fact that those weather dynamics allow us to typically have an expanded margin profile. So I think we'll still be very much within the margin profile that we've talked about. We -- in the last quarter, we talked about Electric Power being able to be in that 10% to 12% margin range, and we still believe that, as well as on the pipeline side, that on the upper end of the range, we'll be able to see margins at -- to get within that 9%. So that, I think, is still very similar to our guidance that we provided previously. So we're comfortable that those -- that profile can still exist in the second half of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Derrick, can you talk about the free cash flow outlook for the year? I know you had a positive free cash flow for the first quarter. But as you sort of think about some of these projects, big projects, I mean, how should we think about the free cash flow? And also, where do you think any potential opportunity lies on the M&A front? Is it oil and gas, is it Canada? Can you talk about some of the outlook there?","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure. We typically stay away from providing free cash flow guidance. I can tell you that, I think, it's got the opportunity to be comparable to 2013, but it's highly dependent upon the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of last year, we had a very strong free cash flow because of the timing of roll-offs, starts and stops of projects, et cetera. But the weather dynamics, the -- any of the individual acquisitions, project starts and stops, a lot of the work that -- opportunities that Jim has spoken about for new awards and the timing of those can impact. So I caveat it heavily, but I think you can see it's possible for it to be comparable with 2013. We -- from an acquisition perspective, we still consider ourselves to be highly acquisitive. We've done a number of acquisitions up to the end of '13 and even in the first part of this year thus far. I think that, overall, for '14, we could see acquisition dynamics, while somewhat comparable to 2013, both from a contribution of revenue and total number of acquisitions and spend as far as cash and stock split, is probably somewhat comparable. As to the -- where they'll fall, we continue to be opportunistic, both on whether they're Electric Power side or the pipeline side. I think that you'll see that they're probably going to be within those 2 segments, for certain. But we're going to approach it opportunistically, and I don't know that I could say where you'll see a greater number of acquisitions between the 2.","Operator","The next question comes from Adam Thalhimer of BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","First question. I wanted to ask about the U.S. transmission bidding. It's been a while since we've seen large awards from the public contractors. I'm just curious what the bidding activity is like for larger transmission jobs in the U.S.","James F. O'Neil","Well, we had several awards, I believe, in the second half of last year. So we've had a quarter here where we have had not much activity, but that's not unusual. We do think that there are -- from a dollar standpoint, there's many opportunities out there in the -- that could be announced in the next year that we've never seen before in history. So it's still a very active transmission market in both the U.S. and in Canada. And certainly, we see opportunities for growth in the Electric segment, which is being driven by primarily transmission.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Great. And then I wanted to ask about the programs. Like, with FirstEnergy, you said that was $4.2 billion over 4 years. What percentage of that could turn into revenue for Quanta? I mean, is it in the, maybe, 50% range?","James F. O'Neil","Yes. Rule of thumb -- I mean, you've got engineering materials in that number. It's probably less than that. It's probably in the 35% to 40% range, but it could be as much as 50%, depending upon the customer and how much the material and engineering dynamic is.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Irwin of Wedbush Securities.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Jim, I was hoping you could update us on the number of large electric transmission projects you're executing right now and how these are likely to transition this year, the number completing, the number starting up by the end of the year.","James F. O'Neil","Individual transmission projects, at average, over $100 million in size. We have been consistently running between 16 to 18 projects. We were on the same number of projects in the second quarter of last year as we'll be on the second quarter of this year. And we don't anticipate that number moving in the near term. We think it will hold at that level.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","My second question was about some of the combined cycle opportunities. Obviously, it's a new market for you and pretty attractive long-term market. Can you maybe discuss with us how things are progressing there for Quanta. And maybe the potential project pipeline that you're looking at as far as whether or not you think that there could be incremental bookings in '14 or if this is something where we have to wait for more significant momentum?","James F. O'Neil","You know, Craig, I look at this almost like our utility-scale Solar. We're opportunistic there, and we take advantage of the opportunities when they come. I can't go out to say that we're going to be a 20% growth or double-digit growth year-over-year for the next 2 years in that business because the opportunities are spotty. But when they come, like the one in Alaska that we announced earlier this year, we're certainly excited about the opportunity to build those programs, and -- but I can't tell you whether that business is going to have a steady growth profile to it or not.","Operator","The next question comes from John Rogers of D.A. Davidson.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","First thing, Jim, in terms of large project opportunities you've been referring to, how much of that work that you could book here is '15, '16, potentially? I mean, how much visibility are we potentially getting here?","James F. O'Neil","On most of the electric projects, they would -- many of them would start in '14. And some of them are multi-year bid, multi-year programs. I would say that probably half of the ones that we're looking at are multi-year programs and half are probably -- will take a year to complete.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And on the pipeline?","James F. O'Neil","Pipeline is probably the same, maybe more a multi-year component to them than one-off projects. But there are some projects that are 3 or 4 months that we're looking at potentially being awarded, and there's also some multi-year programs that we're looking at as well.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up, can you give us a quick update on what you're seeing in the offshore market in terms of acquisition opportunities there?","James F. O'Neil","Yes. I wouldn't say so much acquisition opportunities per se. I would say that the market itself is extremely active and continues to provide opportunities. And it is going to grow at or more than what the segment is projected to grow at. So we're pretty excited about that. We're being prudent in our approach there as it is -- relatively, it's an adjacent market. I would say that more of our acquisition opportunities are in our core business. But there are certainly opportunities offshore, and we're going to take advantage of those as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Andy Wittmann of Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I want to just dig a little bit more into the pipeline business and kind of the market dynamic there. It's coming into your income statement a bit. Where is it for the industry? Where's the industry being utilized for large-diameter pipeline stage? And do you have a sense of that and what's the implication for that for your pricing? Are you getting similar or favorable terms in the pipelines like you are in the electric business that you referred to earlier?","James F. O'Neil","Yes. I think, like I mentioned earlier on future work, that we're looking at the ramp at the end of '14 and into '15. We're in the very early stages of this ramp-up. So I think what's been done historically is different than what we're going to see going forward. And the projects going forward, I think, overall, you're going to see better contract terms on those programs.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Does that mean not fixed price or does that just mean guaranteed maximum of...","James F. O'Neil","It's a mix. I mean, you could get better contract terms to where you're sharing downside risk, it could be some cost-plus programs, some are fixed-price with the floors on risk sharing. So it's just a mix of things. But overall, though, there's more risk sharing between the customer and the contractor, especially on the multi-year programs.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And just maybe a couple of quick technical questions. Can you give us the acquired T&D backlog, if any, as well as the storm contribution, Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes. The backlog for T&D from acquisition for the first quarter was relatively minor. It was about $25 million. And then, storm, we did a little over $30 million this quarter, which is comparable to the first quarter last year.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs.","Brian K. Lee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, as a follow-up to that last one, thanks for breaking out the quantification on the backlog impact, Derrick. On the acquisitions, though, how should we think going forward about the organic growth opportunities you guys are looking at to continue to add to what's been robust backlog growth versus acquiring backlog adds? I guess I'm wondering, is it unfair to assume most of the backlog additions in recent quarters have come from acquisitions and if that will continue to be the trend?","Derrick A. Jensen","No, I think that most of Jim's commentary has been about the opportunity for organic backlog growth of -- for the remainder of the year. That's where we think the vast majority of our backlog growth will potentially come from over the next 3 to 6, 9 months. And then, relative -- from an acquisition perspective, the backlog contributions varies. As an example, like I said, the first quarter, we had minimal backlog contributions because some of that stuff was subcontract-related versus the contribution directly from the acquisitions.","Brian K. Lee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe related to that -- and I apologize if you covered this, I jumped on a bit late. I might be misinterpreting this. But if I heard you correctly, I thought you had suggested that there might be a shift here toward more distribution-related power project activity versus transmission going forward. I guess, if that's the case, can you help us understand the competitive environment and maybe the margin delta you expect between the distribution versus transmission and how that would impact your ability to maintain current segment margins and\/or expand them, if that is going to be the trend?","James F. O'Neil","Well, we believe that distribution will grow at the same pace that transmission is growing. It's probably -- I mean, obviously, distribution is a smaller part of the segment, but they should both grow at the same percentages over the next couple of years. The competitive environment, we're on many customer systems. We've been on many customer systems for years. It's -- most of that increase is our existing customer base increasing the number of crews that they have working, our crews that are working, because they just have more work to do. And we have won a couple of new distribution contracts from new customers, which is part of that growth as well. But I see distribution and transmission growing at the same rate, which is double-digit growth opportunities.","Operator","The next question comes from Jon Braatz of Kansas City Capital.","Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates","Jim, question. The -- you talked about the increasing complexity and sophistication of the transmission work that's coming down -- coming ahead. And I guess, my question is -- at the same time, you mentioned that you're earning a greater margin on that business. Is that margin reflective of you're one of the few companies that can do this work? Or are you assuming a little bit higher risk profile on these projects and that accounts for a little bit higher margin?","James F. O'Neil","I think, mostly, we're being -- we're involved more with the customer from planning these programs from a constructibility standpoint. We have the resources and the scope and scale to accomplish these large-scope projects in the timeline that they need to accomplish them. We're providing a broader solution to these customers to give them more predictability that their projects will get finished on time and on schedule, where others have had issues doing that. So when you provide more solutions to a customer than a discrete service, the opportunity to -- for that customer to see that value creates the opportunity for us to make slightly better margins on those programs.","Jonathan P. Braatz - Kansas City Capital Associates","Okay. So no -- not really a higher risk profile then?","James F. O'Neil","Well, when you take over more -- you're going to take over more risks when you take over more of those services, providing solutions. These projects are more complex, so the contractor does have more risk. But we do believe that, that risk is mitigated. We have an excellent track record since our inception of performing electric transmission programs and don't anticipate any issues. The more risky your project is, whether it's in a more environmentally-sensitive area or a more difficult geographical terrain, the further that differentiates us from your competitor because you are taking more risk. But we like that, we do that very well and we believe we mitigate those risks very well also.","Operator","There are no further questions. Are there any further points you wish to raise?","James F.

Jim?","James O'Neil","Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with an operational overview before turning the call over to James Haddox, Quanta's CFO, to provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Following James' comments, we will welcome your questions.","Our fourth quarter results are reflective of strong execution by our operations. Our revenues grew 37% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, and our GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 100% and 78%, respectively, over the same period last year. The overall momentum in our business, particularly the number of electric transmission projects in construction, drove revenues higher in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. As a result, we experienced sequential revenue growth of 21% and growth in GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share of 28% and 41%, respectively, versus the third quarter of 2011.","Here's some additional financial data to put our comments about the momentum in our business into context. Revenues in the last 6 months of 2011 increased almost 49% over revenues from the first 6 months of 2011, and operating income increased more than fivefold when comparing the same periods. Further, revenues for the last 6 months of 2011 increased approximately 20% over revenues for the last 6 months of 2010, and operating income increased about 25% for the same period comparison. Our strong fourth quarter and second half of 2011 results support our optimism for continued profitable growth in 2012.","For the full year of 2011, revenues increased approximately 18% despite project delays across all of our operating segments in the first half of the year, caused mainly by heightened regulatory environment. The primary driver of our 2011 revenue growth came from our Electric Power and telecommunications segments, which increased revenues year-over-year by approximately 48% and 23%, respectively.","Our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment had a challenging year from both a revenue and profit perspective. But as I will discuss later in my comments, there are indications that 2012 should be a better year than 2011 for this segment. Both our 12-month and total backlog at year end were at record levels. Our 12-month backlog at the end of 2011 increased about 24%, and total backlog increased approximately 15% compared to backlog at year-end 2010.","Turning to our Electric Power segment. 12-month backlog at the end of 2011 for the Electric Power segment increased nearly 32%, and total backlog for this segment increased nearly 11% compared to the end of 2010. We believe we are still in the early stages of a multiyear transmission build out in the United States and Canada and expect our Electric Power segment backlog to remain strong throughout 2012 and beyond.","The large electric transmission projects that we have in progress continued to proceed as expected without meaningful delays. I would like to take a moment to highlight a few of the large transmission projects we have for additional color.","The Sunrise Powerlink project for San Diego Gas & Electric, our CREZ project for Lone Star Transmission and the Bruce to Milton line for Hydro One should all be completed around the middle of this year. However, our CREZ work for ETP and Sharyland, BC Hydro's Northwest Transmission Line and the Devers-Palo Verde 2 line for Southern Cal Edison will all be ramping into construction about the same time. I would point out that we expect the timing of large transmission project awards to be lumpy going forward. Therefore, we recommend that investors focus on new award activity over a longer term rather than on a quarterly basis.","As we highlighted in our third quarter 2011 earnings call, the smaller transmission market remains very active. And due to the significant increase in overall transmission spending and activity, we're seeing pricing on smaller transmission projects improve as industry construction resources approach capacity.","I would like to recognize our employees' dedication to safely executing projects during a period of significant ramp-up in transmission project activity. Our employee count at the end of 2011 was approximately 17,500 or a 28% increase over the same period last year, primarily driven by the increase in our electric transmission operations.","In 2011, our electric distribution business experienced modest recovery for the first time since 2008. In addition, we recently executed a 3-year extension to our electric distribution system outsourcing agreement with Puget Sound Energy. We are cautiously optimistic that our distribution revenues will be flat to slightly up in 2012.","Due to the delays on several solar project awards in 2011, our renewable revenues for the full year were $219 million, a decrease of 30% over 2010. We believe the delays were caused in large part by developers waiting for solar panel prices to settle at lower price levels. However, we are seeing a good pipeline of solar engineer, procure and construct, or EPC opportunities, moving forward in 2012 and 2013. ","The wind market was also significantly impacted in 2011 because of low natural gas prices and project financing challenges. However, we are seeing signs that the market for wind power generation is recovering.","Overall, we expect double-digit revenue growth in our renewable segment in 2012 versus 2011, driven mostly by solar EPC opportunities. Note that we expect the timing of solar project awards could be less predictable due to the regulatory environment, availability of project financing and other factors. ","We entered the fourth quarter of 2011 with about $250 million in pipeline projects that we're moving into construction, giving us a reason to be optimistic about our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment. During the fourth quarter, we began working on several pipeline projects in various shales in the United States and a pipeline project in Canada. One of our projects in the Marcellus experienced challenges due to excessive rain that impacted production.","We also experienced reduced profitability on a few Marcellus projects due to a 10-day union labor strike that negatively impacted the production on those projects. The short-lived strike occurred due to a dispute over pension plan obligations between the International Brotherhood of Teamsters labor union and the Pipe Line Contractors Association, of which certain Quanta operating units are members. The parties are currently in the process of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement.","Our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment 12-month and total backlog at the end of 2011 increased about 3% and approximately 31%, respectively, as compared to the end of 2010.","2011 was a very challenging year for our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment, but we are encouraged by what we see so far in 2012 and believe our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment is better positioned today for profitable growth than it was at this time last year. Since the end of 2011, we have been awarded an additional $200 million of pipeline projects to date and are currently bidding or negotiating approximately $2 billion of additional pipeline projects, which we expect to be awarded to contractors this year. As a result of our efforts to diversify our transmission pipeline service offering, of the pipeline projects that we have been awarded in the fourth quarter of 2011 and to date in 2012, more than half of these projects are shale gathering system projects. This compares to having no shale gathering system projects in hand at this time last year.","In addition to seeing projects materialize in the backlog, we are also seeing projects expected to move into construction earlier this year than what we traditionally see. Both are positive signs.","Our telecommunications segment continues to experience momentum and improved financial performance, which we believe will continue through 2012. 12-month backlog for this segment increased about 47% at the end of 2011 as compared to the end of 2010. The increase in revenues, margins and 12-month backlog for this segment was driven by increases in the engineering and start-up of broad-based stimulus projects, fiber-to-cell site projects and wireless-related work. We continue to see opportunities from wireless and fiber-to-cell site initiatives, driven by strong wireless data growth, efforts to improve 3G wireless networks and from 4G and LTE wireless network upgrades and deployments.","Further, we are in late-stage discussions with several wireline companies for master service agreements that should generate additional recurring revenue from our Telecom segment going forward. We anticipate this segment's revenues will continue to grow at double-digit rates, with attractive margins through this year.","For our Fiber Optic Licensing segment, 12-month backlog increased about 4% at the end of 2011 as compared to the end of 2010. We continue to build out our networks and believe that the increase in sales activity we experienced in 2011 will continue in 2012, setting the stage for a pickup in revenue growth in the latter part of this year and into 2013.","In our earnings release this morning, we provided our financial expectations for the first quarter and full year of 2012. James will review that detail in his comments, but I wanted to provide some additional color as to our approach in developing our expectation. One difficulty in forecasting our final -- financial expectations is that we have been and are operating in a very challenging environment due to the economic uncertainty and, in particular, tougher permitting requirements, heightened environmental sensitivities, new regulations and the inconsistent interpretation of existing regulations. These factors are outside of our control, and they impacted the timing of project awards and project starts for us last year.","Considering our experience in the first half of 2011, we continue to implement a financial forecasting approach that strives to properly align ongoing regulatory and economic uncertainties in our business, with the backlog we are executing on and the opportunities we expect to materialize in 2012.","In summary, we continue to see positive trends across all of our operating segments as we move through the first quarter of 2012. We believe we are better positioned, and indications are improved operating environment in our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment should produce better results for this segment in 2012 versus 2011. We have record levels of backlog and expect meaningful increases in projects ramping up across all of our segments throughout 2012.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to James.","James Haddox","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.51 billion for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $1.11 billion in the prior year's fourth quarter, reflecting growth of 36.8% quarter-over-quarter. ","Net income attributable to common stock for the quarter was $66.3 million or $0.32 per diluted share. Included in net income attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2011 is a $32.6-million charge to cost of services, or $20.4 million net of tax, related to a pension plan withdrawal liability. Also included in net income attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2011 is $10.7 million of income from the release of income tax contingencies and settlements of certain tax audit. The net impact of these 2 items to the fourth quarter of 2011 resulted in a $0.04 reduction in diluted earnings per share.","The growth in consolidated revenues in 4Q '11 was driven by strong growth in the Electric Power and Telecom Infrastructure Services segments, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment.","Contributing to our increased revenues in the fourth quarter of 2011 was the incremental contribution of approximately $52 million in revenues in the quarter from companies acquired since the beginning of 4Q 2010. Excluding revenues from these acquisitions, consolidated revenues would have grown 32% quarter-over-quarter.","Our consolidated gross margin decreased from 14.4% in 4Q '10 to 13.3% in 4Q '11. This decrease was due to the impact of the previously mentioned $32.6-million pretax charge for the pension plan withdrawal liability, which affected the Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment. Consolidated gross margins without the effects of this charge were 15.4%, an increase of 100 basis points over 4Q of '10.","Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $5 million in the 2011 fourth quarter to $99.5 million as compared to last year's fourth quarter. This increase is primarily attributable to $8 million in higher salary and benefits costs associated with the increased levels of activity, as well as $4.8 million in additional administrative expenses associated with companies acquired since October 1, 2010. These increases are partially offset by $7.4 million in lower acquisition costs. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and admin expenses decreased from 8.5% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 6.6% in the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to the higher overall revenues as previously discussed.","Our consolidated operating margin before amortization expense increased from 5.9% in 4Q '10 to 6.7% in 4Q '11. Excluding the pension plan withdrawal charge, operating margin before amortization expense would have been 8.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011.","Drilling further down into the details of our results by segment, the Electric Power segment's revenues were up about $378 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 63%. Revenues were positively impacted by higher revenues from Electric Power transmission services resulting from an increase in the number and size of projects that were ongoing in Q4 '11 compared to Q4 '10. Also contributing to this increase was the incremental contribution of $46 million in revenues from acquired companies and $29 million in higher emergency restoration services resulting from early winter storm weather in the Northeast. Excluding revenues from the acquisitions completed since the beginning of 4Q '10, the Electric Power segment's revenues would have grown approximately 56% quarter-over-quarter.","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment was 13.4% in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 9.8% in last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to higher overall revenues, which resulted from an increase in services on higher-margin transmission projects, as well as from the increases in higher-margin emergency restoration services. Additionally, these increased revenues contributed to this segment's ability to cover fixed and overhead costs.","Natural Gas and Pipeline segment revenues decreased quarter-over-quarter by 5.1% to $379 million in 4Q '11, due to a decrease in the number and size of transmission pipeline projects, primarily as a result of delays in spending by our customers. These decreases were partially offset by increases in revenues from natural gas distribution services, due to the Puget Sound Energy distribution work, which we started in the second quarter of 2011, as well as increased spending by certain of our customers. ","Operating income in the Natural Gas and Pipeline segment as a percentage of revenues decreased to negative 9.6% for 4Q '11 from a positive 5.5% for 4Q '10. This decrease was primarily due to the $32.6-million charge to this segment's operating results in the fourth quarter of 2011, associated with a pension plan withdrawal liability. Excluding this expense, operating margins for natural gas would have been a negative 0.1% in 4Q '11.","The recognition of the pension plan withdrawal liability in the fourth quarter of 2011 resulted from the withdrawal from the Central States Plan by certain of our subsidiaries, following an amendment to a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters that eliminated our obligation to contribute to the Central States Plan. The Central States Plan's obligations for vested benefits are significantly underfunded, and Quanta believes that withdrawal from the Central States Plan was advantageous because it limited Quanta's exposure to increased liabilities from a future withdrawal if the funding status of the Central States Plan deteriorates further and additional plan participants withdraw from the plan.","Also contributing to the decrease in margins quarter-over-quarter was the impact of increased project costs related to performance issues caused by adverse weather conditions. As Jim mentioned, we also experienced reduced profitability on certain shale-related projects due to a Teamsters union labor strike that negatively impacted the production on those projects. The effect of the strike reduced profitability of those projects in the fourth quarter and will carry a reduced profitability assumption in 2012 for the remainder of the affected projects, due to percentage-of-completion accounting requirements. ","Revenues from our telecommunications segment increased $47.4 million or 57% to $130.8 million in 4Q '11, primarily due to an increase in the volume of work associated with stimulus-funded fiber optic construction projects and higher revenues from \"fiber to the cell\" site initiatives resulting from higher capital spending by our customers.","Operating margin in the telecommunications segment was 11.9% in 4Q '11 compared to 2.8% in 4Q '10. This increase in margin is primarily due to increased demand for our services allowing for margin expansion, as well as the impact of revenue increases on this segment's ability to cover fixed costs. ","Fiber Optic Licensing segment revenues were $29.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting an increase of 5.6% over 4Q '10. Operating margin was 49.9% in 4Q '11 compared to operating margins of 48.0% in 4Q '10.","When calculating operating margins by segment, we don't allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization expense to our segments. Therefore, the previous discussion about operating margins by segment excludes the effects of such expenses. Corporate and unallocated costs decreased $9.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower acquisition and integration costs of $7.4 million and lower amortization expense of intangible assets of $1.7 million.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share, as calculated in today's press release, was $0.41 for the fourth quarter of 2011 or a 78% increase when compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.23 for 4Q '10.","Our year-to-date negative free cash flow position as of 9\/30\/11 turned around to positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter of '11, despite revenue in the fourth quarter being $262 million higher than in the third quarter of '11. Cash flow from operations of $126 million, less net capital expenditures of about $39 million, resulted in approximately $87 million in free cash flow for the quarter. For the full year of 2011, cash flow from operations of $218 million, less net capital expenditures of about $162 million, resulted in approximately $56 million in free cash flow despite revenue growth of 37% in the fourth quarter.","EBITA for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $96.8 million or 6.4% of revenues, compared to approximately $64.3 million or 5.8% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $165 million or 11% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $105 million or 9.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010.","For the 12 months ended 2011, adjusted EBITDA was $407.1 million or 8.8% of revenues, compared to $434.2 million or 11% of revenues for 2010.","Our days sales outstanding or DSOs were 68 days at December 31, 2011, versus 75 days at September 30, '11, and 68 days at December 31, 2010. And the calculation of EBITA and the EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, all non-GAAP measures, and the definitions of these and DSOs can be found in the Investors & Media section of our website at quantaservices.com.","At December 31, 2011, we had $191.4 million in letters of credit outstanding, primarily to secure our insurance program, and had no other borrowings. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we have $350 million in cash. Considering our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we have nearly $824 million in total liquidity as of December 31.","We closed one Electric Power acquisition during the fourth quarter for a purchase price of approximately $35 million, comprised of $25.3 million in cash and $9.7 million in Quanta stock.","Concerning our outlook for 2012, we expect revenues for the first quarter of 2012 to range between $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion, and diluted earnings per share to be $0.14 to $0.16 on a GAAP basis. This estimate compares to revenue of $849 million and a loss of $0.08 in GAAP EPS in the first quarter of '11. Our GAAP EPS forecast for 1Q '12 includes an estimate of $6.1 million for noncash compensation expenses and $9.2 million for amortization expenses. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter is expected to be $0.19 to $0.21 and compares to non-GAAP adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.05 in the first quarter of '11. This non-GAAP measure is calculated on the same basis as the historical calculations of adjusted diluted earnings per share presented in the press release.","On an annual basis, we expect revenues for 2012 to range between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion and diluted earnings per share to be $0.90 to $1.10 on a GAAP basis. This estimate compares to revenues of $4.6 billion and $0.62 in GAAP EPS in 2011. Our GAAP EPS forecast for 2012 includes an estimate of $25 million for noncash compensation expenses and $34 million of amortization expenses. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2012 are expected to be $1.08 to $1.28. We're currently forecasting net income attributable to noncontrolling interest to be approximately $3 million in the first quarter of 2012 and $16.4 million for the year.","For additional guidance, we are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 37% for 2012, and we expect our diluted share count to be about 211 million shares for 2012. We expect CapEx for all of 2012 to be approximately $190 million to $225 million, which includes CapEx for our fiber licensing segment of about $40 million to $50 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2011 of $172 million.","Looking back at 2011, the first half of the year was challenging due to abnormal weather patterns and project delays across all of our operating segments as a result of a significantly more difficult regulatory environment. Despite project delays during the first 6 months of 2011, we continued to win work, which drove our backlog to record levels at the end of each quarter throughout 2011. The delayed projects in all of our operating segments began moving into construction in the second half of the year, which resulted in significant revenue growth, better margins and strong earnings growth relative to the first half of the year.","We also had several financially oriented accomplishments in 2011. We announced a $100-million stock repurchase program in May, increased the authorization level by an additional $50 million in June and completed the $150-million stock repurchase program in August. In total, we repurchased about 8.1 million shares at an average price of $18.39. In August, we amended and expanded our credit facility from $475 million to $700 million and extended the maturity date to August 2016. We leveraged our balance sheet strength over the course of the year to win work and provided significant working capital to our operations to fund the simultaneous ramp-up of a number of large projects. And we funded an investment in the pipeline company in the Eagle Ford Shale and the acquisition of 5 companies in 2011 that strategically expanded our geographic presence and provided us with unique technologies to further differentiate our service offerings from the competition.","As Jim commented, we entered 2012 with quite a bit of momentum in our business. We believe that we're operationally and financially well-positioned for solid growth in 2012 and beyond.","This concludes my prepared remarks, and we're now happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Will Gabrielski with Lazard Capital Markets.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","So I have 2 questions. The first is, on the projects you have winding down this year, then you're replacing that work in transmission with a few projects that are ramping up, can you talk about how your visibility is on the ramp-up and mobilization for those projects compared to what we saw last year when there were some challenges?","James O'Neil","Yes, Will. We don't see any challenges with those projects. They for the most part have gone through the permitting process. And they're not in poor service lands. So we don't expect any issues. Certainly in Texas, in the CREZ project, they should go forward. The Devers project should go forward without any issue and so should the Northwest Transmission Line. So we don't anticipate any delays.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, I'm just curious. If you can give a little more detail now that the shale work, the gathering work is increasing as a percentage of your pipeline business, what the average length of project is there, the type of visibility you have, margin and risk, and how that could impact the gas business over the next few years.","James O'Neil","Yes. The projects are smaller diameter pipes, smaller distances. They typically can -- the range can vary from $8-million, $10-million project to a $40-million, $50-million project. But it's recurring work. There's a significant amount of activity for several customers. It's almost like an MSA-type work. We've got a lot better visibility in that work than we do in the big pipe business. But there's a significant amount of gathering systems that need to be built, specifically in the shale areas that have a liquid component. We're very active in the Marcellus right now. The margin profile is very similar to what we see on the big pipework, and the visibility is a lot better.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Beach with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jeffrey L. Beach - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","My questions are -- revolve around the pipeline operations. First, the fourth quarter profitability, you were hit by weather and a strike, but it still looks like disappointing profitability in the fourth quarter on what looked to be reasonably good revenues. Can you just expand, maybe talk about profitability without the onetime items and a little bit more about profitability going into 2012 in this business?","James O'Neil","Yes, Jeff. And I would add to that, there were some regulatory delays, too, that affect the business, which continues to hamper that segment throughout the year. I mean, we've had $1.8 billion worth of projects that I think probably less than half -- actually, more than half have been canceled or delayed. So -- but I think we would have been pretty close to what we forecasted for that segment. The 10-day strike that we had certainly impacted us a couple of pennies, and the weather issues as well. We -- and the regulatory delays impact us as far as trying to efficiently mobilize people and equipment. So for that segment, we should have -- without those issues, we would have been close to our forecast for that segment for the quarter. Going forward, we're very excited. I mean, we certainly -- first quarter is typically not a busy time for -- typically from a seasonal standpoint, this segment is typically very -- not very active, would typically ramp up in the second and third quarter. We've got a lot of activity in the first quarter right now. Certainly, there's some weather risks because of that. It's typically why pipeliners don't build in the first quarter. But we think that going into this year, we've got great visibility. We've got a good book of business to get us into the first part of the year. We're seeing some opportunities this year that we believe will convert into construction opportunities. And we certainly feel like we'll have a very profitable year in our pipeline segment this year. But we've got the regulatory issues. We've got to keep in mind, that hasn't eased at all. So we've got to take in account that the regulatory environment is still very onerous in that segment.","Jeffrey L. Beach - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","If you were able to exclude, kind of take out the large pipeline projects in 2011, can you put kind of a range around the growth of everything else, all the shale work, the smaller pipelines, the pipeline inspection, the gas distribution? Can you give us an idea how much that underlying business is growing?","James O'Neil","Well, why don't I put it in context of what we're going to do in '12? I mean, going into '12, backlog in that segment at the end of '11 was about $768 million. We've added about $200 million of work into backlog since then. We've had some burn. But I would say that more than half of that backlog is associated with shale gathering work and the collections system work in these shales, particularly the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. So a significant part of our backlog has transitioned to shale work going into 2012.","Jeffrey L. Beach - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And last question, on your -- I don't know if it's described -- joint venture with Howard Energy, can you give us an update on what's happening there?","James O'Neil","Yes, I mean, that project continues to -- that pipeline is continuing to perform nicely. James could probably give you some updates on that. But I'll talk to you about the construction synergy opportunities first. We're still in the very early stages, the top of the first inning in developing Eagle Ford collection system infrastructure or in building infrastructure. And we feel that if that relationship is going to bring us some pull-through value -- it already has to some degree. We've had some smaller engineering opportunities and construction opportunities there because of that relationship. And we believe that we'll be able to build on that over the next few years because we've got that presence with Howard Energy in the Eagle Ford. So it's still early. But I expect some opportunities because of that investment due to come, to see evidence of as we move forward and develop -- as that field develops.","James Haddox","Yes, Jeff. I mean, there's -- there continues to be significant drilling activity in the Eagle Ford, which results into opportunities for Howard Energy both on the development of additional pipelines and on the construction side. Howard Energy is actually made up of a small construction company and a pipeline system. So they're seeing opportunities. Both of them were performing -- the construction company is performing better than we expected it to, and the pipeline company is performing about where we expected it to. But there's still significant activity going on in the Eagle Ford, which gives them opportunities for construction and pipeline development.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Mannes from Avondale Partners.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions. First, on the electric segment, as far as we can tell, this is probably the best margin you put up in any single quarter, along with the best revenue. When you think about the margin contribution, was there anything materially different about this quarter aside from just a higher utilization? I mean, was there any weather benefit, whether from storm work or alternatively from pull-forward work because of fairly benign weather? Anything else we should think about in terms of sustainability?","James Haddox","Yes, Dan. There weren't any -- I mean, if you're asking if there were any closeout -- big profits booked on closeouts of jobs, no, we didn't see anything like that. We did get some benefit, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, about increased weather -- I mean, increased storm activity, increased emergency restoration services. It was about $29 million over the prior year. It was $45 million in total. So you do get some boost from that. But it's not a real significant number. It was just improving margins basically on the ramp-up of some of these jobs. I mean, you're going to see some quarterly variances just based on seasonality, but sustainability should be fine in that segment.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then real quick on another topic on the fiber business. It looked like the rate of growth in revenue and in backlog was a little bit lower in '11 than where we've seen. Anything changing there in terms of your strategy? Or I don't know, if there's been any change in terms of the universal service line and the E-rate program that might be slowing that?","James Haddox","No, actually, we think you will see a pickup in that. I mean, we -- this year, in 2011, we spent probably -- I think somewhere between $17 million and $20 million in capital on that. And that was because of the slowdown, predominantly in California, with budgetary constraints by the school districts. So we only spent $17 million this year. But their sales season doesn't really -- is ramping up about right now. So you don't see it flow through their backlog numbers or anything else at year end because their sales season is still underway. But we are projecting that we're going to spend $40 million to $50 million next year. So that shows you that, that business is recovering.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of William Bremer with Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Can you give us a little bit more color on the strike on the United Steelworkers union? I mean, is it going have any other effects in any other projects going forward as this continues with the bargaining with the union?","James O'Neil","Well, we are in negotiations -- or the PLCA, which is the Pipe Line Contractors Association, in which Quanta -- certain Quanta entities as well as 70 other pipeline contractors are members of, is currently in negotiation on a new agreement. From what I understand, those negotiations are going well, and I don't expect to see any other strike impacts on our work going forward.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","So we shouldn't expect to hear of any additional charges in the first half of '12?","James O'Neil","Because the strike occurred in January -- many of the jobs that we're on occurred from December into January. You will have some impact of the strike in the first quarter performance. But that's already baked into our guidance.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then going to the pipeline segment, you called out that pricing there starting to -- on the smaller scale, just as strong as the larger, which I find quite surprising but also very solid for you guys. What does the large scale pipes and the channel there look like currently?","James O'Neil","The large scale pipeline opportunities, we see those opportunities there. The regulatory environment is much more difficult. So it's hard for us to forecast when those projects will be awarded to a contractor and moved to construction. The shale work is more predictable. It's more recurring. The margin profile is similar because the projects that we're working on -- that we work on are large -- larger scale projects in those shales are very difficult to negotiate. They're in very difficult terrain, or in very populated areas where they use contractors like Quanta to do the work. And that certainly commands margins that are very similar to the big pipe work.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Obviously, great work on the electric transmission side. I would love to know about some of the prospects there. I know they're going to be lumpy. But if you can talk about what you see in Canada, which seems to be a fairly exciting market, any update there? And then number two, in terms of the pipeline prospects, there's a bit of skittishness in the market on account of natural gas rigs in the shale plays, et cetera, on the traditional dry side really coming down. So any comfort you can provide in terms of your prospects being more oriented towards liquids plays and oil plays will be helpful.","James O'Neil","Yes, I mean, I'll address the gas question first. You are seeing some of the developers curtailing operations in the dry gas fields, but on the contrary, we're seeing significant opportunities where assets are being moved to these areas of liquid-rich plays. We have customers that are behind on their capital programs. They've got significant amount of infrastructure that they need to build. So we're very comfortable that these liquid-rich plays will continue to be very active through 2012 and beyond. There's just a significant amount of infrastructure that needs to be built despite the low natural gas prices. I mean, for instance, in the Eagle Ford, it costs $0 to produce gas because the oil production covers the capital cost for all of the development and infrastructure that needs to be built. On the transmission side, gee, there's a significant amount of projects out there. Certainly, Canada is a very active area for us. You've got CapX2020, the rest of that. You've got Gateway. You've got some more projects in California. The Northeast still is in the very early stages of building out infrastructure. Midwest with ATC and ITC. You've just got a significant amount of activity, and we continue to think that backlog will be strong. Going into this year, we will have additional awards. But the permitting and regulatory process continues to be a concern, and we don't have that visibility on how that will impact awards for the end of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ahmar Zaman with Piper Jaffray.","Shawn E. Lockman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","This is Shawn for Ahmar. Could you come back to your comments you made on the solar business? If you could just provide some visibility to what you're seeing this year in terms of -- the U.S. market is supposed to be -- have a very strong year in terms of solar installs. And if you could just give us some idea of what you're seeing there in terms of opportunity and increased activity for Quanta.","James O'Neil","Yes. And we had a hard time understanding, but I think the question is giving some color on the solar market in 2012. A lot of the opportunities that we're seeing in '12 and '13 are from developers taking advantage of the 1603 Cash Grant. And we're hopeful or very -- there's some promising opportunities for us that we believe will come to fruition soon to fill out our backlog for 2012 and '13. But that's what's driving the business that we see. I think over the long term, we don't have the visibility. But I think as we've always said, that the RPS standards in the states, the 30 states that have the mandatory RPS standards, at the end of the day, that's going to drive activity regardless of what government subsidies that we -- that developers receive. So certainly in '12 and '13, we see a very active year, largely driven by the expiration of the 1603 Cash Grant and developers taking advantage of that opportunity.","Shawn E. Lockman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great. And if I could just ask one more renewable energy-related question. On the -- in terms of -- I guess on your transmission business or your electricity business, any visibility out there that you guys -- or any impact on the business right now in terms of just smart grid-related installs, what you guys are seeing just on smart grid side? Or is it mostly just on transmission that you're seeing everything? Anything smart grid-related that is a good opportunity out there for you guys?","James O'Neil","I mean, smart grid continues to progress within our company. We're doing mostly distribution installations for smart grid. The CenterPoint program is the poster child of our smart grid implementation that we're doing now with IBM and Itron, where we're installing 2.2 million meters. We are continuing with smart grid programs in the Midwest and in Florida and in some of the smaller munis and co-ops. So that continues. It's not a meaningful part of what we do, but we are seeing still robust activity largely on distribution systems, not on transmission systems.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So sticking with the gas business for a second, could you just provide a little bit of detail on the margin profile for the business? I know that you've mentioned that the small diameter work is -- or the gathering systems are comparable to some of the large diameter work that you're doing. And so I'm wondering, what's it going to take to get back to, let's say, normalized margins of mid to upper single digits in that business?","James O'Neil","We need the regulatory environment to improve first and foremost so that our customers can plan, work and move projects to construction in a predictable manner. And we can participate in that on the construction side. But let me get back, the margin profiles are higher on these smaller projects, too, because our margins are driven by the type of contract more than the type of work. So these smaller projects are firm, fixed-price bids, and they have risks associated with them, and so we are able to command higher margins in that business. And it's on the higher end of the scale of margins. It's probably in that 18% to 20% gross margin range. But what we need is the regulatory environment to improve, and we need to see more activity, more work to keep the people and equipment busy. And certainly, the shale activity that we're pursuing will give us a more recurring revenue stream, we hope, going into 2012 and beyond.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful commentary. And then just one follow-up question. On the transmission side of your business, you said that pricing was improving. I think you had mentioned earlier as well that you felt that margins could be sustained. So just to be clear, 2012, you would expect then margin improvement -- it should be pretty material improvement in that business versus 2011 just based on the trends that you're seeing.","James O'Neil","Yes. I mean, it's based off the trends we're seeing in the second half of this year. Now you have to take in account again the regulatory environment and the normal seasonality of the first quarter. But because we have better utilization of our people and equipment, we should be able to sustain those margins going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Levine with JPMorgan.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Question regarding the permitting environment. It sounds, Jim, in listening to you talk about the permitting environment -- I don't know if it's as bad as it's been; it just hasn't gotten better. We were sensing that visibility was improving around timing in the back half of last year. Now we're hearing that it doesn't seem to be. I'm wondering if you can provide a little bit more color on the permitting environment and maybe whether there's a difference in terms of the impact on your transmission business as opposed to the pipeline business, and whether there's any expectation or thought that things could get better this year, or whether it's just a wait-and-see.","James O'Neil","Well, that's a good question. The point we're trying to make and the reason why the environment's improved in the third and fourth quarters, because the projects that were facing those challenges, those regulatory challenges, moved through that process and moved to construction. But almost every one of the projects in the third and fourth quarter that we were working on were delayed. They should have started earlier in the year or the prior year. So any new awards that we receive may quite possibly face the same challenges. And so it's the new awards that we'll receive. And it's many projects, particularly that's in Forest Service lands or BLM lands, that are going to probably experience some delays. So that's why we're saying that we expect this to be a very active year in awards. But whether those projects move into construction in 2012 or not, we don't have that visibility. And that's what hurt us last year when we were trying to provide guidance, that exact thing. Because our customers told us projects were going to start, we put them in our forecast, and it didn't happen because of things beyond their control and our control, which is the regulatory process.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And that comment is relevant to both the pipeline and the transmission?","James O'Neil","Absolutely, absolutely. We had $1.8 billion worth of projects that we were shortlisted on or exclusively negotiating, not including Keystone. And almost -- over half of those were delayed or canceled last year. And we practically won $200 million, $250 million of that, and the other $500 million, $600 million went to competitors. And you look at every transmission project we're on, from Tehachapi to Sunrise to Greater Springfield to -- even CREZ had some delays. And we don't -- that landscape hasn't changed. So it's the new awards. And the reason it seems like it's better right now is because we had projects finally move through that bottleneck and move to construction. So that's the point. So any future awards are subject to being delayed. That's the way we're approaching it.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And that expectation is -- a more conservative expectation on timing is assumed within guidance.","James O'Neil","Well, I don't like to use the word \"conservative.\" I'm just trying to say, we're guiding to what the environment that we experienced in 2011. We're guiding to that -- that overall environment is what we're guiding to.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. You're not assuming any improvement...","James O'Neil","And if projects get awarded this year and they do move to construction like in a normal year before this administration or what we experienced 5 years ago, then it would probably be additive to guidance. But we want to see how that works out, how that plays out. We don't have that visibility. We have visibility into the first half of this year but not second half.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then one follow-up, if I may, and sorry if this was asked before. The strike-related charge, the impact associated with the cost percentage-of-completion accounting, did you quantify what the impact was in the first quarter of '12? Or would you be willing to?","James O'Neil","No, not at this time. It's too early to do that. I would just say we baked it into guidance, and leave it at that for now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","First question here is on the guidance. I'm having a hard time getting to the low end of guidance, to $0.90. Can you kind of explain what will be the scenario that would produce that type of result?","James O'Neil","A year in the pipeline segment or more specifically in the large diameter pipework, which it would include the shales, that would give us a break-even year. The pipeline is pretty much a range. Last year, we talked about the range being when these big transmission projects occurred, because we were going through the regulatory process. This year, it's the regulatory process around pipeline. I'm not talking about necessarily performance. I'm talking about delays. Of course, we have to perform, but it's delays and what we expect to come down the pipeline this year, no pun intended, but the regulatory environment could delay that. And that would give us a $0.90 scenario.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, this is kind of a good follow-up to that. But, Jim, on your long-haul pipeline equipment, what's your near-term strategy for what to do with that equipment?","James O'Neil","Well, you have to remember that there's a significant rental or lease model in -- where 40% to 50% of that equipment, of the non-core equipment, the common equipment that's used, dozers for instance, can be returned. So we've got the capability to do non-spreads, but you've got that rental model. And then there is some of our equipment that is -- that can be used in the smaller shales or in the shale work on that smaller pipework. It's just the specific equipment designed around 20-inch and larger pipe that's on the sidelines. And certainly, we need that capability. It's strategic, and we do see some big pipework coming down the pipeline, if it can get permitted. Then we'll need that equipment and that will be very profitable work for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with FBR.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Jim, how disappointed are you at the performance of the pipeline business in the fourth quarter?","James O'Neil","Well, that's kind of a loaded question. Sure, certainly, I'm disappointed because we didn't hit the forecast. But we -- because of the regulatory delays that we experienced, we saw an anomaly this year where we had an increasing activity in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, which would typically be a low year for any pipeline operation, because they don't want to risk the weather and the weather elements. And we have weather elements in the Marcellus in the Northeast. And I think we've done very well performing in the environment that we're under. The strike certainly was disappointing, but I'm very -- I think I would like to characterize it as I'm more excited about the outlook for pipeline. We had one bad year in pipeline. We had a great year in 2010, made $100 million in operating income or thereabouts. And we can return this group to profitability in 2012. I'm confident that we can, especially since we've repositioned our presence in the shale formations. The second and third quarter is where you really start getting some really good margins in that business. And I think you've got to look at pipeline on a full year basis in '12. And, yes, I'm disappointed in the fourth quarter. But I'm more optimistic about what we see in '12 for pipeline.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","You mentioned earlier that you've seen some improved pricing or profitability on smaller transition transmission projects, and I recognize that it's the different type of contract, like you said. But are you also seeing improved pricing in larger transmission projects? And if not yet, at what point do you think it might kind of work up the ladder?","James O'Neil","Well, I think pricing improvement in big -- in the electric transmission market is going to be driven by what labor rates do going forward. I think that's going to be a big driver because if people come -- become scarce and we renegotiate agreements, it could be a factor.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then lastly, you mentioned something about a pending Telecom MSA. Can you give us a little bit more color on that? Is it in the wireline or wireless space? How sizable is it? Is it with a new customer or an existing customer?","James O'Neil","They are existing customers and it's wireline. What happens is, when, typically, you get this amount of activity going on -- the wireline carriers are very active right now -- they need assistance in managing -- program managing their capital programs. So we're doing more of that function for them. It's more deployment of capital over a larger footprint. And so they tend to outsource that to folks like Quanta to do that work. So there's opportunities with existing customers that are meaningful, that should occur here this year, early this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions. Sorry to harp on the gas business again. But I guess, Jim or James, is there anything that we can do to restructure, rightsize, divest or potentially diversify the gas business to give us sort of more consistent margin or profitability? Just because, I mean, you can't really control the regulatory environment. So I guess I just get concerned that this will continue to be a drag. And then, James, I guess, how do you think about -- over what -- the long-term margin targets for Quanta, which have been in the 9% to 12% range, I guess, given the revenue base that we're going to be on in 2012, I would have hoped we would have been closer to that range. So what's the revenue number that you need to get to the 9% to 12% operating margin? Or what needs to happen to get to that margin target?","James O'Neil","Jamie, let me address it this way. The diversity of our service offerings is one of the core strengths of this company. Back in 2010, we didn't have a very good year in electric transmission. And the pipeline business was what carried this company, with $100 million in operating income. And, yes, we've had some regularity issues in pipeline, but we had the same regulatory issues in 2010 that pushed projects on the electric transmission side to where they are today. So I know we had a bad year in '11 in pipeline, but we're very bullish on the pipeline business...","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But I guess my problem is I never remember. Even with the difficulty and regulatory hurdles on Electric Power, you've never had losses. Or my recollection, I don't ever remember you -- the Electric Power division, even in the worst of times, putting up this type of performance.","James O'Neil","No, we didn't have losses like that, but I can tell you that price recovery to date has given us a great return from the date of acquisition. And we expect that it will return to profitability in '12 and beyond. It is a more cyclical business. It is -- does have less visibility. And I know that frustrates investors, but we're doing what we can to diversify that risk. That's why we're moving into the shale. So I think you're going to see a different profile this year. We've got $450 million in backlog already for this year in local shale work, which is at good margins. It's recurring revenue and there's more visibility there. So we are repositioning ourselves in that segment to be more profitable and have more recurring revenue over time.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just the last question on the longer-term margin targets. What needs to happen? Over what time period do you think you can get to the 9% to 12% targeted range?","James O'Neil","Yes. I mean, if we can get pipeline where it needs to be -- I mean, we're almost there. When you look at Telecom and electric and what they've done in the second half of this year, we're there. We need to get there in pipeline and we can. If we can get the regulatory environment to improve and we will reposition ourselves in these shales, we should be able to get there in pipeline as well.","James Haddox","In just normal years, Jamie, the pipeline business has created margins that would get us into that range. So we just need to have a good, normal year in pipeline to get there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Irwin with Wedbush Securities.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","First question I wanted to ask was about these multibillion-dollar pipeline integrity programs that are going in front of commissions right now. I think there is about 4 or 5 of them in front of the California Utility Commission (sic) [California Public Utilities Commission], and then there's others around the country. Can you talk a little bit about the potential opportunity in these programs for Quanta, given that you've worked with a number of these utilities over the years, and how we should look at this as a potential contribution, if there's anything in there in your guidance right now for '12?","James O'Neil","Craig, that's a huge opportunity for us over time. It's growing off a smaller base. It's probably less than 10% of the segment's revenues today, but I think that business can grow -- that segment of the business can grow at rates greater than any other segment because of the new things and requirements and so forth that are requiring more intrusive testing of the pipeline integrity. We just bought a pigging company. So now we are able to do our own internal assessment and provide data to the customer. I think we're the only full-service construction company that can now do pipeline, integrity and remediation and provide external and internal data to the customer on the integrity of that pipeline. So that's a huge opportunity for us. We're excited about it, and I think that is another area where we're going to further diversify the pipeline segment over time. That's recurring revenue and it's at good margins.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. Then the next question I had was on the regulatory environment. So Susquehanna-Roseland is the local line for me that, I guess, I have the most experience looking at from a regulatory standpoint. And there, we have an environmental impact report from parks that blatantly disregards the pre-existing easements, the pre-existing access roads, rights-of-way, and is myopic to the point where they don't even acknowledge that it's only 20 additional feet on one existing right-of-way that's really the additional land that's requested. Can you talk a little bit about these really cumbersome, almost obstruction-ary situations where the need is there to build the lines where the system operators are really calling for an in-service date that's unachievable at this point to preserve reliability? Can you talk a little bit about the recourse actions that could be taken by the different owners of these lines? I mean, you don't have to talk specifically to Susquehanna. But do you see more of these things actually moving into the courts given that there really is a reliability need?","James O'Neil","Yes, I mean, I think that's a perfect example of what our customers are facing. That's the reinterpretation of existing regulations. And this is a project that was delayed 2 years ago in June, and it's back on the drawing board again. But who knows what's going to happen? And if it goes into the court system because of reliability issues and if the line is determined to be needed, all that does is delay the construction of that line. And that's exactly the regulatory environment that we're facing today and why we've taken our approach on guidance, and I'm getting off track a little bit from your question, but that's a project that should be coming out soon and should be going to construction. So -- but is that really going to happen or not? I don't know. I'm not going to get into the other questions or comments you want me to make because I think that's more for our customers. I could just say that, that's the state of what our customers are going through today, and it impacts us as well.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And, Jim, I just want to touch on something you mentioned in there that I think is pretty important, just if you could clarify. So my takeaway from what you just said is that your guidance completely excludes all projects where there is this sort of political or regulatory uncertainty. And it strictly includes projects where you have a very high level of confidence that everything is green-lighted for construction and where there's reasonable expectations for significant increase in activity this year.","James O'Neil","I would say that's fair for large projects that we expect to be awarded in the latter half of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of -- with Andrew Wittmann of Robert W. Baird.","Andrew Wittmann","My question is on the Telecom business. And you mentioned a number of factors are really driving that business, Jim. The -- I guess my question is really regarding the stimulus benefit that you're experiencing. Can you just remind us how much of just maybe the work that you're doing today is really stimulus-driven and how long you expect the tail to be on that work?","James O'Neil","Yes, I think a significant amount of that is stimulus-driven, and we should see positive results from that well into 2013 on Telecom -- Telecom stimulus. And we're largely associated with it, obviously, everyone knows, but the wireline to unserved areas throughout the country. I mean, that's another example where these jobs should have started a year ago, but the environmental impact statements that needed to be filed delayed the process a year. And we all are now seeing the -- we're in the height of the construction period, and that should continue through most of '12 and probably start -- we'll still see some significant revenues in '13, but it will start winding down in '13. And then by that time, we should -- we think that there will be several customers -- or we know for a fact that there are several customers that received the benefit of stimulus that have additional capital programs that they want to bolt on to that program. So we think the spending will be very poor beyond 2013 because there's many customers that have capital they want to deploy as well. And then 4G and LTE should be increasing. So we think that we're not going to see this big drop-off in '13 because, certainly, we've got wireless opportunities increasing and customers that have capital programs on the wireline side that will continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Rogers with D.A. Davidson.","John Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just a couple of different questions. First of all, how much of your work are you expecting in 2013 to be in Canada -- or sorry, 2012?","James O'Neil","Probably close to 10%. I'm just giving you that directionally, 10%. Everything is going to go up, so the revenue in Canada should increase as well. But it should be approximately 10% of our revenues.","John Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And in terms of the large pipeline projects up there, I mean, it doesn't sound like you're banking on any of those moving forward in 2012 at that revenue rate.","James O'Neil","The large projects that would be done in Canada would be occurring right now probably. Because of the permafrost loss, most of that work is done in the first quarter. So that's probably a good assessment. And in '12, it would relate to the big pipe.","John Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, just back to the electrical business for a second. You talked -- or you mentioned that the distribution side of it was picking up a little bit. Is that -- and I know it's still relatively weak compared to what it was years ago, but is that helping margins? Or does it add revenue but dilute the margins a little bit?","James O'Neil","No, it should help margins. I mean, primarily -- I mean, overall, it's definitely going to help margins because you have a lot of distribution resources going to the small transmission market. So now that you've had distribution pick up, you've got some of those folks going back into distribution. And then it's making the small transmission market, the resources to perform that work even more scarce. Commodity is scarce. So -- but the distribution margins, we operate under MSAs and we've just had less people on those MSAs. So as they return under those agreements, the margins will improve.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Morris Ajzenman with Griffin Securities.","Morris Ajzenman - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Question is, 2012, clearly it looks like we'll have a material improvement versus 2011. With that as a backdrop, which sort of acquisitions for 2012 would you prefer to just keep low there and allow the better results to come to surface and be able to see that? Or are there still areas where you have a laser focus where you want some strategic acquisitions as far as this year is concerned?","James O'Neil","Our acquisition strategy really doesn't change in good times or bad. I mean, we're going to be opportunistic. And if we can find an acquisition candidate that adds a geographical footprint or enhances our core service offering or provides some technology differentiator or customer relationship, we'll look hard at making that acquisition. So, again, our approach to acquisition is pretty consistent, and it hasn't changed over the last 10 to 12 years.","Operator","Thank you. I'll turn it back over to management for any closing remarks.","James O'Neil","I'd like to thank you all for participating in our fourth quarter and full year 2011 conference call.

With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim O'Neil, Quanta's President and CEO. Jim?","James F. O'Neil","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with an operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our first quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","Quanta is off to a great start this year, posting record first quarter revenues and operating income. Our first quarter results reflect strong demand for our services and continued solid project execution. For the quarter, revenues increased approximately 19%, and GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased almost 55% compared to the same quarter last year. Our 12-month and total backlog increased both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. Our total backlog is also at record levels.","Our Electric Power segment continued to experience an increase in demand for electric transmission and distribution services. Regulations to improve grid reliability, renewable interconnections, the impact of coal to gas generation switching and other industry dynamics continued to drive power industry's investments in electric infrastructure.","The electric power industry is investing at record levels to upgrade and modernize North America's power grid. We believe this trend will continue over the next several years as the current level of investment is not sufficient to keep pace with the rate at which transmission and distribution systems are aging. Today, available construction resources in the electric power industry are in short supply and skilled labor is in high demand. In the future, we expect demand for our services in an already tight labor market to grow. As such, we see attractive opportunities for our Electric Power segment for the remainder of this year and beyond.","We continue to be awarded large transmission projects. During the quarter, we announced 2 large electric transmission projects, a 186-mile, 230-kilovolt line for SaskPower in Northern Saskatchewan and a 310-mile, 500-kilovolt HVDC line for ATCO Electric in Eastern Alberta. We are currently mobilized on 17 large transmission projects throughout North America with each project's contract value averaging over $200 million.","Smaller transmission project activity also remains very active as customers continue to upgrade existing transmission infrastructure to meet reliability standards and to interconnect with the significant number of large transmission projects that have been construction -- was constructed over the last several years. Also, growth in distribution activity has continued to accelerate following nearly 3 years of deferred maintenance during the recession as our customers increasingly focused on distribution asset management initiatives such as reliability and smart grid deployment.","Our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment delivered comparable revenues in this quarter versus the first quarter of last year, but operating income increased almost $20 million year-over-year. We are pleased with the improvement in this segment's profitability in the first quarter, and we expect continued profitability improvements throughout the year.","In the first quarter, Quanta was selected by Pacific Gas & Electric Company, or PG&E, to provide comprehensive pipeline system integrity solutions as part of PG&E's Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan. Quanta was awarded a 3-year alliance agreement with subsequent annual extensions to provide services such as pipeline replacement, hydrostatic testing and valve automation services. Quanta has begun working under this alliance agreement, and we estimate its value at approximately $100 million per year in revenues over the initial 3-year term. Several of Quanta's operating units are involved in this alliance agreement, illustrating the depth of expertise and the value proposition that Quanta brings to its natural gas utility customers.","Demand for pipeline services to support shale gathering infrastructure buildout was active in the first quarter and should remain so throughout the year and for many years hereafter as customers continue to invest in infrastructure needed to support the exploration of shale plays, particularly in liquid-rich shale formations.","Active discussions with customers regarding mainline projects continue. While we can't provide details at this time, we believe we will receive some project awards and mobilize on mainline projects in 2013. We also expect mainline project awards to make a significant positive impact on our company's overall performance in 2014 and beyond.","In our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment, revenues for the quarter increased nicely over the prior year period with consistent operating margins. The increase in revenues was primarily due to strong growth in providing telecommunications infrastructure services to non-telecom customers, coupled with steady growth in our Fiber Optic Licensing revenues.","As discussed in our earnings release, we have adjusted our full year 2013 guidance. We increased the lower end of our guidance primarily due to superior performance in the first quarter that exceeded our original expectations and slightly increased full year operating margin expectations for our Electric Power segment. We continue to reflect prudent expectations in our financial forecast particularly in the fourth quarter as the timing of electric transmission project awards, construction start dates and seasonality can impact our overall financial performance.","Additionally, we have no uncommitted mainline pipe construction revenues in our guidance for the remainder of 2013. While we believe mainline project construction revenues are likely this year, we will not include any projects in guidance until we have a signed contract and firm construction start date.","In summary, we had an exceptional first quarter. We continue to believe we are in a multiyear energy investment cycle and remain well positioned to maintain our leadership role in the industries we serve. We will continue to leverage this leadership position and execute on our strategic initiatives to grow both organically and through selective acquisitions as we actively pursue opportunities to expand the solutions we are currently offering to our customers.","Before I turn the call over to Derrick, I want to recognize John Colson, Quanta's founder and current Executive Chairman of the Board, who announced his plans to retire later this month. John had a vision in 1997 to form Quanta Services as smaller private contractors were not be able to keep up with the pace of transmission construction activity that we are experiencing today. As the first mover in the industry, Quanta Services is today an S&P 500 company. There have also been many other public companies that have modeled their business to be like Quanta. Not only is John a true friend and mentor to me as well as my entire leadership team, John Colson is a true pioneer and recognized leader in this industry. The electric power industry would not be where it is today without John's contributions. John, you will be missed greatly, and we wish you and your family the best. I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our Chief Financial Officer, for his financial review of the first quarter. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.59 billion for the first quarter of 2013 compared to $1.33 billion in the prior year's first quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 19% quarter-over-quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the quarter was $72.1 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, as compared to $45.8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the first quarter of last year.","The growth in consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2013 was driven primarily by increased revenues from our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. However, growth was seen in all 3 of Quanta's segments. Our consolidated gross margin increased to 15% in the first quarter 2013, from 14.0% in 1Q '12. This improvement was led by the profitable first quarter performance of the Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment as compared to last year's first quarter losses, as well as the impact of higher overall revenues, which improved our ability to cover fixed operating costs.","Selling, general and administrative of expenses were $113.7 million, reflecting an increase of $15.6 million as compared to last year's first quarter. This increase is primarily attributable to $11.6 million in higher salary and incentive compensation costs associated with increased levels of activity and profitability, as well as administrative cost associated with the companies acquired in 2012 and $1.3 million in higher costs associated with the various development initiatives.","As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 7.2% in the first quarter of 2013 from 7.4% in the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to the impact of higher overall revenues. Our consolidated operating margin before amortization expense increased to 7.9% in 1Q '13 from 6.6% in 1Q '12. Amortization of intangible assets decreased from $9.2 million in 1Q '12 to $5.3 million in the first quarter of 2013 as certain of these assets became fully amortized.","To further discuss our segment results, the Electric Power segment's revenues were up about $248.8 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 27%. Revenues during the quarter were positively impacted by higher revenues from electric power transmission projects and solar power generation projects as a result of increased capital spending by our customers.","Revenues from emergency restoration services are relatively consistent between periods with approximately $33.4 million occurring in the first quarter of 2013 and $32 million occurring in the first quarter of 2012. At the end of the first quarter, 12-month backlog for the Electric Power segment increased slightly to $2.8 billion as compared to the first quarter of 2012. Sequentially, 12-month backlog decreased slightly by 3.4% from the end of the fourth quarter of 2012 as certain renewable projects proceeded into construction during the first quarter of 2013. Total backlog for this segment remains strong at $4.84 billion.","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment decreased to 11.2% in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to 12.3% in last year's first quarter. The prior year's first quarter performance was positively impacted by favorable winter weather conditions, providing for excellent production on various electric projects.","Natural Gas and Pipeline segment revenues increased slightly quarter-over-quarter by 1% to $358.9 million in 1Q '13. However, operating income for the Natural Gas and Pipeline segment as a percentage of revenues increased to 2.9% in 1Q '13 from a negative 3% in 1Q '12. The operating loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, was primarily due to the increased project costs as a result of performance issues caused by adverse weather conditions on certain projects. The operating margins for this quarter are more representative of the margin we would expect with the seasonal effects in volumes and production during a typical first quarter, absent mainline pipework. At the end of the first quarter of 2013, 12-month and total backlog for this segment increased about 7% and 17%, respectively, compared to the end of the first quarter of 2012. As we've commented before, Keystone XL is not in any of the backlog figures presented for our pipeline segment.","Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment revenues were up $6.2 million or 15.7% to $45.8 million in 1Q '13 as compared to $39.6 million in 1Q '12. Additionally, operating margin remains relatively constant at approximately 36.9% in 1Q '13 as compared to 36.7% in 1Q '12.","When calculating operating margins by segment, we do not allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization expense to our segments. Therefore, the previous discussion about operating margins by segment excludes the effects of such expenses.","Corporate and unallocated costs increased $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to 1Q '12, primarily as a result of an increase of $5 million in various overhead expenses, the largest of which was $2.6 million in higher salary and incentive compensation costs associated with current levels of operating activity and profitability, partially offset by lower amortization expense of $3.9 million as a result of the burn off of required backlog.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as calculated in today's press release was $0.38 for the first quarter of 2013 as compared to an adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.26 from 1Q '12. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was approximately $44 million for the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the use of cash of $73 million for the first quarter of 2012.","Capital expenditures net of proceeds from equipment sales were about $56 million, resulting in approximately $12 million in negative free cash flow for the first quarter of 2013. This compares to $104 million in negative free cash flow for the first quarter of 2012.","Specifically, cash flow has been impacted by higher days sales outstanding, or DSOs. Our DSOs were 87 days at March 31, 2013, compared to 82 days at December 31, 2012, and 80 days at March 31, 2012. Continuing to impact DSOs are the change orders associated with the Sunrise project, which remain in cost and excess of billings. Several meetings occurred throughout the quarter and progress continues to be made. Substantive meetings are scheduled within the next 30 days, and we currently aren't aware of any circumstances warranting any adjustments to the amount invoiced.","EBITA for the first quarter 2013 was $119.3 million or 7.5% of revenues compared to $83.8 million or 6.3% of revenues for the first quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was $159.8 million or 10.1% of revenues for the first quarter of 2013 compared to $119.3 million or 9% of revenues for the first quarter of 2012.","The calculation of EBITA, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, all non-GAAP measures, and the definitions of these and DSOs can be found in the Investors & Media section of our website at quantaservices.com.","At March 31, 2013, we had about $184 million in letters of credit outstanding, primarily to secure our insurance program, and we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $367 million in cash with $112 million of the balance related to foreign operations. Considering our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we had nearly $883 million in total liquidity as of March 31.","Concerning our outlook for 2013, we expect revenues for the second quarter of 2013 to range between $1.45 billion and $1.55 billion, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be $0.30 to $0.32 on a GAAP basis. These estimates compare to revenues of $1.39 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.27 in 2Q '12. Our GAAP EPS forecast for 2Q '13 includes an estimate of $11.1 million for non-cash compensation expenses and $5.1 million for amortization expense. Included in our estimate of non-cash stock-based compensation for the second quarter and year of 2013 is approximately $4.2 million of expense or $0.01 per diluted share related to the accelerated vesting of equity-based awards associated with John Colson's retirement as Quanta's Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors effective May 23, 2013.","Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter are expected to be $0.35 to $0.37 when compared to our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.32 in 2Q '12. This non-GAAP measure is calculated on the same basis as the historical calculations of adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in this release.","We currently expect revenues for the full year 2013 to range between $5.9 billion and $6.3 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.20 to $1.40 on a GAAP basis. Our GAAP EPS forecast for 2013 includes an estimate of $32.8 million for non-cash compensation expense and $20.5 million of amortization expense. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2013 are expected to be between $1.37 to $1.57. We are currently forecasting net income attributable to non-controlling interests to be approximately $3 million to $4 million in the second quarter of 2013 and around $14.5 million to $15.5 million for the year.","For additional guidance, we're currently projecting our GAAP tax rate to be between 35.5% and 36% for 2013 and our diluted share count to be around 214 million shares. We expect CapEx for all of 2013 to be approximately $210 million to $225 million, which includes CapEx for our Fiber Licensing and Other segment of about $35 million to $45 million. This compares to CapEx from continuing operations for all of 2012 of $209 million.","This concludes our formal presentation. Other than to add an additional thank you to John from all of the employees of Quanta. We couldn't have had a greater leader. We'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Alex Rygiel from FBR Capital Markets.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So easy question. You beat the first quarter by $0.05 on the bottom line. You raised your low end of your guidance by $0.10. Was the first quarter -- did you have an extra $0.05 of cushion in the first quarter? Or do you have better visibility on the next 9 months such that you sort of raised the back end by $0.05?","James F. O'Neil","Well I'd say that the first quarter, I mean, obviously, we had 17 big transmission projects in construction and we did have some fairly good weather throughout the country, particularly, in Texas and California. So you just can't predict the weather. So I wouldn't have said we've baked in $0.05 before the quarter. You've got to understand the seasonality in the quarter and weather can be a big impact. For the rest of the year, we're just taking the same approach that we've taken 6 weeks ago when we talked to you guys in late February. And we're being prudent about the second half of the year because of the significant amount of our upcoming work will be big projects that are subject to -- the start dates are subject to movement and we're just being prudent about that so we get more visibility.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then secondly, your Natural Gas margins improved very nicely on a year-over-year basis. Can you give us a little bit more background on that? Was it pricing? Was it type of revenue or type of project or was it just purely better executions?","James F. O'Neil","I think it's a combination of all of those. We worked really hard in that segment. The first quarter is typically a very seasonal -- the segment is very seasonal over the year with the first quarter. Several years ago, we strived to breakeven in that segment. And now, because of the diversity of the services that we're providing with the shale gathering work, some pipeline integrity work, we've rebuilt our gas distribution business. We've done a really nice job bringing that to profitability, and we expect if we can execute, margins will improve over the year to where we'll have our full year margins without big pipe. The full year margins should be in that mid- to upper-single digit operating income range without big pipes. So we're real pleased with the first quarter and how we've moved that segment to profitability in the most seasonal quarter of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tahira Afzal from KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Your bookings in the quarter was really strong on a year-on-year basis. Is this trend going to continue in general to trend up as you're going to your seasonally high quarters? And is the mix increasingly going to be on the pipeline side or should we expect the same type of mix?","James F. O'Neil","Well we're going to be -- we've been consistent with our comments on backlog in Electric. We haven't seen any changes. It's a very strong market. The timing of projects awards quarter-over-quarter can be lumpy. But overall, we're saying backlog in Electric should be strong now. With that, if we get big pipe work toward the end of the year, the mix could shift somewhat could get a little bit higher percentage in backlog and pipeline, obviously, because those can be some fairly big projects. But overall, we haven't seen any changes in the overall business environment that we've been communicating to you guys over the last 2 years.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the follow-up question is on the pipeline side. And I'm cleverly trying to make it a twofold question because you only allow me 2 questions. So if I look at the Keystone Pipeline being officially pushed out by around 6 months, even if you start at the facade [ph] what you assume to be early 2014, I assume it does now project out a more stretched construction time frame. Does that allow you to look at your spreads appropriately and see if you can bid on more project going forward than new project you could? And the second part of the question is the timing on some of these mainline prospects. Clearly, there are huge number out there. Is the narrative timing going to be dictated by how economical rail looks as an alternative on the crude side?","James F. O'Neil","Well let me just say that the Keystone project has never impacted our ability to pursue other projects. So your question about Keystone being pushed into '14, whether that's given us the ability to pursue more work that we've always pursued as much work as we could. If we could get work at the margins that we expect to get work for, which we've been very disciplined on bidding these projects. And I would say that, we should hear some announcements hopefully about pipeline. We said -- for this year, we said it's likely that we'll probably do some big pipe work this year, so we're in some pretty detailed discussions right now. So hopefully, we will be able to talk about that in the near future. I mean, when you're building pipelines, the most active parts of the pipeline season is in the second and third quarter, and I don't expect that would change because the weather is more favorable then and there's less risk to building those lines for the customer and for contractor.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sorry, a couple of questions on guidance again. But anyway, the guidance in the quarter, I'm just trying to figure out, like, if I look at your second quarter guide relative to where you came in at the first quarter, it doesn't make a lot of sense because seasonally, the second quarter is generally stronger. So is there any pull forward? I'm just trying to understand if there's something in there that I'm not thinking about on just why your second quarter wouldn't be up more significantly relative to Q1. And then, on the Electric Power margin side, I'm just trying to get a feel for how you're thinking about your margins in 2013 relative to 2012, whether you think we can -- the pricing environment is strong enough and utilization is high enough that we could exceed sort of your targeted range of 9% to 12%. And then last question, if we were to handicap where the upside comes from in 2013, do you feel it's more a function of your first quarter good execution or is it a function of the big gas pipeline stuff like Keystone finally getting done?","Derrick A. Jensen","Jamie, this is Derrick. Actually, from a first and second quarter perspective, we have commented last time that we thought the seasonality was going to start to flatten out a little bit. When you look at 2012, in fact, you can see that on a -- after discontinued operations that the first and second quarters are relatively flat. When -- the other thing that's coming into consideration is we've got a lot of these large projects that Jim has talked about. A lot of that work is in California and Texas, which contributed to larger revenues in the first quarter relative to a seasonality perspective. And then lastly, we had a couple of solar projects that came through. So all those things kind of came to a combination effects for the first and second quarter. There was, as you alluded to, some pull forward from the second quarter into the first quarter based upon the good production we had for the period. And then relative to margins, we continue to guide to that 9% to 12% for the Electric Power. As we've commented, I think, last time, the 2012 was a phenomenal year for us throughout. We had great execution. We had very good weather. We had high storm work. So all of those things contributed to margins that were above that 9% to 12% range. But we continue to feel as though that the 9% to 12% range is a prudent guidance for us for -- in that segment. And as we stand here right now, I think that you'll see that the modeling works out that we're probably in the mid-portion of that range in our current guidance. And for the last component of it and as far as what's -- what can lead to some of those upsides, I think as Jim has alluded to, the opportunity for execution. That's really where it can come from similar to 2012. That's probably the primary driver.","Operator","Our next question comes from Will Gabrielski from Lazard.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Can you guys talk about the distribution market? And we're seeing a little bit of a recovery in housing or at least The Wall Street Journal says so every day on the cover. And I'm wondering how that's impacting the distribution business. And then on the maintenance side within that market, how far from peak levels we are and how that's progressing back towards what we saw few years ago?","James F. O'Neil","Well I would say we're hearing the same news about housing starts and there's a lag to the impact, the positive impact it would have to us. We're not really seeing any meaningful impact in our revenues related to housing right now. All of the growth that we've seen in distribution over the last 2 years and going into this year has been maintenance-related, reliability-related. And as far as where that goes, we're not seeing a slowdown. I can't predict what the peak would be, but we're still growing the distribution revenues related to reliability work and maintenance continues to grow in healthy clips. And we don't see it slowing down anytime soon.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in the pipeline integrity or pipeline modernization market, I think there's been some new laws passed over the past few months at least here in the Mid-Atlantic states that allow utilities better cost recovery on a more timely basis in that market. And I guess you had success with PG&E in the quarter. So I'm just wondering how big that market opportunity is starting to look to you versus 12 months ago, and what type of interaction you're having with customers about maybe MSA-type relationships or just bigger framework agreements?","James F. O'Neil","Yes. We were having active discussions with many customers on integrity programs throughout the country. And we've always said that our integrity business, although it's a smaller base, probably has more opportunity to grow at better clips than any other parts of our business. So it's an exciting part of our business, and we think it could be meaningful with the next 3 to 5 years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, just curious to get a sense of the margin profile of the pipeline backlog or the new orders that you're getting. Are you seeing better pricing and better margins in some of the upcoming orders? And I have a follow-up.","James F. O'Neil","Well most of the work that we have in backlog is probably out 2 to 3 months at the max. It's pipeline gathering work in the shale fields, and the margins have been pretty predictable over the last several years. We haven't seen much increase in those margins. But margins and backlog will either be equal or slightly higher than what we're experiencing today. We don't have any big pipe revenues to speak of in our backlog other than the project that starts in '14. And certainly, those margins would be higher in backlog when we start booking mainline pipe work hopefully over the next few months this year.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then on the Electric Power segment, just wanted to understand to what extent the improvement in margin expectations. Is this driven by pricing versus better execution? Are you seeing this -- the pricing environment continue to get better and therefore the upside to your margin expectations for the rest of the year?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, Vishal. I think it's a combination of both. I mean, certainly, we can have a year like last year where we had better execution, favorable weather and that certainly would put better margins to the bottom line. But also, margins and backlog are strong, and they continue to be equal to or better than what we're currently experiencing today. So it's a combination of both execution and the bidding environment in margins and backlog.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Good to see the Q1 profits in pipeline. But I guess the revenues were only up less than 1% year-over-year. So I guess I'm just wondering if we should assume a general slowdown in the outlook for shale pipeline project. And if not, why was it only up, I guess, 1%?","James F. O'Neil","Well that's going to be your seasonally low quarter for revenues in that segment. It's more difficult to build pipeline in the first quarter because of weather, particularly in the Marcellus, which is one of our most active areas. So that's by design. That should pick up in the second quarter and into the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, it's kind of a wildcard. It could be your second highest quarter. It could be -- you could continue to have revenues equal to what you experienced in the third quarter. But the first quarter is always going to be a seasonally low quarter for your pipeline segment and even in your gathering work.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So would you assume though that the year-over-year growth in the next few quarters should be better than kind of flattish?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, this is Derrick. I mean, when we provide a previous guidance for that, we have basically assumed that 2013 would be comparable to 2012. I would say at this stage in the game, we'd see at the mid- and high points, you see some small single-digit revenue growth though.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay, here are my questions. Was wondering if there was any particular substation work that impacted electrical transmission this quarter. My second question is if we go into a little bit -- you call that a little weather issues. There's been a lot of talk of some high degree of rain in the Midwest. How much did that, if any, can you call it and tell us about that impacted the pipeline arena? And then thirdly, on the pipeline integrity, is there any components at this time that you feel as though you need to either develop in-house or potentially acquire to really fulfill your portfolio in that area?","James F. O'Neil","We -- the impact of weather on our pipeline business in the first quarter was negligible. We didn't have any negative or positive impacts due to weather. As far as our integrity business, we believe, today, Bill, that we are a full service solution provider, and there's really not any gaps in our integrity business that we need to fill today other than just continue to pursue opportunities and build that business. And the first question?","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","The particular substation?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, the substation work pretty much flows with the amount of transmission work and distribution work. It rises and falls with that activity. So there was nothing out of the ordinary on substation in the first quarter other than it's very active just like transmission construction is today.","Operator","Our next question, Craig Irwin from Wedbush.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So my first question I wanted to ask is can you update us on the approximate size of the electric power opportunities that you're bidding right now. How does this change versus last year and whether or not you're seeing a mix shift either in the character of the projects or in the specific geographies that are offering the most exciting opportunities?","James F. O'Neil","Well there's still opportunities throughout the U.S. and North America in general, Craig. I mean we are having a shift obviously CREZ is rolling off in Texas. But there's still a significant amount of work to be done in Texas, but there are other areas in the country that certainly we'll be redeploying the resources to. There's opportunities to coal to gas switching. So when you talk about the drivers, we are seeing coal to gas switching being one of the bigger drivers of the transmission opportunities going forward for the remainder of the year and into '14.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. And then can you update us on dark fiber? Your last call, you said you thought that, that could grow. Double digits may be better this year. There were some pretty solid bookings in that segment in the quarter. How do you see dark fiber progressing over the course of 2013? Have these sort of headwinds of the fiscal discipline out there may be lifted off enough where we can see a number of these projects actually supported by the local customers?","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure, this is Derrick. As it relates to fiber, if you recall, now we have the non-telecom revenues buried within the fiber as far as from a segment perspective, but fiber overall is growing at a high single-digit rate at this stage in the game from a revenue perspective. The sales continue to be strong. 2012 sales for future revenue installs was basically double-digit. So from a revenue perspective, as we go through and build out those new networks from sales, I think we'll continue to see growth, thus the high-single digit to double-digit growth. Relative to the commentary of any of the sequestration or anything from spending, we're not seeing that really impact our business right now. I mean, a lot of the work that we're doing is associated with ongoing contracts. A lot of the sales that we're doing are for other incremental verticals like the financials rather than just relying on K-12. But the K-12 spending right now is still going good for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Rogers from D.A. Davidson.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I guess, first thing, in terms of the pipeline project opportunities, Jim, are they -- how quickly do you need to see that work actually get booked and actually executed this year? Is this something that we need to see in the second quarter given that's the time period when normally those projects come out?","James F. O'Neil","No, John. I would say that in the pipeline business on mainline pipe, once your notice of award -- you get the notice of award, you could mobilize immediately within the next week or 2 on that project. So it's very -- it's a very quick mobilization from the time of award. At least the projects that we're seeing here in the near term, that's the way it will be. So it's not like we get an award and then it goes to construction 6 months later. It moves fairly rapidly.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then on the large electric transmission projects, are you seeing a shift at all in that market towards more sequential small projects away from large lump sum projects?","James F. O'Neil","We are seeing our smaller project revenues ramp at the same pace as the large projects. So they're both very active right now or they have been. We continue to believe that the small transmission market will continue to grow for the next several years.","Derrick A. Jensen","Much of that work though still is lump sum work.","James F. O'Neil","That's right. Most of it is lump sum work and the visibility is limited in backlog and when projects will be awarded and move to construction. But it is a very active market right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann from Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Thanks for the color on the electric side you kind of gave and idea of what the average project size that you're working on today is. Just curious if you can give us some similar context like that for the pipeline stuff, obviously, not on what you're working on today, but on the large diameter stuff that you could be working and you're looking at bidding on today for the future, obviously excluding Keystone. Just give us some sense about what the opportunities that might be like.","James F. O'Neil","Andy, I'd rather stay away from that right now. I would say that we typically announce projects that are at $100 million or greater in size. And that's just a general rule that we've been applied the last -- over the last several years. But we really don't want to talk about any of these pipeline projects until we have a signed contract and a start date. And then we'll be glad to provide as much information and color as we're allowed to by the customer.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Fair response. I've figured I'd try. The balance sheet is still sitting with, as you mentioned, over $800 million of liquidity and still the cash from the telecom sale -- just as you think and strategically here, Jim, you haven't really commented on the M&A environment always part of what you do. And talk about the activity level there and maybe the potential or the size of deals that you're looking at here today, adjacencies to what you currently do, et cetera.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, this is Derrick, actually. The -- from a use of capital perspective, our obviously #1 in areas of focus continues to be working capital. When you use a -- just to the extent that the large project that Jim spoke about, there was a little demand, a fair amount of working capital. And so our #1 priority is to ensure we have plenty of working capital or cash availability to support the growth and then as well associated CapEx. But then, yes, acquisitions and our investments are next priority. From that, we continue to be quite active. We haven't had a material transaction closed in a bit. We did have a small transaction closed in the first quarter, recently, small transaction. But we're active, we're opportunistic and we don't have anything that we target from a size of an acquisition or a timing of an acquisition, but we continue to be quite active in the pursuit of those opportunities.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Mannes from Avondale.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First, just I want to focus a little bit more on Q1 as well on the electric side. Given that the -- as far as I can see, this is the strongest quarterly revenue you've ever put up and you put it up in the first quarter. But just wondering if there was any material impact either from maybe counter seasonal work in Canada? Or number two, was there any sort of post-Sandy work that maybe fell through in the first quarter that was maybe more or better than previously anticipated?","James F. O'Neil","Yes. I would say that there was probably limited post-Sandy work going into the first quarter. Most of that was completed in early December. The seasonal -- the performance in the first quarter, I think it's just good execution and good weather throughout the country. I mean, we've got a significant amount of activity going on in Texas. We'd have great production on CREZ, great production in California and other parts of the country. So it's just overall having good weather elements over the -- on average on 17 projects throughout North America and great execution. So we're very pleased with the results and then hopefully, we'll be able to continue that into the next few quarters and beyond.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","And then a quick follow-up on that. With some of the CREZ work winding down, I think some of it wound down in the first quarter in Lone Star and some of it maybe later in the year and then a big pickup in Canada. How mobile is your labor force in terms of project management? Or how do you manage that internally given pretty different geographies for this work?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean, that's one thing that I would say that we excel at is moving resources across the country to mobilize on opportunities that come to us. And we're not concerned at all right now. I mean we feel that we still have the ability to take on additional work even at today's level of activity, and we'll continue to pursue opportunities. If we can get the right margins in projects, we'll certainly pursue them in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noelle Dilts from Stifel.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First on looking at transition orders, I know a few folks have cited how strong they were. But if I strip out the Island Falls Key Lake project in Eastern Alberta, it actually looks like order is kind of outside of the identical -- identifiable projects over the past few quarters have slowed a bit, and that seems counter to what you're saying. So I'm just -- I want to know if that's attributable mostly just to lumpiness or if you have any thoughts on that?","James F. O'Neil","It's lumpy. I mean, and that's one thing we try to convey and communicate every quarter is that large project awards can be lumpy quarter-over-quarter, and you have to look at the long term. And we've continued to say that our Electric Segment backlog will remain strong going forward, and we do not see any fundamental changes in the drivers of transmission over the next year, and we'll continue to say that. So you can't get caught up in not seeing any awards in the quarter or if you get 3 or 4 awards in the quarter, it doesn't mean we're going to grow at 50% or 80% like we did last year either. So you just -- it's going to be strong going forward. And until we see otherwise, we'll continue to communicate that same message.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then secondly, I appreciated your comment when you talked about being disciplined on bidding on some of these larger pipeline projects. I'm just curious, as you -- I think we've seen a lot of smaller and large projects, but NGL-type products -- projects in the south that you don't really participate in, but some of your maybe more competitive, competitors do. So I was curious, have you seen some of that capacity tightened up? Are you starting to see more disciplined bidding on some of these jobs? Are you seeing just any change in how competitive that bidding is? And also we've heard quite a bit about a shift toward more negotiations away from competitive bid. And can you comment on if you're seeing that trend in the industry?","James F. O'Neil","I would say capacity in the industry is tight, and one of the big drivers is that a lot of the big pipe or mainline resources are mobilized in shales doing gathering work. We're going to continue to remain disciplined in bidding and only pursue opportunities where we believe we have the right margins in projects to mitigate the risk of doing those jobs. And I don't see -- I think that as far as negotiated work and so forth, I would just say that we're not seeing that right now. It's the traditional bidding environment, but probably with only the players that customers have the comfort that they've got the capacity to carry out the capital programs in the future because it is a tight market.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from Craig Irwin from Wedbush.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just a housekeeping question. I noticed you bumped your CapEx guidance for the year. Can you comment about whether this is due to limited availability of equipment out of the rental houses. Maybe if there's something specific that had you increase your capital requirements for the year, if this is maybe something for gas or electric power or if this is just due to greater project activity possibly in the back end of the year or next year?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, this is Derrick. Actually, it's really none of those. It's us moving forward on the development of a training facility. We've committed this year to put forward some, obviously, $10 million to $15 million for the development of a training facility, which will be used for both pipeline group and our electric power group, which we think provides us a much more steady and reliable location to provide that training to our employees. And at the same time, we ultimately think it will reduce our cash, out-of-pocket costs associated with any of that training.","Operator","There appears to be no further questions. Please continue with any other points you wish to raise.","James F. O'Neil","I'd like to thank you all for participating in our first quarter 2013 conference call.

Jim?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you, Kip, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services' second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I will start the call with an operational overview, before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our second quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we will welcome your questions.","In light of the challenges we are facing in 2015, I think it is important to provide a few key takeaways, before I get into my usual quarterly commentary.","First, we are disappointed in our second quarter performance, and the project issues we have experienced have been addressed.","Second, the downward revision to our forecast in the second half of this year is largely driven by a change in the electric transmission project dynamics, which I will discuss in detail this morning.","And third, and most important, our confidence in our 2016 and beyond outlook and the stability of our industry fundamentals remains intact. Our end market outlook is positive, and we remain confident in our leadership position in those markets. As a management team, we are resolved to create shareholder value over the long term.","Now for a review of our second quarter performance: Revenues in the second quarter (04:04) as compared to last year's second quarter, however, our earnings per share came in well below our expectations. There were several key factors that led to our earnings shortfall in the second quarter. In our Electric Power segment, I will first discuss the Island Falls to Key Lake electric transmission project for SaskPower that we have been working on since 2013. This project is in the remote areas of northern Saskatchewan with little or no terrestrial access to the project right-of-way, and to date has been a very challenging project. Most of the work we are performing requires helicopter support to access this project.","Production on this project was affected in the first half of this year by extreme weather conditions. Toward the end of June, this project was further impacted by work stoppage requirements due to the forest fires in the province. The project was 95% complete and three weeks away from finishing when the work stoppage occurred. As a result, we demobilized project crews and have just recently released to return to work. This delay has increased the overall cost to complete this job.","Second, we experienced delays accessing right-of-way on Nalcor's Labrador Island Link HVdc transmission project because land clearing operations were moving slower than anticipated following the Canadian breakup season. In order to maximize our production we had to scale back our construction activities in the quarter, which resulted in a reduction in our previously forecasted project revenues but did not impact our overall margin profile on the project. The land clearing issues have been resolved but will impact our project schedule going forward.","Third, we continue to have issues with our combined cycle power plant project in Alaska where we are the EPC provider. As you may recall in the first quarter, we discussed critical material delays on this project. Since then, engineering issues emerged creating additional scope and subsequent higher project cost, and as a result, we are now recording the project at a loss for its duration. We estimate the project is 68% complete and expect to finish the project in the middle of next year. We accrued all remaining losses on the project in the second quarter.","And finally, our Electric Power segment was adversely impacted by record rainfall in many of our service areas, which primarily impacted transmission and distribution services for our customers. Our Oil and Gas segment also experienced challenges in the quarter. We experienced cost overruns on a large gas distribution fixed-cost project in Ontario. This project is now back on track and is scheduled to complete by year-end.","We also experienced record rainfall impacting several of our pipeline and facility projects throughout the Lower 48. For example, our Line 78, mainline construction project for Enbridge is in the states of Illinois and Indiana, which received record 100 year rainfall amounts in the month of June, which significantly impacted our production.","Now I will turn my commentary to our full-year guidance. We have reduced our 2015 guidance to reflect our second quarter results which I have just discussed and other factors that we expect to impact the remainder of this year.","In our Electric Power segment, several events have developed that impact our Electric Power transmission forecast. First, project revenues for at least two customers are being deferred from the second half of this year into 2016. This includes approximately $110 million in revenue from the Nalcor's Labrador Island Link project for reasons I discussed previously. It also includes the impact of regulatory delays on certain projects in the Northeast region of the United States, resulting in approximately $80 million in revenues that we now expect to be generated in 2016 rather than the end of this year. Worth noting, the margins on these projects have not been impacted by the delays.","Second, this year, there has been and will continue to be a significant amount of electric transmission project bidding activity. In our prior forecasts, using a methodology consistent with our historical approach to guidance, we estimated a certain level of uncommitted electric transmission revenues that we anticipated would be awarded to Quanta and moved to construction this year.","Our most recent forecast indicates that we will have a $300 million shortfall in Electric Power transmission projects for the remainder of this year compared to our prior estimate. There are two primary reasons for this shortfall. The first, our success rate on winning transmission projects over the last two months has been below our expectations due to more aggressive regional competition. The second is that several transmission projects originally scheduled to bid and move to construction this year have been delayed. However, the pipeline of electric transmission programs remains robust. And over the next three years, we are currently tracking large transmission projects with an estimated aggregate contract value of up to $12 billion.","As we have stated in the past, the timing of large project awards can be lumpy, and some projects can experience intermittent starts and stops during construction. As a result, forecasting these dynamics is very difficult over a discrete quarterly or calendar year period and can occasionally impact our results and future expectations. These dynamics have not meaningfully impacted our results historically, but have this year.","However, our positive sentiment toward electric transmission is unchanged, and we continue to believe there are growth opportunities for our Electric segment over a multi-year period. In addition to active large electric transmission programs bidding activity, we are experiencing solid growth from our subtransmission projects and also for our electric distribution services.","In our Oil and Gas segment, our revenue expectations for the remainder of this year have also been reduced. We are experiencing delays on two mainline projects in backlog that will not commence construction in the fourth quarter as expected. These projects will more than likely start in the first half of 2016.","Also, a major natural gas distribution pipeline replacement program in Canada was delayed from the second half of this year into next year. In total, we moved approximately $175 million of revenue from the current year to 2016. All of these projects have been delayed due to a longer than anticipated permitting and siting process.","We have also seen a reduction of approximately $50 million related to services we provide to our oil and gas customers in Canada, who continue to moderate CapEx due to lower price of oil. And, to a lesser extent, we have experienced similar impacts in the Lower 48.","We've previously stated that the lower oil price environment had an impact to our overall consolidated revenues by about 5% to 10% since the beginning of this year. However, we now believe the impact could be on the high end of that range due to the ongoing challenges in both Western Canada and in the Lower 48.","We expect an acceleration of mainline pipe activity in 2016. The Oil and Gas segment has been building backlog momentum with recent sizable pipeline project wins such as Line 78 mainline project for Enbridge and our previously announced selection by the SemGroup for the Maurepas Pipeline Project.","In addition, as announced in our earnings release this morning, in the second quarter, Enbridge pipeline selected our Canadian subsidiary, Banister Pipelines Construction, a Quanta Services company, for Package A of the Norlite Pipeline Project. This project includes the installation of approximately 197 kilometers of up to 24 inch diameter pipeline from the Enbridge Stonefell site to the Suncor East Tank farm near Fort McMurray.","Construction is expected to commence later this year and scheduled completion is in the spring of 2017. This project was awarded and booked in backlog as of June 30. The revenues generated from this project in 2015 will be minimal. The aggregate contract value for these three projects is close to $1 billion and we expect the majority of these revenues from these projects to be generated in 2016.","In addition, we are very close to finalizing several large mainline pipe agreements with customers. As such, we are incrementally more confident in Quanta's mainline pipe project opportunities over the next several years and believe demand for our mainline construction and EPC services will ramp upwards during the next several years. We believe it is possible that our mainline construction resources will be at high utilization levels as we enter the second half of 2016.","It is also important to note that in the second half of the year, we are forecasting a reduction to our consolidated operating margins. This is due to several factors. I previously described the project delays impacting our Electric Power transmission business for the remainder of this year.","Approximately $500 million of electric transmission revenues of which $200 million is in backlog will not materialize this year. While we have had offset some of this decline in revenues with new electric power and gas distribution contracts, the overall gross margin impact is by far most significant contributor to our margin decline.","Second, similar to our electric delays, as discussed previously, we have approximately $175 million in pipeline projects in backlog where construction has been delayed from 2015 into next year. In total, we have approximately $375 million in projects in backlog, that for the most part, are experienced delays in permitting and siting of right-of-way. Furthermore, our G&A structure has not been adjusted to reflect the recent delays in project activity largely because we believe any downturn in our business will be short-term in nature.","Next, in the Lower 48, whether has affected production on some projects, particularly on our mainline pipe and facility services. As a result, we will experience increased cost on some of these projects going forward in order to meet completion deadlines.","And finally, we continue to see pressures on our pipeline construction operations in Western Canada, the Gulf of Mexico, and Australia due to low oil prices. The combination of these factors has the result of unfavorably impacting our operating margins for the remainder of this year.","In summary, we are disappointed with our 2015 results. Despite our performance, our end market outlook remains positive over a multi-year period. The North American power grid is aging and reliability challenges are increasing. There are regulations in effect to encourage T&D spending, the North America generation mix continues to shift away from coal to more natural gas and renewables, and new technologies are being implemented for a more advanced power grid, all of which require grid expansions and enhancements.","While the nature and the timing of these projects may vary from time to time, results in uneven growth on a calendar year basis like we are experiencing in 2015, solving the North America power grid challenges could take decades and require more than $1 trillion of investment.","Going forward, we remain confident in opportunities for profitable growth in all aspects of our business. The underlying drivers of our business remain intact. We remain steadfast in our focus and confidence in our ability to execute and deliver customer-driven solutions that have made us the industry leader that we are today.","Confirming the confidence in our business, this morning we announced that Quanta's Board of Directors has approved a new $1.25 billion share repurchase program. This is by far the largest share repurchase authorization in Quanta's history. This action reflects our commitment to creating shareholder value and our ongoing confidence in the longer-term outlook for our business.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his financial review results. Thank you. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the results of the quarter, I'll comment that yesterday we closed the sale of our fiber optic licensing operations and we have presented these as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for the current and prior periods. As such, the amounts presented in our earnings release and discussed in my comments this morning do not compare to our previous SEC filing, which have not yet been adjusted to reflect these discontinued operations. However, for comparative purposes, we have posted certain prior period information on our website reflecting these discontinued operations. I will discuss the impact of the closing of the transaction later in my presentation.","Today we announced revenues of $1.87 billion for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $1.84 billion in the prior-year second quarter, reflecting an increase of 1.9% in quarter-over-quarter revenues. Net income attributable to common stock for the quarter was $46.1 million or $0.22 per diluted share which for the purpose of this earnings call is the number most comparable to our previously provided quarterly GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance. This compares to $81.1 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share from net income attributable to common stock, as presented in today's press release, is also the most comparative to our previous quarterly guidance and was $0.26 for the second quarter of 2015 as compared to $0.42 for the second quarter of 2014.","Although Jim has highlighted various impacts to the quarter, I'll provide some additional commentary before discussing the detailed financial review. This quarter we had three major projects which were impacted by an aggregate of $32 million in losses, due to increased project cost associated with various items impacting production. We have included an estimate for change orders that are deemed probable of collection in our results for the quarter but we are currently evaluating additional aspects of these project circumstances which we believe warrant recovery through change orders or claims that may be pursued in subsequent periods.","Our results for the quarter were also impacted by lower overall reported revenues versus our expectations with a corresponding adverse impact on gross profit, driven largely by delays associated with the Labrador Island Link project that Jim mentioned in his comments, which resulted in a shortfall of roughly $50 million in revenues. In addition, significant rainfall during the quarter across a number of our operating areas impacted production on numerous projects, resulting in margins lower than our expectations.","Turning to a broader discussion of our results. The increase in consolidated revenues in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to the same quarter last year was primarily due to an 11% increase in revenues from our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment, partially offset by a 2.4% decrease in revenues from our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.","Quantifying an estimated impact of changes in foreign exchange rates between the quarters, consolidated revenues and earnings were negatively impacted by approximately 2.5% when compared to the second quarter of last year. Our consolidated gross margin was 12.2% in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to 14.4% in the second quarter of 2014 as a result of the negative operational impacts I described previously.","Selling, general and administrative expenses as presented in this quarter's earnings release were $149.9 million in the second quarter of 2015, reflecting an increase of $14.7 million as compared to the prior year's second quarter. This increase was primarily due to $7.4 million in incremental G&A costs associated with acquired companies and approximately $7.3 million in higher salaries and benefits costs associated with additional personnel and cost of living increases.","Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 8% in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to 7.4% in the second quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to slightly higher cost structures of the companies acquired after the second quarter of last year, the impact of annual compensation increases coupled with the lower ratio of Canadian operations with certain units having lower selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues than other of our operations.","To further discuss our segment results, Electric Power revenues were $1.22 billion, reflecting a decrease of $30.5 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 2.4%. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenues in the segment by 2.3%, which was offset by the contribution of approximately $20 million in revenues from companies acquired since the second quarter of last year and an increase in emergency restoration revenues of approximately $6.5 million to $23 million for the second quarter of 2015.","Revenues were otherwise negatively impacted by the timing of electric transmission projects and certain larger projects that were ongoing in last year's second quarter reached or neared completion in the second quarter of this year.","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment decreased to 7.2% in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to 9% in last year's second quarter. Roughly, $25 million of the project losses I referenced earlier are applicable to projects in this segment, which accounts for all of the quarter-over-quarter decline. Significant weather events impacted both the second quarter of this year and last year such that the margin in this segment was otherwise comparable.","As of June 30, 2015, 12-month and total backlog for the Electric Power segment decreased by 0.5% and 2.5% when compared to March 31, 2015, due to the expected levels of the roll-off from certain master service agreements, which were not replaced by expected projects. And as Jim commented, we continue to see the opportunity for additional awards, although they may not contribute to sequential backlog growth.","Oil and Gas segment revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by $64.6 million or 11% to $650 million in 2Q 2015. This increase was the result of revenue contributions of approximately $50 million from companies acquired since the second quarter of last year as well as increased revenue from mainline pipe activity ramping up from previously awarded projects, partially offset by reduced demand for services due to lower oil prices and associated impacts in customer spending.","Revenues in the second quarter of 2015, as compared to the second quarter of 2014, are also estimated to have been negatively impacted by approximately $17 million as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","Operating income for the Oil and Gas segment as a percentage of revenues decreased to 5.5% in 2Q 2015 from 9.5% in 2Q 2014. Approximately $7 million of the previously discussed project losses relate to this segment. In addition, multiple other projects in this segment were impacted by heavy rainfall during the quarter as compared to projects in last year's second quarter and certain of our operations within this segment were adversely impacted by lower customer demand associated with lower oil prices, which resulted in decreased ability to cover fixed costs.","Twelve-month backlog for the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment decreased by $157 million, or 8.4%, when compared to March 31, 2015. However, beyond 12-month backlog increased by $348.3 million at June 30 when compared to the first quarter, resulting in an overall 7.1% increase in total backlog for this segment which currently sits at record levels.","Twelve-month backlog decreases are primarily associated with the burn on existing projects and reduced spending on master service agreements compared to historical levels as replacement projects reflect the timing of award start dates into later periods. Project awards during the second quarter include the Columbia Pipeline Group project award that we announced in our first quarter earnings call as well as the Enbridge Norlite Pipeline project that Jim mentioned in his earlier comments.","Corporate and un-allocated costs increased $7.5 million in the second quarter 2015 as compared to 2Q 2014 primarily as a result of $3.7 million in higher salaries and benefits cost due to increased personnel to support strategic initiatives, as well as cost of living increases and $1.4 million in higher costs associated with ongoing technology and business development initiatives.","EBITA for the second quarter of 2015 was $74 million or 4% of revenues compared to $123.7 million or 6.7% of revenues for the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA was $126.9 million, or 6.8% of revenues for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $168.8 million or 9.2% of revenues for the second quarter of 2014.","The calculation of EBITA, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are all non-GAAP measures and the definitions of these and days sales outstanding, or DSO, can be found in the Investors and Media section of our website at quantaservices.com.","For the second quarter of 2015, cash flow provided by operations was approximately $106 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $55 million, resulting in approximately $51 million of free cash flow as compared to negative free cash flow of approximately $42 million for the second quarter of 2014. Prior year's free cash flow was negatively impacted by the timing of projects and certain electric power transmission projects are ramping up during the three months ended June 30, 2014, which resulted in an increase in working capital requirements during the period. While the current quarter's level of operations and working capital requirements were generally more consistent with the first quarter of 2015.","In addition, a $28 million arbitration payment was made in the second quarter of 2014 for the settlement of an earlier contracted dispute on a 2010 directional drilling project. Cash flows from operations for the six-month ended June 30, 2015, provided approximately $286 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $112 million, resulting in approximately $174 million of free cash flow as compared to negative free cash flow of $171 million for the six-month ended June 30, 2014.","DSOs were 85 days at June 30, 2015, compared to 84 days at December 31, 2014, and 78 days at June 30, 2014. DSOs were higher at June 30, 2015 primarily due to the timing of certain billing milestones as well as closeout and final retainers billings on certain projects that were near completion.","Investing cash flows during the second quarter of 2015 were impacted by aggregate cash consideration paid of approximately $37.9 million net of cash acquired related to the closing of three acquisitions during the quarter. Financing cash flows during the second quarter of 2015 were impacted by the repurchase of 5.8 million shares of our common stock for approximately $172.3 million, partially offset by net borrowings of $96.5 million under our credit facility.","At June 30, 2015, we had approximately $65.4 million in cash. At the end of the quarter, we had about $324.7 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments, and we had $204.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $900 million in total liquidity as of June 30, 2015.","Although for our second quarter results, I spoke to net income attributable to common stock, in order to discuss the result most comparable to our last quarter guidance, for our outlook on an ongoing basis, except where noted, I will speak to continuing operations.","Concerning our outlook for 2015, we expect the revenues for the third quarter of 2015 to range between $1.9 billion and $2 billion and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be $0.34 to $0.40 on a GAAP basis. These estimates compare to revenues of $2.15 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.40 in the third quarter of 2014. Included within the prior year's third quarter is the impact of a $52.5 million pre-tax charge, or $0.15 per diluted share, to provision for long-term contract receivable associated with an Electric Power Infrastructure Services project completed in 2012, as well as $4.9 million of income, or $0.02 per diluted share, from the release of income tax contingencies.","Our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2015 is expected to be $0.40 to $0.46 when compared to our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.58 in the third quarter of 2014.","On an annual basis, we expect revenues to range between $7.5 billion and $7.7 billion, and we currently anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.05 to $1.20. We anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.32 to $1.47. Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release.","As a result of the project changes Jim referred to, at the mid-point of our guidance for the year, we see Electric Power revenue showing approximately a 6% to 8% decline as compared to 2014. We are concurrently estimated operating margin for the year to be approximately 9% in the Electric Power segment, which reflects $40 million of first and second quarter losses from the projects discussed earlier as well as the six months to date impacts of substantial precipitation events.","Also, much of the decrease in our annual expectation is specifically attributable to our Canadian results. When considering only U.S. electric power operations and removing the impact of the project loss from the power plant project on this portion of the segment, margins are expected to remain in the 10% to 11% annual range previously anticipated. For the Oil and Gas segment, the midpoint of our annual guidance assumes revenue growth in the high-single digits when compared to 2014.","As Jim commented, the anticipated start dates for several projects have experienced delays, and oil price uncertainty has created incremental softness in demand for certain of our services. And when considering the first half results for the segment, our annual margin expectations for the segment are between 7% and 8%.","Since our JV relationships are winding down, we expect no non-controlling interest deductions in the latter half of 2015. We are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for the third and fourth quarters to be between 37% and 38%. We currently estimate our diluted share count to be about 207 million shares for the remaining quarters of the year and 211 million shares for the year in total.","I'll discuss our new repurchase program in a moment, but I'll comment that our projected year-end share count does not include any repurchases from now to the end of the year. Also, both the third quarter and annual 2015 guidance reflect the current foreign exchange rate environment. Continued movement of foreign exchange rates in the future could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and actuals differ from guidance.","We expect CapEx for all of 2015 to be approximately $225 million to $255 million, when factoring in 2015 to date acquisitions. This compares to CapEx for all of 2014 of $247.2 million. As announced yesterday, we finalized the closing of our fiber optic licensing operations and received proceeds of approximately $1 billion. This will result in a net gain from the transaction to be recorded in the third quarter of 2015 of approximately $175 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, which will be included in our results from discontinued operations.","We currently estimate the net proceeds from the transaction to be approximately $830 million. As we stated when we announced the transaction, it was our intent to utilize the proceeds in a way we felt would create incremental value to our shareholders. This morning, we announced that our board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to $1.25 billion in shares of our common stock over an 18-month program.","We also announced our intent to enter into an accelerated stock repurchase arrangement to facilitate the repurchase of $750 million of our stock. Once executed, the ASR arrangement would require that we fund 100% of the arrangement in exchange for immediate delivery and retirement of approximately 80% of the expected total share repurchase with the remaining 20% to be settled over the next seven months to eight months of the arrangement.","In addition, the accelerated stock repurchase can be supplemented with $500 million in open market repurchases. This expanded program comes on top of the announcement today that we recently completed our previously repurchase program having repurchased approximately 7.6 million shares of our common stock since the first quarter of 2015 for approximately $224 million. This brings our combined year-to-date 2015 stock repurchases to 14.4 million shares for total investment of $406 million.","The combination of these stock repurchase efforts, not only shows our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, it more than eliminates any dilution associated with the disposition of our fiber optic licensing operation and illustrates our commitment and belief in the long-term value of our customer.","If one were to assume the full deployment of capital against the new repurchase program, looking at our June 30 balance sheet, our leverage profile would be around one turn of debt. Considering our outstanding letters of credit against our credit facility, our need for working capital flexibility to support the long-term growth potential we continue to observe, our bonding requirements, as well as continued opportunistic M&A and investment opportunities, we feel this is an appropriate move toward revising the capital structure of our company.","This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Your first question will come from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, folks.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning, Tahira.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","First question is really in regards to outlook, Jim, you still remain pretty positive. I guess for me the question is that you've always seen delays and hiccups on the regulatory side in the past, is there a reason that they are taking so much of a toll this year in particular? Has something changed and perhaps you're doing more work in Canada and that's added a new dimension it seems, or perhaps you've just reached a critical mass where delays are really \u2013 you're much more sensitive to that on the growth side?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, Tahira, I think, there's several factors that come into play. One, projects are getting bigger and they're getting longer in mileage, they're getting higher in voltage, which means they are more unsightly and they're in more populated areas. We've had a lot of our work move to the Northeast U.S. and Eastern Canada and the regulatory delays in sitings becomes a little bit more challenging.","In the last four years, we've had a pretty steady amount of projects coming in. Now we are seeing bigger projects and there's going to be more gaps in awards because of the permitting and siting process and because of the sheer size of these projects.","So, the outlook and the dollars of opportunities has not changed. In fact, it's as large as we've seen; it's just the timing of these awards coming out. It just creates some lulls in activity and we're seeing some of that now. We experienced some of that over the last four years.","We always had a project or two in delay but nobody could really see that from the investment community, because we had other projects going very well. Here, it's just a perfect storm and we see a gap that's occurring but it doesn't change our outlook for the business over a multi-year period.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it, Jim. And as a follow-up, to that, given you're seeing more delays, more lumpy large projects, clearly the buyback will help signal to people your confidence but obviously backlog growth will as well. How do feel given the scenarios you're seeing on the macro side right now and the possibility of some of these projects hitting by the end of the year, so people feel more comfortable about the next year?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, I don't think you're going to see any of these projects that are not in backlog today or any projects or awards that we may receive by the end of the year will be meaningful to the 2015 revenues.","We do anticipate that there will be some projects \u2013 there are some big projects right now that are in the bidding process that certainly we could have announcements over the next few months, but certainly can't predict the timing of when projects are going to be awarded and when they move to construction because both of those factors are driven by the siting and permitting process. Our customers aren't going to move to bidding and awards, in many cases, until they've buttoned down a lot of the regulatory hurdles that they have to get through.","Operator","And your next question will come from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. I guess two questions. The first question, Derrick, the question that I'm getting from investors is broadly how to think about 2016 and I know you don't want to give guidance, but if you could just walk us through the puts and takes of how we should think about the base of earnings, because you look at it and you don't have the weather issues next year.","I assume you'll have the $375 million of revenue that was for 2015 that gets pushed into 2016. We have the ASR. I'm just trying to think of the puts and takes because I think 2016 broadly is critical in particular given the execution that we've had in 2015. And then I guess just my second question relates to \u2013 I'm sorry, the second questions relates to \u2013 are you guys still there?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","We're here, Jamie.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Sorry, guys. Someone else was dialing in. Why don't you do the first question and then actually I have a follow-up?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Sure, I'll start a little bit and then Jim can color from the operational side. The project losses that have been recorded in the first six months of this year accumulate to about $47 million.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","And so what I would say is that we would obviously not be anticipating that that type of impact would be occurring in the future. So that would be one reconciling item. And then you asked from the ASR perspective, as an example. I mean, the ASR and the stock repurchase of the $1.25 billion, we would anticipate to be moving forward with some sort of ASR shortly. I'll comment that we have not executed that yet, but we are in the process of negotiating the aspects of the contract currently.","Very real-time and so we would anticipate that, that would be moving \u2013 something we'd be moving forward with shortly. That being the case and that would be the $750 million reduction in the overall outstanding shares of the company so that also would be contributing directly to 2016. The way that we would look at that is that, 80% of that will be immediately removed, 80% of that $750 million would immediately reduce the share count with the remaining 20% to be brought back at the end of that contract which we would anticipate to be at the 7 month or 8 month timeframe.","So I would say the vast majority of that would be taken out of the share count by the early part of 2016. I think those two things combined would show you that it's fairly easy to see an aspect of double-digit growth for certain when you're looking at 2015 versus 2016. Does that help color that?","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, that helps. And I guess my second question is just sort of been, Derrick and Jim, you and I have gone back and forth on this. Given some of the issues over the past five quarters, six quarters, given the magnitude of the issues we saw in this quarter, have you gone back and sort of scrubbed your backlog and how would you \u2013 how should we think about the quality of the backlog, the three or four projects that you talked about because obviously there's a concern that there's something bigger, that there's something bigger going on here? And then the second question is, were any of these issues big enough where you've made internal changes or management changes? Thanks.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. Jamie. We go through backlog in great detail every quarter and I think the bigger issue on backlog is whether it's in 12 months or pushed out of 12 months. But I mean the projects \u2013 there hadn't been any change in backlog as far as any of these pushes and pulls that have occurred. We've had projects in backlog and they pushed from this calendar period into the next and the projects that didn't materialize that were uncommitted weren't in our backlog.","With that said, too, we have made some management changes. I mean, really, the only area that we really had execution issues due to management is on that power plant in Alaska. And we made some whole \u2013 wholesale changes there. The Phoenix power acquisition that we did, we put that management team on top of that. It was a timely acquisition and those guys are really doing a good job in rightsizing and in getting that project back on track.","We'd made that change about six months ago and that's where we \u2013 once they got in and dug in, we were able to uncover some of these other issues in this quarter. Other than that, most of the other issues that we have, have been driven by weather delays or issues like the fire where we've just had cost overruns. And some of these projects, we are seeking some level of recovery as well that isn't recognized in the quarter.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All rightie. Thank you. That's helpful. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","From UBS, we'll hear from Steven Fisher.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. You discussed the oil and gas projects in backlog moving from the second half of this year, the first half of next year. How does that affect the execution risk around those projects? It doesn't sound like they're in Canada but I don't know if there's any particular weather risk there and what's your confidence in those actually moving forward in the first half? What has to happen for those to actually move forward?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Steve, one of the projects is Lake Maurepas project in Louisiana so actually, the move into the first quarter of next year really is not significant from a weather impact standpoint. The project's going to take over a year to build anyway, so the big risk in that project is any type of hurricane or storm during storm season and that hasn't been avoided by this move, because the project's going to take a calendar year to build. So we're fine there. The other project I can't discuss. It's under one of our MSAs that we have. And we're not allowed to disclose it by the customer, but I will tell you that the contractual relationship on that job is one where if the project did get moved into a weather prone period that there would certainly be the ability to price that risk into the job. So we're not held to a firm price because the job \u2013 and we're taking additional risk because the job has moved into a more adverse weather potential period if that makes sense.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","But you are confident that those projects are actually going to go forward in the first half?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","I am confident that those projects are going to go forward. Okay. I do believe that they'll go in the first half of the year, but again, I got to caveat all of this. I mean we're coming off of a time where we've moved our forecast the second half of the year. These are big projects, again, that are subject to delays but I think those two projects are very much through the permitting and siting hurdles, that they've only got one or two things to clear and I think I'm fairly confident they'll start in the first quarter of next year. Pipe is ordered on those jobs and that's a good sign as well. The customers putting more CapEx forward on those projects, which gives you confidence that they're going to go forward as well.","Operator","From Avondale Partners, we'll go to Dan Mannes.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning, Dan.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Just to follow up on some of your commentary on, I guess, on the pipeline bidding and on timing. You made the comment that the developers are waiting until things are buttoned up before awarding, but, I mean, we're seeing a tremendous amount of bidding right now on pipeline for stuff that doesn't break ground even until mid-next year. In some cases, FERC filings are only a couple months in.","I guess the worry I have is we're going to see a slate of backlog this year but then we're going to be sitting here next year at this time and going through a similar circumstances as it relates to timing. So can you maybe help us out a little bit with your expectations for all the stuff you're looking at right now and how confident you are that stuff will actually move forward in a timely basis?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, I'll put it this way. I feel like pipeline is very similar to where we were sitting with electric transmission back at the end of 2010. And there's going to be so much coming that, yeah, you're going to have one or two projects or three projects in regulatory delays but there's so much work there that it's going to make a meaningful impact to the company.","Now, whether that ramps up in the middle of 2016 or toward the end of 2016 or \u2013 but it's going to ramp. And there's a pent-up demand for mainline pipe, specifically takeaway capacity to move natural gas and to move LNG in Canada.","I mean there's a significant amount of projects out there that we've got $1 billion we talked about on the call today. I'll tell you right now that we're very close on another billion that hopefully we'll be announcing soon. And there's just a significant amount of work to where projects have to move forward. Even if half of them move forward, it would be a significant contribution to the company.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Got it. In the follow-on on the electric side, you mentioned maybe some \u2013 a lower win rate more recently on some transmission. Are you referring to kind of the competitive solicitations like what we saw in California for (50:43) or are you saying more broadly, and can you maybe account for some of the changes in the competitive environment?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","The competitive environment hasn't changed. We're going to have times where you're going to have competitors come in and take projects cheaply and we're going to keep our bidding discipline. We're not going to chase revenues for the sake of revenues. We could have done that here but we didn't.","We risk-weight our pipeline of opportunities on non-committed. A couple of the non-awards to us were surprising because we did think we were in the driver's seat, but that happens all the time to some extent.","We did see a couple of regional players that really probably aren't well-known in this space, but they've been around for decades. The KCP&L job, that's right in our backyard, but we've got a local competitor there that we didn't feel had the capabilities to do that job that big and I still don't think they do, but we'll see how that plays out.","But it happens. We're not going to win every job and we're going to hold our bidding discipline, but I wouldn't say that the competitive dynamics have changed. I think that as these jobs get bigger and higher voltage, when you get into these 500-kV DC type lines, you're going to have fewer people that have capabilities to do that, so that bodes well for us. It will eliminate some of these regional guys.","Operator","And our next question will come from William Bremer with Maxim Group.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Good morning, Jim.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning, Bill.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Maybe just an update what's happening in Canada and in Australia, a little bit there. And some of the utilities have actually called out some positives in terms of integrity and just maybe talk about the MSAs there if that's been picking up on your end.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Look Bill, Integrity is still a very bright area for us. We've been building our business out. In fact, we've expanded into two new utilities over the last 90 days on bringing our pipeline rehabilitation program to these customers and using our utility technology.","It's a core service that we offer. We offer a broader solution I think than others with our program management engineering capabilities, our ability to dispatch on a national basis and in Canada, our pipeline rehabilitation crews as well as our technology and it's a growth area for us. And I've seen that business grow near double-digit clips here for the last several years and I don't see that business \u2013 the trends in that business changing anytime soon.","Australia, certainly, the focus there has been big pipe. We all are trying to launch some Integrity capabilities there. But that's off of a very small \u2013 smaller base. We're starting at ground zero. But Australia's a great opportunity. We continue to see an opportunity for electric \u2013 to do a consolidation of electric capabilities in Australia, because they've got the same issues that we have here in the U.S., an aging grid that's not built to serve the population centers that they have today. They have load growth issues in most of the metropolitan areas there, and they need significant assistance from a contractor that has the balance sheet capabilities to help them.","So \u2013 but that's going to take time to play out. It's not going to play out overnight. It's a five-year to seven-year strategy, but we feel we're in early enough to really establish our presence and grow with that market once it begins to accelerate.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","And Canada?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, Canada on Integrity, that's a huge opportunity. We made an acquisition, CUC there, there's significant opportunity in B.C. We bought A&B in Calgary and certainly one of their primary focuses right now is Integrity and pipeline rehabilitation. And we're deploying our Microline technologies into Canada for them to augment their services and provide a differentiation there from their competition.","So it's a big opportunity. Again, it's growing off a smaller base, but it's certainly, to us, one of the bigger growth areas that we see on a year-over-year basis for a multi-year period than any of our other services.","Operator","From Robert W. Baird & Company, we'll move on to Andy Wittmann.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. I wanted to dig in on the electric side since it seems like that was maybe the area with the biggest change in the quarter. I guess, maybe \u2013 I think we've talked about the pipeline bidding environment for projects and what your expectations are for the near and the long-term.","But, Jim, can you talk a little bit about the pace of bidding that you're seeing today and the potential for announcements even if they don't contribute earnings this calendar year, but what they could mean for the backlog direction and what you're seeing there?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. I mean the pace of bidding is very active. But when you get to these larger projects, you're back and forth for six months, nine months. You're going back to the customer multiple times. It's become a more complicated process than what it used to be, three or four years ago where you would submit a bid 60 days before a project or 30 days before a project and the customer would review them, they'd call you in, they would talk to you about the technical aspects of it and then the job would be awarded.","Now there's back and forth, back and forth, it's \u2013 and it's because the jobs are becoming larger and more complex. And we're trying to take on a bigger role too and not just provide engineering services but provide engineering capabilities like we did in Alberta for the Westmac [Fort McMurray West] (57:11) line. So the bidding activity's very strong, but it's different than what it was three years or four years ago. It's just a different process. But the underlying galactic business is intact and \u2013 but we're going to see some growing lumpiness, I think, as the HVdc is causing this type of dynamic in the short term.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. All right. On the earnings side of that, Jim, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks a $500 million revenue that you previously expected aren't going to happen probably this year, if that means that they're going to go next year. Does that mean that 2016 is a double-up year for some of these things or do you feel like the delays in the permitting that are happening is kind of normal course of business, the way things that were previously expected for 2016 and push those into 2017? In other words, what do the ramp potential look like with these delays? Is it all added to 2016 or does it kind of just smooth out the build cycle here?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, let me characterize the $500 million for you first. About $200 million of that, of the $500 million, is in backlog and part of that's the Nalcor program which is really just because we're not able to get the right-of-way access quickly, we've had to scale down our crews to about half to what they were just to keep efficiency and continue to make the margin profile that we expected.","So that work just naturally gets deferred into next year and into 2017. When you push stuff into 2016, it's going to come out of 2017. So 2016 really doesn't change, the project just delays into 2017 \u2013 on that project.","We had some deferrals in the Northeast with customers that we have MSA agreements to do transmission, due to regulatory and that was about $80 million, $90 million so that's going to go at some point next year. We lost $110 million to competition in our forecast, so that goes away. That doesn't move. So out of the $500 million, it's really $400 million.","And then there's the big piece of that is there's about $300 million in uncommitted that didn't materialize this year. That got pushed and most of that push was regulatory. So those are projects that were on our radar, that we were either in some form of discussion with the customer about negotiating or bidding, that the projects were originally intended to start in the third and fourth quarter this year, but now they've been pushed into the first quarter next year.","Do those projects get pushed further or not? I'm not going to even venture to guess that after what's just occurred. But they're there and it's part of the pent-up \u2013 part of the bullishness we have in the overall transmission business over a multi-year period.","Operator","From FBR, we'll hear from Alex Rygiel.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thanks, Jim and Derrick. First, I want to congratulate you on the Sunesys sale -","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","...and complement you on the buyback announcement. I think that's a great use of capital.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Alex.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Derrick, real quick, could you come back and update us on what the timeline of when you can be in the market buying back stock is again and I have a follow-up.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. I mean, we typically have a lag between what we would do \u2013 to let information disseminate publicly, so we would be able to be back in the market sometime at the end of this week or the early part of next week, assuming that we have no material non-public information.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And then, Jim, thinking from a macro standpoint, with regards to delays, are you seeing any of your customers \u2013 and maybe you need to break it out between electrical and gas \u2013 but are you seeing any of your customers delay or cancel projects due to broader market dynamics like the price of oil or anything else?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","We've seen that to some extent in Canada where we've had electrification in the shale fields to where we provide services to electrify some of those fields. It wasn't a meaningful part of our business, but it's certainly in that 5% to 10% impact that we've taken or we analyzed the 10% impact to our business because of the low price of oil.","Many of these projects, what we will have to be careful with when we evaluate these projects is some of them will compete with one another. And so the independent system operator is going to only pick one of three candidates. And we vet that out in our pipeline of opportunities.","We can't sit there and say there is three $500-million projects going in a certain region of the U.S., and they're all competing for each other. We don't count that as a $1.5 billion opportunity. We count that as a $500 million opportunity because one of these projects is likely to go.","But that's probably where we need to be the most prudent, when we look at our pipeline of opportunities, is those competing lines and to make sure that we don't double count. And that's an art more than a science because one and a half lines might go or the ISO might come up with a different option and pick two of the three lines. But we try to be conservative in our pipeline of opportunities when we assess that.","Operator","And our next question will come from John Rogers with D.A. Davidson.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Hi. Good morning.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning, John.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Two things. First, in terms of the overhead costs \u2013 the G&A costs, is there a significant change in terms of those rates as you look out into 2016? I mean, given where the market is, given the elimination of the fiber business or is your plan to hang on to everybody for now? I know you commented a little bit on that.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I'm not in a spot necessarily to give guidance for 2016 yet, John. But what I'd say is, yes, as a bit, as it relates to Sunesys, as an example, Sunesys had a little bit of a higher G&A structure. They were running at the 13%, 14%, 15% range. So that will give us a benefit as we move forward. I'll tell you that we've not made any significant moves from a G&A structure, because we look at our long-term growth potential to see it be there.","We've done some moves specific to some of the operations in Canada and some of the pipeline areas that Jim has spoken to. But broadly speaking, we've not made any significant moves because we still see those growth aspects being there. So I would say, right now, I think, G&A percentage is running comparable to what you're seeing in 2015, largely, of course, based upon the volume of revenue relative to absorption from a rate perspective, though.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","And our fuel G&A will moderate dependent upon the activity in any given region with any given company. And we've made \u2013 like Derrick said, we've cut close to 100 people in Canada. Corporate G&A, I mean, obviously we believe that this is a short-term downtick. And we don't see any adjustment at corporate at this time, because we do think this is a short-term dynamic and the company's grown \u2013 doubled its size over the last two years. And to some extent I feel like we're still trying to catch up with the support we need from corporate to support our operations. But certainly we pay attention to it, like Derrick said, and we'll make adjustments accordingly, if necessary.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","And Jim, if you look at the market now, you talk about the pickup in pipeline activity and certainly it looks like it's coming and transmission rebounding. But have you reassessed at all how you think about the margin opportunities given the potential for delays, project sizes, the competitive environment or \u2013 because I would of thought with larger projects, ultimately you would end up with higher margins, but we haven't gotten there yet.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, I think we did get there on electric. We were well within the 9% to 12% range and then we moved the range to 10% to 12% and that's when we had a nice complement of large transmission projects. I think you'll see this same type of margin move once we start executing on some big mainline projects and we have the consistency of that work. Right now because of the operational challenges that we've had for the first half of this year and the downtick in transmission business for the second half of the year, it's going to be more challenging to maintain that at 10% to 12% margin profile. But again, I think it's a short-term dynamic, and at some point, again our multi-year outlook is very strong on transmission.","You've got to have the transmission projects and the mainline pipe projects in order for us to hit into the middle or higher end of the range of the margin profiles that we have previously provided. But we're not going to change our bidding profile. Margins and backlog continue to be strong. I don't see any pricing dynamic changes for us right now, and we don't plan on having any going forward.","Operator","And from Stephens, we'll hear from Matt Duncan.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Want to piggyback on some of the questions just looking out to next year. And Jim, I want to make sure we understand the timing of these delayed projects. What I'm hearing is that a lot of the stuff that's been delayed you think is going to come back probably in the first quarter. And so what I'm really getting at here is have the delays and project execution issues of 2015, have those things impacted 2016 as you see it? Or should we really think about this being more sort of a 2015 issue and we're back on track when we flip the calendar?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","I can't sit here and say we are back on track, because the regulatory delays are going to continue to be an issue for this industry. I want to say we're back on track, but I'm not going to sit here and put a line in the sand and say, \"We are back on track, because it's a wild card that I don't control. And more than ever before, there's a higher percentage of these large projects in the overall mix of our consolidated revenues. And it's going to continue to grow.","I mean, it used to be 20% of our revenues used to be from large projects, now it's 40% and it's probably going to get closer to 50%. So \u2013 and those are the projects that are subject to these delays.","So I just have to be more prudent about my commentary there because I thought the end of this year we were going to continue to have growth in the large projects and that did not happen because of delays, things get pushed. Do I want 2016 to be better? I think the pipeline market because of the amount of activity that's going to be going on, that if you do have some delays, you're going to have enough other work going on that will overcome that and that's that dynamic that we experienced like I said with electric transmission for the last four years.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Sure.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Electric transmission, I do think the Nalcor \u2013 Nalcor's running now fine. I mean, we're back on track. We're getting back on track. It's still slow to recover but we're not stopped there. We just had work pushed into 2016, so 2016 for Nalcor should be fine. Unless, we run into any other weather events. This was a pretty tough year for weather in Canada and that's what's typically going to slow things down up there. As far as the regulatory delays in the Northeast, I think those are going to continue. I don't know at what pace. Infrastructure is getting built but it's a grind. It's a challenge and there's a lot of stops and starts.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate it.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","It's just hard to predict.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","And then last thing, a capital allocation question. You're essentially using the cash from the Sunesys sale to buy a lot of Quanta stock. Are you also still evaluating M&A opportunities and does this accelerate it in large repurchase take you out of the M&A game? Does it slow that down or does it have no impact on how you look at acquisitions?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. I don't know that it has any real impact at all. You're right that the biggest portion of the proceeds that are going from the \u2013 the share repurchase at this point are coming straight from the Sunesys sale. We've done roughly nine acquisitions on a year-to-date basis. We've commented in previous calls that we thought that the number of acquisitions that we saw potentially happening in 2015 would probably be somewhat comparable with what we executed on in 2014 and even in 2013.","But we did say, that we thought that the size of those acquisitions might pull back a bit, not for the purpose of specifically targeting the smaller deals, it's just that those are the ones that right now we feel are the opportunistically appropriate deal for us. But we continue to go out and we will look for those things that we think will add some level of differentiation and geography, customer relationship and the like.","So I don't think that you would see our approach to acquisitions changing. We will still be looking at allocation of capital in that regard. I will say that in the near-term, we're still probably looking at the pipeline of transactions that lead toward smaller transactions because that's what currently is in our pipeline today.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, Vishal Shah.","Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Jim. I just wanted to better understand the competitive environment. I know you mentioned there was some impact of competition in the quarter. Can you maybe just talk about where you see the most competition, whether it's electric transmission or oil and gas and what kind of competitive environment do you see, right now. I know you mentioned there is no impact on your margins in backlog. But is that something we should be worried about going forward. Thank you.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","I think the differences in competition are hard to describe. They're different between oil and gas and electric power on these mainline jobs and the big transmission jobs but you still have the same dynamic, where you can have a guy come in and take a project low. And that can happen. I think the good thing about some of these bigger projects is many of our customers are getting savvy about going with just the low bid because they're not getting the cost certainty and the desired outcome on schedule. So they end up having cost overruns and more problems than if they would've taken a quality contractor at a higher price.","And we're seeing that, obviously, we're seeing MSAs being negotiated on the pipeline side with customers that have never ever happened before in the history of this industry. Because of that reason, they want a commitment for resources and they want to deal with somebody who can provide more cost certainty around their projects. On the electric side, that dynamic's been in play for a while. And we saw that starting about three years ago.","Even longer than that, but certainly we had more negotiated work on the electric side than we did the pipeline side. But you're going to always have competition and you've just got to prove your value to your customers every day and continue to be the industry leader and that's going to be around cost certainty, safety, and make sure you get the quality and the project done on time. So as far as backlog, I mean, could you ask that question again, Vishal, on the backlog question, please?","Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I just meant your margin in the backlog were stable but on the backlog question, just can you maybe talk about when we can start expecting backlog to increase and is it going to be in transmission or oil and gas, first? Thank you.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, backlogs at record levels right now or near record levels. So our backlog position looks pretty good right now. And I think that you'll probably see and I made some comments here just a few minutes ago on Q&A that we're close to inking some more big mainline pipe programs. So I would think that in the near term you'll probably see some upticks in our oil and gas backlog in the near term before you see any big meaningful move in electric transmission.","Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we'll hear from Jeff Volshteyn.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you for taking my question. Good morning. Really just have a few clarifying questions. First, when you look at your backlog, given the discussion on the delays, are you able to give us a sense of what portions of your backlog has already been approved and started versus the portion where the work has not been started yet.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","All of our backlog is basically for the most part on our fixed price contracts, we have to have a signed contract in place. And so there's no speculative backlog there. I mean if you're going to go out and bid a $500 million job and you sign a contract, that's a $500 million contract that goes into backlog. Our MSA agreements, certainly there's- if we sign a five-year MSA, and we've been working with a customer doing $100 million a year and their capital programs aren't going to change going forward, certainly we have a more intimate relationship and understanding of what the customers' objectives are there then we will estimate the amount of backlog that we will put into an MSA contract. But those certainly we haven't had any real issues there at all since 2008 on estimating MSA backlog. But the problem is backlog again gets deferred. We've had very little backlog canceled. I can't recall of any backlog that's been canceled since I've been here at Quanta. But backlog can get pushed and that's the issue we're having is when you look at the 12-month dynamic, you can have backlog pushed out of that 12 months into \u2013 a beyond 12-month period because some of the issues we've discussed this morning.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And just on the margin question in oil and gas, you gave 7% to 8% margin expectation. You've spoken about 9% in the past. Is this just a 2015 expectation or can we change your longer-term outlook on margin?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","No, I believe that our longer-term outlook on margins remains intact for both Electric Power and Oil and Gas. We still think we can be in the 10% to 12% range in Electric Power and 9% to 12% range in Oil and Gas. This is really more the 2015 effects of the lost jobs, the weather impacts and some of those other headwinds but our longer-term rates, I believe at this point, will still stay the same.","Operator","From BB&T, we'll hear from Adam Thalhimer.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Hey, good morning, guys.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Jim, how would you compare this to in 2011, when you knew (1:18:15) was coming in 2012 but the market didn't believe. How does this feel to you versus that timeframe?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","On pipeline, I think it's deja vu over again. Okay. I think it's the same exact dynamic. It's kind of melancholy in a way. That's what's going to happen on pipeline I think.","On electric, it's a different because we're operating at a high level right now and we're maintaining that high level. We're operating a 3 times what the business was operating at five years ago on transmission and in the segment, in general. But I do see program opportunities out there that are very massive in size. A lot of these HVDC lines that could take us to the next level. It's just a matter of when that can happen but certainly I'm still very bullish on our business on a multi-year period.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then on the buyback, can you give us some flavor. You bought a lot of stock back in July and presumably you knew you were going to miss and guide down and you're committed to buyback in total about 20% of the stock from here. It's a massive buyback. Was there any internal wranglings over the timing whether you should do it now or maybe wait for more certainty on the pipe cycle?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, actually any of the stock that was bought back in the second quarter timeframe was early under a 10b5-1 program that we had put into place much earlier in the year. So there really wasn't anything that was going on unique to that buyback versus what we were stepping into.","And then as it relates to the new program itself, we started on the new program really once we saw that the Sunesys repurchase sale was going to be accelerated into this time period. When we provided guidance earlier this year we really did look at it as though it was possible that the Sunesys disposition was something that would close, although this year, much later in the year.","And then we got wind of that effectively within a very short period of time of close to here to quarter end because it looked like this was actually going to move to close. In fact, the PUC approval for it just happened last Friday. So we moved very quickly in that regard to kind of align the current share repurchase to the closing of Sunesys.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will now turn the call over to management for any closing comments.","James F.

Jim?","James F. O'Neil","Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with an operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our second quarter financial results. Following Derrick's comments, we will welcome your questions.","Our second quarter results demonstrate continued solid execution by our operations and reflects strong demand for our services. Our revenues in the second quarter grew 50% compared to the second quarter of 2011, and revenues for the first 6 months of this year have increased 58% compared to the same period last year. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.31 in the second quarter increased 107% compared to the second quarter of last year.","Our second quarter results were driven by strong performance in our electric power segment due to the significant volume of electric transmission projects underway and our ability to safely execute on those projects. Quarter over quarter and sequentially, improved performance from our natural gas and pipeline segment also contributed to the strong results.","Our employee count at the end of this year's second quarter was approximately 19,300, up 30% compared to the second quarter of last year and up 10% since the end of 2011.","Our electric power segment revenues increased approximately 52% in this year's second quarter compared to the same period last year. At the end of the second quarter, 12-month backlog for the electric power segment increased 27.4%, and total backlog for this segment increased 4.1% compared to the second quarter of 2011.","In the second quarter, Quanta completed the installation of San Diego Gas & Electric Sunrise Powerlink transmission line, which was energized on June 17. This was an extremely challenging project due to the environmental sensitivities, difficult geology and geography, and an accelerated construction timeline. For environmental reasons, nearly 75% of the project's towers were set by helicopters, resulting in more than 28,000 flight hours being logged to complete the aerial construction. The timely completion of the Sunrise Powerlink transmission line was critical due to the recent shutdown of the San Onofre nuclear plant. Because this plant supplied a significant amount of electricity to San Diego, energizing the Sunrise Powerlink line on the accelerated schedule was critical. This project, in almost every aspect, is an excellent example of Quanta's industry-leading transmission capabilities and our ability to meet our customers' expectations under challenging circumstances.","Also during the second quarter, we completed construction of Hydro One's Bruce to Milton transmission line. This 79-mile, double circuit, 500,000-volt transmission line is the largest expansion of Ontario's electric transmission system in more than 2 decades and should bring enough nuclear and renewable energy to provide more than 10% of the province's electricity needs. It is worth noting that this project was accomplished with 0 lost time injuries to Hydro One employees or contractors working on this job, demonstrating the safety commitment of everyone involved.","While Quanta was successfully completing these 2 projects in the second quarter, we also were ramping up on construction activities on 3 projects: the Devers to Palo Verde 2 project for Southern California Edison; Texas Competitive Renewable Energy Zone or CREZ project for Sharyland and ETT; and the Northwest Transmission Line project for BC Hydro. We believe the industry is in a multiyear transmission investment trend.","It has been more than 40 years since significant transmission investment occurred in North America, and various industry sources indicate approximately 2\/3 of North America's transmission infrastructure is in poor condition. Four quarters of meaningful transmission construction does not solve this challenge. The replacement or repair of aging electrical infrastructure, the installation of new transmission networks to improve reliability and the need for transmission interconnection or renewable power sources are only a few of the drivers of transmission investment. We believe certain near- and medium-term dynamics are not currently reflected in various third-party transmission spending forecast, which will require additional transmission infrastructure spending. These dynamics include the implementation of mandatory compliance with NERC reliability standards, the implementation of FERC Order 1000, which we believe will spur merchant transmission investment, and the impact of new transmission or upgraded transmission lines resulting from the retirement and conversion of older coal-fired generation plants to cleaner burning generation sources, such as natural gas-fired plants due to federal environmental regulations. For example, ICF International recently estimated that more than 50 gigawatts of coal-fired generation will be retired over the next 4 years.","Earlier this week, Quanta announced that ATCO Electric has selected Valard Construction, a Quanta services company, to install transmission infrastructure for their Hanna Region Transmission Development Project. Under the terms of the contract, Valard will install approximately 149 miles of 240-kilovolt transmission infrastructure in the Hanna region of Southeast Alberta, Canada. Resources have mobilized to begin this project, which is expected to be completed in 2013. This project is included in our backlog figure at June 30. We believe this award is indicative of the level of transmission opportunities that exist in the market. As we have highlighted in our past few earnings conference calls, we expect the timing of large transmission projects awards to be lumpy going forward. Therefore, we recommend that investors focus on new award activity over a longer term rather than on a quarterly basis.","Turning to our natural gas and pipeline segment. Revenues increased approximately 62% in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter last year. Importantly, operating income in the quarter improved from a loss of $1.2 million in last year's second quarter to $15.3 million of operating income in this year's second quarter. With the strategic moves we have made to date, we believe this segment will be profitable for the remainder of the year.","At the end of the second quarter of 2012, 12-month and total backlog for this segment increased about 59% and 20%, respectively, compared to the end of the second quarter of 2011. The significant increase in quarter-over-quarter backlog reflects the strategic shift Quanta made last year to pursue shale-gathering work and also the master service agreement we signed with Puget Sound Energy last year for natural gas infrastructure maintenance.","Despite declines in crude oil and NGL prices, we have seen increased demand for our pipeline construction services. Aggregate horizontal or directional rig counts and liquid-rich shales remain at high levels, and companies continue to maintain or increase exploration and production activities for liquids and wet shale formations, such as the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Marcellus shales. In addition, there is minimal existing infrastructure in these shales, and hundreds of wells are shut in because they do not have the pipeline-gathering infrastructure to transport the product from the wells to processing facilities. Therefore, strategic investment in gathering infrastructure is required to transport product to market in the near and long term.","We continue to see signs that a significant volume of long-haul, large-diameter projects could be awarded and moved into construction in 2013. Should most of these projects move forward, the industry could experience the most active pipeline construction market it has seen in the past several years. We will continue to gain more clarity on these projects as we approach year end. This dynamic, coupled with expectations for continued shale-gathering pipeline infrastructure development, will require significant pipeline construction resources and could result in tightening of industry capacity.","Our telecommunications segment experienced solid growth in the quarter. Revenues increased almost 26% in this year's second quarter compared to the same period last year, driven by increases in the base of construction on broadband stimulus projects and fiber-to-the-cell site projects.","Compared to the end of last year's second quarter, 12-month and total backlog for this segment decreased 2.4% and about 10%, respectively. The decrease in segment backlog was due to backlog burn associated with the significant increases in projects in construction during this year's second quarter, as well as the exploration of several multiyear master service agreements at the end of this year. However, we are actively working with these customers and are optimistic about renewing these master service agreements before year end.","In our Fiber Optic Licensing segment, revenues for the quarter increased approximately 3.5% compared to the second quarter of last year. We continue to balance the build-out of our newer markets to increase network penetration while investing in our more mature markets that generate higher margins and returns in the near term.  This balanced approach should enable us to grow revenues while maintaining high margins and acceptable rates of return on investment.","As a result of our strong first and second quarter results, the expectation of continued strength in our electric power segment and ongoing opportunities and better visibility for our natural gas and pipeline segment, we're increasing our 2012 full year outlook. Derrick will provide additional detail about our outlook during his comments.","In summary, total company backlog remains strong and we see continued opportunity to profitably grow our business. We are confident that 2012 will be a strong year for Quanta and believe that the momentum and the strength of our business should continue into the foreseeable future.","Before I turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our new CFO, I would like to recognize James Haddox for his contributions to Quanta's overall success. As CFO since our inception, James has participated in 57 quarterly conference calls, which is a substantial tenure considering the growth of the company from an annual IPO revenue of $152 million back in 1998 to where we are today. James, a big thank you to you for your service to this organization.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Derrick. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen","Thanks, Jim, and thanks, James. Good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.52 billion for the second quarter of 2012 compared to $1.01 billion in the prior year's second quarter, reflecting growth of about 50% quarter-over-quarter. Net income attributable to common stock for the quarter was $65.5 million or $0.31 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $31.8 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year.","The growth in consolidated revenues in the second quarter of 2012 was driven by growth across all of Quanta's segments. Second quarter 2012 revenues were also favorably impacted by the incremental contribution of approximately $58 million in revenues from companies acquired since the second quarter of 2011.","Our consolidated gross margin increased to 15.5% in the second quarter of 2012 from 15.2% in 2Q '11. This increase was due to strong performance in each of our segments, as well as the impact of higher revenues, which improved our ability to cover fixed costs.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were $115 million, reflecting an increase of $25 million as compared to last year's second quarter. This increase is primarily attributable to $14.5 million in higher salary and incentive compensation costs associated with increased levels of activity and profitability, approximately $5.7 million in additional administrative expenses associated with companies acquired since the second quarter of 2011, and $5.2 million in increased professional fees associated with ongoing legal matters. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 8.9% in the second quarter of 2011 to 7.6% in the second quarter of 2012, primarily due to the higher overall revenues as previously discussed.","Our consolidated operating margin before amortization expense increased from 6.3% in 2Q '11 to 8.0% in 2Q '12.","Amortization of intangible assets increased from $6.9 million in 2Q '11 to $9.5 million in the second quarter of 2Q '12 due to the acquisitions since June of last year.","To further discuss our segment results, the electric power segment's revenues were up about $347 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 52%. Revenues were positively impacted by higher revenues from electric power transmission services, resulting from an increase in the number and size of projects that were ongoing in 2Q '12 compared to 2Q '11. The increase in revenues is also attributable in part to the incremental contribution of $49 million in segment revenues from acquired company. These increases were partially offset by $36 million in lower emergency restoration services versus 2Q '11.","Operating margin in the electric power segment increased to 11% in the second quarter of 2012, compared to 10.4% in last year's second quarter, primarily due to higher overall revenues from services on higher-margin transmission projects. Additionally, the overall increase in this segment's revenue contributed to this segment's improved ability to cover fixed and overhead costs. Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in emergency restoration service revenues, which typically carry higher margins.","Natural gas and pipeline revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by 62% to about $340 million in 2Q '12 primarily due to an increase in the number of shale-gathering system projects currently under construction. Additionally, we saw increases in revenues from natural gas distribution services as the outsourced gas distribution work for Puget Sound Energy was just starting up in the second quarter of 2011. Operating income for the natural gas and pipeline segment as a percentage of revenues increased to 4.5% for 2Q '12 from a negative 0.6% for 2Q '11. This improvement was primarily due to the overall increase in the volume of this segment's revenue due to the shift to more shale-gathering system projects, which improved the segment's ability to cover fixed and overhead costs, as well as the prior year being significantly impacted by productivity issues on certain transmission pipeline projects that were hampered by unusual weather -- winter weather and complicated by restrictive governmental regulations. Although significant rainfall did adversely impact the profitability of certain projects in the second quarter of 2012, the impact was not as extensive as what was experienced in 2Q '11.","Revenues from our telecommunications segment increased $27.2 million or 26% to $133.6 million in 2Q '12, primarily due to an increase in the volume of work associated with stimulus-funded fiber optic network projects and higher revenues from fiber-to-the-cell site and wireless initiatives, resulting from higher capital spending by our customers. Operating margin in the telecommunications segment was 10.3% in 2Q '12, compared to 8.5% in 2Q '11. This increase in margin is primarily due to increased demand for our services, allowing for margin expansion, as well as the impact of revenue increases on the segment's ability to cover fixed costs.","Fiber Optic Licensing segment revenues were $28.7 million for the second quarter of 2012, reflecting an increase of 4% over 2Q '11. Operating margin was 53% in 2Q '12, compared to operating margin of 47.5% in 2Q '11.","When calculating operating margins by segment, we do not allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization expense to our segments. Therefore, the previous discussion about operating margins by segment excludes the effect of such expenses.","Corporate and non-allocated costs increased $11.8 million in the second quarter of 2012 as compared to 2Q '11, primarily as a result of $5.7 million in higher salary and incentive compensation cost associated with current levels of operating activity, $2.8 million in increased professional fees associated with ongoing legal matters and $2.7 million in higher amortization expense associated with intangible assets.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share, as calculated in today's press release, were $0.36 for the second quarter of 2012 compared to an adjusted diluted income per share of $0.19 for 2Q '11.","Cash flow provided by operations was approximately $86.3 million for the second quarter of 2012. Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales, were about $43.7 million, resulting in approximately $42.6 million in free cash flow for the quarter.","Our days sales outstanding or DSOs were 81 days at June 30, 2012, versus 79 days at March 31, 2012, and 75 days at June 30, 2011. Although DSOs were comparable to the first quarter, our cost in excess to billing balance is higher during the period. A significant component of the balance is associated with the Sunrise Electric transmission project, which was substantially accelerated during the first half of this year. This acceleration created considerable workarounds impacting the sequence of production. This out-of-scope work, which is directed by the customer in order to meet the accelerated completion date, created change order requests and delays in the final billing as reconciliations of final project activity had only just begun since the project was so recently completed. Although not fully approved yet by the customer, the change order has been billed subsequent to June 30. And in discussions with the customer, we are not aware of any circumstances that would prevent these amounts from being collected in subsequent periods.","EBITA for the second quarter of 2012 was $116.1 million or 7.7% of revenues, compared to $62.3 million or 6.2% of revenues for the second quarter of 2011. Adjusted EBITDA was $155.9 million or 10.3% of revenues for the second quarter of 2012, compared to $97.4 million or 9.6% of revenues for the second quarter of 2011. The calculation of EBITA, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, all non-GAAP measures, and the definitions of these and DSOs can be found in the Investors & Media section of our website at quantaservices.com.","At June 30, 2012, we had about $174 million in letters of credit outstanding, primarily to secure our insurance program, and we had borrowings of approximately $39 million outstanding. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $173 million in cash. Considering our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we had nearly $660 million in total liquidity as of June 30.","Concerning our outlook for 2012, we expect revenues for the third quarter of 2012 to range between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share to be $0.34 to $0.37 on a GAAP basis. These estimates compare to revenues of $1.25 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.25 in 3Q '11. Our forecast for 3Q '12 includes an estimate of $7.1 million for noncash compensation expenses and $10.4 million for amortization expenses. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter are expected to be $0.39 to $0.42 and compare to non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.29 in 3Q '11. This non-GAAP measure is calculated on the same basis as the historical calculations of adjusted diluted earnings per share presented in the release.","We currently expect revenues for the full year of 2012 to range between $5.9 billion and $6.1 billion and diluted earnings per share to be between $1.15 to $1.25 on a GAAP basis. These estimates compare to revenues of $4.6 billion and $0.62 in 2011. Our forecast for 2012 includes an estimate of $29 million for noncash compensation expenses and $38 million of amortization expense. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2012 are expected to be between $1.35 to $1.45. We are currently forecasting net income attributable to noncontrolling interests to be approximately $3.5 million in the third quarter of 2012 and between $15 million and $15.5 million for the year. For additional guidance, we are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate to be between 36% and 37% for 2012, and we expect our diluted share count to be about 213 million shares. We expect CapEx for all of 2012 to be approximately $200 million to $220 million, which includes CapEx for our Fiber Optic Licensing segment of about $40 million to $50 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2011 of $172 million.","As Jim commented, we continue to execute within all of our segments and believe our pipeline segment will continue to be profitable throughout the rest of the year. We believe that we're operationally and financially well positioned for continued solid growth in 2012 and beyond.","This concludes our formal presentation. We'll now open the lines for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with FBR Capital Markets.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","A couple of questions, first, Jim, you finished 2 big transmission projects. You started 3 big transmission projects. How should we think about the positives or negatives that came through your P&L because of all that activity? Was it a net positive? Was it a net negative because of the transition of the 2 and the 3?","James F. O'Neil","I think it's neutral, Alex. I mean, we have [indiscernible] costs that typically go into our POC accounting. So I mean, if it is a little bit negative, it would be immaterial. So it's neutral. I mean, I think the important thing is that we continue to have momentum and we're able to fill any burn with backlog in large transmission projects going forward.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","As I look at your book-to-bill and your new awards, I focus a lot more attention on 12-month backlog. And the new awards in your 12-month backlog, I think, was the third highest in history, which is an amazing number here. Do you continue to believe that new awards can remain at a very high level like they are right now for the foreseeable future?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean one thing you guys don't see are projects below $100 million, and a lot of our smaller projects continue to accelerate. I'd say our small transmission market is growing faster than the big projects. And that's our everyday work, distributions growing. Every aspect of our business has growth in it today. The big projects, we had a light quarter on awards, but that -- I expect in the third quarter, we're going to see more activity there. So I feel very confident that the backlog will be strong as we go into '13.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And it sounds like storm activity in the second quarter was maybe even somewhat of a negative. Do you expect that to kind of reverse and be a little bit more of a positive in the third quarter?","James F. O'Neil","It will be. We only have $13 million in storm revenue in the second quarter. And the storm work that we started on here in the third quarter was significantly more than $13 million that began in the first week of July. So I can tell you with confidence that storm revenues in the third quarter will be higher than in the second.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dan Mannes with Avondale Partners.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Talking real quick about your guidance. It's a really nice increase on the -- for the year and really not because of the quarter. I mean, it seems like a pretty significant move up. Can you talk a little bit about what increases your confidence or what changes your view for the balance of the year given what you've experienced, I guess, over the last quarter?","James F. O'Neil","Dan, it's really just better visibility. I mean, we're in an election year, we didn't -- we did hedge a little bit on timing on some of these project starts. But we're getting better visibility that these projects will start on time. And it's really just visibility between what we see today versus what we saw back in May.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Is there any impact from the tightness, i.e. the margins in your backlog? Have they been improving relative to where they were 3, 6, 9 months ago? Or is that not as much of an indicator?","James F. O'Neil","Margins and backlog are strong or stronger than what we're experiencing today.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I guess, can you just talk about your confidence level on the gas side with the margins that you put up with -- the worst is behind us, and how you see margins trending in the back half of the year, specifically, and what you think the implications could be for 2013? With and without big gas -- with regards to 2013, how we think about things if big gas or if it doesn't pick up, I guess.","James F. O'Neil","Well, the good thing, under Duke's leadership and trying to shift resources into these gathering fields, which we moved into that initiative about a year ago, now we're well established in these liquid-rich fields. That works almost like an MSA work. It's recurring revenues, and it is profitable. And the second quarter's a good example that we don't have to have any big pipework to gain profitability in that segment. So we expect that work to continue, that shale-gathering work. There will be some seasonality due to weather in the fourth and first quarter, but it should be more predictable going forward. Any big pipework would be incremental to that. Because those are lump-sum type projects, the margins on large pipe are 400 to 500 basis points higher than what we experience in the shale-gathering work on an average basis. So we're very excited about where we're going with the segment. Everything that we expected and communicated to you guys is playing out as expected. And we do expect to be profitable for the year in that segment. And I look forward to good things next year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Will Gabrielski with Lazard Capital Markets.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Two questions, one on electric. We have heard from a few different power generating companies that the EPA rules are starting to -- around emissions, are starting to drive some incremental transmission spending and you touched on that. I'm wondering if you could give a little more detail of whether or not you're doing that work now and what the visibility is like there. And then I'll have a follow-up.","James F. O'Neil","Not a whole lot right now, Will. We think that'll play out over the next -- probably be more significant 2, 3 years from now, even into 2020. I mean, it's a longer play for us. I mean, the main thing is that the rule will drive coal switching to gas primarily. And while those rebuilds are occurring, whether it's a rebuild or a new gas plant that's being built, transmission will either be upgraded or will be built new and -- but we think that will play out over a longer period of time. But certainly, it will be incremental to our business.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the natural gas pipeline side, I guess you're getting your hands dirty in some of the different basins that are out there now and expanding beyond the Marcellus. I'm wondering what the competitive environment looks like, union versus nonunion, and what type of progress you're making in the different fields.","James F. O'Neil","We're seeing capacity just tighten overall in that market, both union and nonunion labor. And it is presenting opportunities for us to get the pricing that we aspire to have in that business even in nonunion markets. So I did make comments in my script that capacity is tightening and we do see that continuing in the shale fields today. And we expect that will continue. And once big pipe construction moves forward in a meaningful way, we think we're going to be really tight. The industry is going to be really tight in capacity. So the momentum that we're seeing and -- our expectations are very positive for that segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Saagar Parikh - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","This is Saagar on for Tahira. My first question relates again to the pipeline business, and I know that you've touched on a little bit of this. But the second quarter pipeline profitability was -- is it really a reflection of what the base pipeline margins on a clean level should be going forward? And along with that, how many of your spreads were utilized in the second quarter because as we saw, overall pipeline revenue was down sequentially?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I think we did have some weather impact in the second quarter. So I think margins should be just -- should be a little bit better than what we experienced on a go-forward basis provided we have good weather. We should be closer to the mid to upper mid single digit operating income with just shale-gathering work. And I think we did 4.5% for the segment. Other than that, I think, going forward, if we get big pipework in the mix, we should be up in the 9% to 12% range. And I'm sorry, I didn't catch the second part of the question.","Saagar Parikh - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Oh, I just -- how many of your spreads were utilized in the second quarter because as I saw, the overall pipeline revenue was down sequentially?","James F. O'Neil","We look at spreads in 2 ways. One is equipment, and one is people. And I would say that from a personnel standpoint, we're fairly utilized in the shale-gathering work right now and in Canada. As far as spreads are concerned, we do have some underutilization on some of our specialized equipment for big pipe. But other than that, our equipment is being utilized fairly well on the equipment that can be used in both big pipe and in shale-gathering work. So I would say overall, our utilization is pretty high right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Zach Larkin with Stephens.","Zach Larkin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","First question, Jim, I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the small transmission work, the positive indications there. And I wondered if there's any kind of a geographic impact where you're seeing the most strength in the small transmission markets. Or is it something that's pretty broad-based across the country?","James F. O'Neil","It's broad-based across the country right now. I mean, it's NERC compliance standards that all of our customers have to meet. And those went into effect late last year, and we're starting to see momentum there. So we expect that will continue -- it's a multiyear trend. And it's a significant amount of work that needs to be done. So it's -- the day-to-day work, the $5 million, $10 million, $20 million, $30 million projects, but there are some specific requirements that NERC has put out that our customers need to meet, and that's driving a lot of our construction activity today.","Zach Larkin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great, thanks. And then Derrick, I wondered if you could give a little bit more color on the legal expense. Is that something that you expect to kind of continue through the end of the year? Or do you have any sense on when those expenses might curtail?","Derrick A. Jensen","I think we'll have some form of expense through probably the rest of this year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Scott Levine with JPMorgan.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I was hoping you might be able to provide a little bit more color on priorities for cash for deployment. I know you made some discussion about investing in individual projects on a select basis, maybe any thoughts there, as well as your current M&A outlook and appetite for acquisitions either in the U.S. or overseas.","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure. I'd say that it remains somewhat constant. And as you saw from the second quarter, I mean, our first demand is working capital to support our projects. And as we talked about, we have capital expenditure needs for this year. We are optimistic still on the acquisition and investment side. I mean, we've talked about some smaller investments  that are out there. And at the same time, from an acquisition standpoint, I'd say that we closed 10 acquisitions in the last 12 months. And I believe we'll continue to see that -- a similar type of opportunistic activity over the next 12 months.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And Jim, I'm not sure if I caught this as well in your prepared comments. Is there any update regarding your thoughts on the renewables business for this year, in particular the solar side?","James F. O'Neil","Renewables will be strong this year, particularly solar, as we take advantage of -- our customers take advantage of the 1603 tax grant that expired at the end of last year. So we do have significant activity. We will experience strong double-digit growth in solar this year and renewables overall. And I expect that, that trend will last into '13. Beyond that, I think a lot of it has to do with what state RPS does because federal subsidies are expiring, but for the foreseeable future, it's going to be a very active business for us.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Beach with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jeffrey L. Beach - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. One, the electric margin in this quarter at 11% on record revenues, below the margins of the last 3 quarters at least, and you had a couple of major project close-outs, can you describe why the margin is lower this quarter than the past 2 or 3?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, this is Derrick. The primary reason is actually the amount of storm work. I mean, when you look at the amount of the storm work we had in the fourth quarter of last year and the second quarter of last year, as well as even the first quarter of this year, we had substantially higher revenues from storm and yet, in all of those periods. And those things come in at higher margin. This quarter, we only had $13 million of storm work that compares to numbers of -- in the neighborhood of like $50 million from the previous period. So that's a pretty big driver. And then kind of sequentially, I mean, from the first quarter to second quarter, we had great weather in the first quarter, allowing us to have substantially higher productivity. That contributed to both revenues and reduced costs in the first quarter that when we come to the second quarter, those weren't quite the same.","Relative to close-outs, there wasn't anything unusual in the second quarter relative to any close-out jobs. So there wasn't anything negatively impacted in the quarter.","Jeffrey L. Beach - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And as the follow-up, can you tell us what the growth rate was in your electric distribution revenues this quarter year-over-year?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean, I think last year, we said we had about 10%. And again, we don't measure this segment. There is some gray line between small transmission and large distribution. But it's not a bright line. But I would say that we're experiencing close to 15% to 20% growth in distribution year-to-date, compared to 10% year-over-year last year over the prior year. So distribution does continue to accelerate, and we're real pleased about that.","Jeffrey L. Beach - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Does any of that have to do with the extreme hot weather?","James F. O'Neil","It has to do with extreme hot weather, NERC reliability standards, pent-up demand because distribution has been at very low levels. Distribution mainly has been at low levels since '08, and it's really catch-up. So it's also housing. Housing reports over the last quarter have started to turn, and we do have some new housing starts. So it's a combination of different things, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was just wondering a little bit about the guidance. And Jim, you kind of mentioned some better visibility is giving you the confidence to raise the guidance. Is there any change in your overall approach, where you try to be real conservative and really put in there what you know you have? Or has the execution success here over the first 2 quarters of the year maybe encouraged you to have a little bit more confidence just broadly speaking as you go into the second half?","James F. O'Neil","I think the midpoint of our guidance is consistent with the approach that we've taken since the first of the year when it comes to the timing and start of large projects and our visibility into the gas business. So I would say the midpoint of our guidance has very little uncommitted gas in there. Our non -- no uncommitted gas for the year.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just as it relates to the pipelines. Typically, the winter months have been the bidding season for the large-diameter stuff. You kind of mentioned in your press release here that you're expecting a couple of large projects come forward. With the winter months a few months off still, do you think that the seasonality of those pipeline bookings could maybe change this year and come earlier than it normally has in the past?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I think you're going to see a change in the seasonality of awards probably over the next 2 to 3 years because of the amount of large, multiyear potentially projects that are going to be proposed to bring liquids from Canada and from these liquid shale plays to refinery centers. So the normal cyclicality of this business could provide more visibility on big diameter -- large-diameter, long-haul pipe for probably at least 2 to 3 years. That's what we think will occur. We're pretty confident that, that's what we're going to see going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ahmar Zaman with Piper Jaffray.","Shawn E. Lockman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","This is Shawn on for Ahmar. I noticed on the balance sheet, you guys took out some long-term debt this quarter. I'm wondering if you could kind of walk us through what prompted that and how you're using it.","Derrick A. Jensen","I'm not sure I understood the second part of your question or heard the second part. But relative to the debt, back to the working capital demands in the quarter, we've had substantial growth. And then as we talked about some of the aspects of Sunrise, it takes some draws on our cash. But in addition, we closed an acquisition in the quarter, which was about $26 million of cash. And we also put the additional investment in Howard Energy, which we talked about in the first quarter, which is an additional $52 million of cash. So those things combined just took some short-term cash needs. I'd say that by the end of the year, we wouldn't expect to have any borrowings outstanding.","Shawn E. Lockman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And I wonder if you could just take a bigger picture question here. I mean, we talk a lot about kind of the challenges of an election year. The outlook that as we get past the election this year that we're going to see some acceleration of work in 2013 or just to kind of get your thoughts on that.","James F. O'Neil","Well, we haven't quantified or given any guidance for '13, but there is nothing that doesn't lead us to believe that '13 is going to be a very strong year from what we have in backlog today and what we expect will happen going forward in all of our segments, really. I mean, we have momentum in all of our segments and we haven't seen any reason to believe that '13 won't be a very strong year. It doesn't matter who wins the election. Infrastructure is still going to be one of the primary objectives of either administration. So we're feeling confident going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of William Bremer with Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","My first question is on pipeline integrity. Can you give us an update on that aspect of pipeline. And my second question specifically deals with Canada. Can you give us a little more color on Canada's operations both in the electrical and the pipe side for this last quarter?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean, I think the Hanna award is just -- reflects the opportunities in Canada. There is a similar build opportunities in Canada as there are in the U.S. It's just occurring probably a year or 2 later than what the U.S. experienced. I mean, that's reflected not only by Hanna, but the Northwest Transmission Line. So that works out in about those 2 projects and we look forward to executing and growing our businesses in the Canadian market. The pipeline integrity business, it's going to be a strong business. I think that's an area of our business that can grow more than any other part of our business, but it's growing off of a smaller base and I think that's going to materialize over time. That's a longer-term growth opportunity for us that, I think, could be something material in 3 to 4 to 5 years from now but it seems the regulations are going to draw a significant amount of construction and rehabilitation efforts in the pipeline market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Irwin with Wedbush Securities.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Jim, you mentioned that you have a pretty high level of utilization. I was hoping that you might be able to shed some color on whether or not this makes you a little bit more selective in the jobs that you accept and how you see potentially expanding the utilization and -- or at least your capacity to handle similar levels of utilization going forward, and then whether or not the current high levels of activity are impacting labor rates and if you see that out there on the horizon.","James F. O'Neil","Well, the labor -- let me address the labor rates first. We're under multiyear agreements with -- we're in the pipeline unions, the different unions that are associated with the pipeline industry. Those are multiyear agreements. Labor rates aren't going crazy right now for us. I mean, they're multiyear agreements that we negotiate when they expire, very similar to the electric business. We're not utilizing our big pipe equipment right now. And we're very comfortable that when the big pipework comes that we're going to be able to provide the necessary resources and execute on those projects. It was imperative for us to maximize utilization of our people and what equipment that we could share on shale pipework to move back toward a profitable segment. So that was an imperative objective for us. But we're certainly well positioned strategically to not only keep that work ongoing in the shales, but to capitalize on opportunities in the big pipework. Very similar to the electric route. Everybody was worried about how we were going to move from being on 2 transmission projects to 12, and we were able to deliver there, from a resource standpoint. And we're just as confident that we're going to be able to capitalize on the pipeline market as it expands as well.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","My follow-up question, I wanted to ask if you could give us an update on your initiative in combined cycle power plants, where you stand on that and what your potential outlook is for bookings in that market over the course of the year.","James F. O'Neil","That's a niche market for us that we're trying to greenfield into. And some of that work has been pushed out a little bit further than what we thought it would from a standpoint of accelerating, the market accelerating, which is okay, because we're using our renewable folks into that type of business. And our renewable folks are very active right now, building solar plants. And the wind market has also picked up somewhat. So it's a niche market for us. It's not immaterial today. Hopefully, we'll be able to talk more about that. It's a growth area for us in '13 or even in '14, but it's more of a future opportunity for us, not something that is really going to materialize anytime near soon.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","On the -- with regards to your outlook for the long-haul pipeline segment, are you bidding on those jobs yet? And if not, when do you expect to see those bids come out?","James F. O'Neil","We're having discussions with customers, okay, and nothing's really formally come out to bid right now. We're just having discussions with customers about capacity concerns into '13 and '14 because the industry is going to be tight. So we -- like I said in my prepared remarks, we think that this will become clear to everyone as we get into the fourth quarter. And certainly into the first quarter, we'll have much more visibility on what's going on in the big pipe market. But we haven't bid anything to date yet, no.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then I wanted to ask secondly on telecom. What are the atmospherics like in that business right now? And are there any catalysts there, say, over the next 12 months?","James F. O'Neil","Yes. I mean, I think right now, we're at the height of stimulus construction and things are going really, really well. And I don\u2019t anticipate that, that is going to lighten up anytime soon. I mean, stimulus is going to take us well into '13 and probably to the end of '13. The Universal Services Fund is a big opportunity. That's a program that's almost like a federal stimulus that we think will provide subsidies to the telecom market equal to what we're seeing in stimulus today as we get beyond '13. So that's a huge potential opportunity that could keep our telecom business strong beyond stimulus as well as many of our customers are starting to move forward with capital projects beyond stimulus. Stimulus really got them a head start on their strategic objectives. So we're feeling pretty good about telecom right now going forward.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The first question is on the gas business, just a follow-up to a question earlier. Your revenues were down sequentially the last 2 quarters in that business, but the margins improved significantly. So I'm just trying to get an understanding, get my head around that, what were the big changes between this quarter and the last couple of quarters where you were able to increase the profitability of that business?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, this is Derrick. Actually, it's similar to our discussion of second quarter of this year versus second quarter of last year in that there were some weather impacts that impacted a few of the jobs in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. At the same time, from a revenue perspective, we had the wrap-up of at least one large diameter pipeline job in the first quarter. We didn't have any of that work in the second. So you had kind of a decrease in revenue because of that.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So the right way to think about it is, weather impacts really have that kind of ability to change your profitability on those projects, and it seems like this quarter was a much cleaner, from a weather perspective, than it had been in previous quarters. Is that right?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, weather actually is an impact, but we also established ourselves in the shales. And we weren't in the shales last year at this time as well. So that's going to help us as well in the second quarter of this year, certainly, against the second quarter of last year.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess just a follow-up question there is, you're still not at your target of 9% to 12% margins in that business and my understanding is that there is -- in order to get to 9% to 12%, you're likely going to need to book some of these large-diameter pipe projects. And so maybe help me understand your confidence, I guess, on the timing of some of these projects, Keystone being one of them, one that we haven't talked about yet today.","James F. O'Neil","Well, again, we're confident that Keystone and other projects will go forward in '13 and '14 because of the discussions we've been having with customers. And not only us, but other contractors in the industry have -- will give you that same data point. You will see big pipe taking liquids from these liquid-rich shale plays and the Canadian oil sands go to refining centers primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. Look at the expansion plans in the capital that's going into expanding these refineries. You haven't seen that in decades. That's all associated -- or primarily associated with liquids coming from these shales. Right now, they're railing and trucking product. That's a very inefficient means of transporting products. Once they get enough gathering in place, gathering systems in place, you will start seeing big pipe built. And I think that, from what we're hearing from our customers, the big pipelines are going to start coming in '13 and '14. We do need to get some of that big pipework in order to get to that 9% to 12% operating income target. And we're confident that we'll see that big pipework come sometime in '13 and certainly into the '14 and '15 time frame.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from the line of Will Gabrielski with Lazard Capital Markets.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Jim, can you quantify what underutilization of the big pipeline equipment, what impact that had on the natural gas margin in Q2?","James F. O'Neil","It's mid single digit operating income to the 9% to 12% operating range. I mean, the primary reason that we have that delta in margins is because we have higher margin work on the big pipework, as well as underutilization of equipment. So I don't think we can quantify it any better than that, really. I mean that direction is what it does for you.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just quickly on working capital, where that's going to trend maybe over the next few quarters based on what you have in hand today?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes. I think that the biggest driver of working capital is obviously our receivables and DSOs, and I think that what we'll see is that by the time we get to the end of the year that, that will start to trend downward. Historically, working capitals run about 15% of revenues and -- but as we go forward, a lot of revenue is coming up right now. And some of these things can get tied up in some of these larger jobs, but I'd say that you can look at DSOs being able to be improved.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Saagar Parikh - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","This is Saagar again. I have a quick question -- I apologize if I missed this in Derrick's commentary earlier. But the rise that you -- the ramp that you guys had with the Sunrise Powerlink project, just finishing that up in the second quarter, did that have -- how much of a damper did that have on your electric power operating margins? What sort of impact could we see going forward from the change order? And is that built into your updated guidance?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, there wasn't any impact relative to margins. I mean, that job has recorded consistent margins throughout the period. And as it relates to -- I think the second part of your question is kind of what risk profile. And we believe that we're in substantial conversation with the customers such that the change order will come through and be collected at some point in time between now and the end of the year. It's tough to predict, I guess, the change order effect as far as when it will be settled, but we're pushing for settlement as soon as possible.","Saagar Parikh - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And I'm assuming that's built into your guidance then?","Derrick A. Jensen","Well, that job is complete at this point. So relative to an income impact, there wouldn't -- there will not be any income impact.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the question-and-answer session.

Jim?","James F. O'Neil","Thank you, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with an operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our second quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","Quanta produced a record second quarter revenues, operating income and earnings per share, fueled strong performance in our Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment, which reflects continuing demand for our services, safe project execution and Quanta's leadership position in the energy infrastructure marketplace. Overall, we believe we continue to remain in the double-digit growth environment as we have significant work underway and are currently in a robust bidding and negotiating period with our customers.","Our electric power segment experienced margin pressure during the second quarter due to the challenging effects of the late breakup in Canada and northern parts of the United States, which we discussed on our first quarter earnings call. This dynamic impacted productivity primarily on electric transmission projects in those areas. However, that dynamic is now behind us and we expect improved margin performance for our electric power segment comparable to historical results for the remainder of 2014 and remain comfortable with the midpoint of our full year 2014 diluted earnings per share guidance.","Backlog declined slightly from record levels at the end of the first quarter of this year but remains strong. We continue to have visibility into significant work that could drive backlog to new record levels. We are currently bidding or negotiating a record dollar volume of project opportunities and are in the late stages of finalizing contract terms on several sizable agreements with customers in both the electric power and oil and gas industries that we expect to finalize in the coming months. Our outlook for North America electric transmission spending remains positive for these reasons and is largely shaped by our conversations and strategic relationships with many of the leading utilities across North America, which gives us valuable insight into their multi-year infrastructure capital programs. Further, according to a recent report by the C3 Group, a leading energy industry market intelligence services -- service, based on transmission spending from 2008 through 2013, 17 of the most active U.S. utilities are projected to increase their aggregate transmission spending by 81% or an 8.8% compound annual growth rate from 2014 through 2020.","PPL Electric Utilities' Northeast Pocono reliability transmission project, which we were selected for in the second quarter, is representative of this spending. For this project, we will install approximately 68 miles of new 230-kilovolt and 1 38-kilovolt overhead transmission line and related services.","In Canada, current and anticipated transmission activity remains strong due to regional increases in load demand, development of hydropower generation, reliability challenges, integration of renewables into the grid and the export of power to the U.S. and other dynamics. In fact, forecasted transmission spending data from SNL, a leading energy industry intelligence service, indicates a robust Canada market through at least 2017. The smaller project transmission market in North America also remains active as utilities upgrade, replace and construct new transmission lines to address reliability challenges associated with coal-fired generation retirements, integration of renewables into the grid, reliability compliance and other issues. For example, in the second quarter, we were awarded a project to remove 39 miles of a 500-kilovolt lattice steel line and replace it with new 500-kilovolt line and lattice steel structures with a 230-kilovolt underbuilt line.","This month, we were awarded a project to reconduct approximately 50 miles of double circuit 345-kilovolt transmission line, which also includes reinforcement or replacement of transmission structures. In response to several physical attacks on viable electric infrastructure in the United States, the North America Energy Reliability Council (sic) [North American Electric Reliability Corporation], or NERC, has proposed new reliability standards to enhance the physical security of the most critical bulk power system facilities in North America. As these reliability standards are implemented, we see attractive opportunities to leverage our consulting, engineering and construction expertise to provide solutions to our customers.","Additionally, we are seeing further indications that utilities are positioning themselves to capitalize on transmission opportunities associated with FERC Order 1000 implementation. Several utilities have recently announced the formation of new transmission companies to pursue FERC Order 1000 transmission opportunities. We believe FERC Order 1000 will have a positive effect on transmission investment and present opportunities for Quanta in the future.","Electric distribution remains active as utilities implement system-hardening initiatives to better resist severe storm events. Utilities are also enhancing distribution networks as distributed generation, demand response and other technologies are deployed. Recovery in new home construction in certain markets continues to drive distribution activity, and we expect these dynamics to continue for at least the next couple of years, providing additional opportunity for growth.","Demand for our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services remains strong, driven by the development of unconventional shale plays in North America, the Canadian oil sands and coal seam gas in Australia. Our Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment revenues grew significantly and our operating income margins expanded as compared to the second quarter of last year due to favorable end-market demand and increased contributions from mainline pipeline projects in North America and Australia. We remain active in building midstream gathering infrastructure in the United States, shale plays and are currently working on mainline projects already in backlog.","In the second quarter, we were awarded a mainline pipe project in Canada. This project will be built during the winter with the significant majority of construction occurring in 2015. We continue to expect demand for our mainline pipe construction services to increase. Discussions and negotiations with various customers about specific mainline projects and multi-year alliance agreements continue to advance. Most of these projects and work under these potential multi-year agreements are anticipated to begin construction in 2015. We expect to complete contract negotiations on 1 or more of these opportunities before year end.","Based on our knowledge of pipeline company capital programs throughout North America, we believe demand for mainline pipe construction services could exceed industry capacity in the coming years. We also expect Canadian mainline pipe activity to be particularly strong for several years. Quanta has been one of the leading mainline pipe construction companies in Canada for many years and we believe we are uniquely positioned for future Canadian mainline pipe opportunities.","As a leading pipeline construction company with extensive engineering capabilities, program management, manpower resources and equipment fleet, we have the scope and scale across North America to assist our customers in achieving their mainline pipe construction programs. Coupled with our reputation, track record for safe execution and customer relationships, we are well positioned to be an important participant during this historic time for the North American oil and gas markets.","While mainline pipe projects get a lot of attention, our oil and gas segment provides a wide range of infrastructure services. Many of the projects we work on in this segment are midstream projects that are -- that typically fly below the radar of investors. Other services we provide include the logistics of managing and transporting all of the pipe for the project from the mill to the project right-of-way, specialty trenching or directional drilling services, and building and installing compression and pumping facilities. Further, the facilities associated with extracting, storing, processing and transporting hydrocarbons require electrical infrastructure for access to power, which offers synergies between our electric power and oil and gas infrastructure operations. That is the strength of Quanta.","We have the ability to offer comprehensive solutions to our customers, which diversifies our revenues and expands our end-market opportunities. Developing comprehensive infrastructure solutions has been a significant driver of our acquisition strategy. I commented earlier on the contributions of our Australian expansion on mainline pipe and as we highlighted in our earnings release this morning, we have now expanded our Australian presence into the electric power infrastructure space with the acquisition of Consolidated Power Projects, or CPP. CPP is an Australian electric engineering and construction company that offers a fully integrated service offering for high-voltage electric assets. We continue to view the Australian market as a significant growth opportunity.","And finally, our Fiber Optic Licensing operation continues to perform well. Demand for our dark fiber network remains solid, and our lit services rollout continues to progress in our Northeast markets. We are engaging current and potential new customers with the broad platform of private network communication solutions that we offer. And we see attractive growth opportunities over the next several years as our lit service offering gains some traction in 2015 and beyond.","In summary, during the first half of this year, we executed well and met the financial expectations we established. End-market drivers remain firmly in place and demand for our specialty infrastructure services is strong. We have visibility into significant new project awards this year that could drive higher levels of backlog. We expect our financial performance for the second half of this year to improve and be stronger than the first half. We continue to see opportunity for double-digit growth and our multi-year outlook remains positive. As electric power and oil and gas infrastructure projects become larger and more complex, more customers are turning to Quanta to provide comprehensive infrastructure solutions. We believe we have the scope and scale, technology, expertise, safety programs and track record that differentiate us in the markets we serve. We continue to execute on strategies that position Quanta for both near- and long-term growth.","I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his financial review of the second quarter. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.86 billion for the second quarter of 2014 compared to $1.47 billion in the prior year second quarter, reflecting an increase of 26.5% in quarter-over-quarter revenues.","Net income attributable to common stock for the quarter was $81.1 million or $0.37 per diluted share as compared to $70.2 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Included in the second quarter of 2013 was noncash stock-based compensation expense of approximately $4.3 million or $0.01 per diluted share related to the retirement of Quanta's former Chairman effective May 23, 2013.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share as presented in today's press release was $0.43 for the second quarter of 2014 as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.38 for the second quarter of 2013. The increase in consolidated revenues in the second quarter of 2014 as compared to the same quarter last year was primarily due to an 18.4% increase in revenues from our electric infrastructure services segment and 51.7% increase in revenues from our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment.","Revenues contributed during the quarter from companies acquired subsequent to June 30 of last year are estimated at around $200 million, which indicates that organic growth in consolidated revenues was in the double-digit range of approximately 10% to 11%. Our consolidated gross margin was 15.1% in the second quarter of 2014 as compared to 16.4% in the second quarter of 2013. As Jim briefly mentioned in his commentary, the weather aspects of the first quarter 2014 did carry over and impact our performance in the second quarter of 2014, primarily in Canada and northern regions of the U.S. as we dealt with the late breakup as these areas thawed from a very cold first quarter as well as other very wet conditions. This impacted our overall productivity for the quarter and therefore reduced profitability of certain projects, primarily in the electric power segment.","Selling, general and administrative expenses as presented in this quarter's press release were $139.4 million in the second quarter of 2014, reflecting an increase of $20.4 million as compared to last year's second quarter. This increase is primarily attributable to $15 million in incremental G&A costs associated with companies acquired since the second quarter of 2013 and $5.5 million in higher professional fees primarily associated with ongoing legal matters. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 7.5% in the second quarter of 2014 from 8.1% in the second quarter of 2013. Primarily due to the impact of the higher revenues described above, the impact of lower cost structures of certain other companies acquired after the second quarter of last year, as well as lower noncash stock-based compensation expense due to the previously described impact of the $4.3 million expense included in the second quarter of 2013.","Our consolidated operating margin before amortization expense was 7.6% for 2Q '14 compared to 8.3% consolidated operating margin in the second quarter of '13. Amortization of intangible assets increased to $8.6 million in the second quarter of 2014 from $5.1 million in 2Q '13 primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions that have closed since the second quarter of last year.","To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues were $1.24 billion, reflecting an increase of $192.8 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 18.4%. Revenues during the quarter were positively impacted by increased revenues from electric power transmission, distribution and power generation projects, which resulted primarily from increased capital spending by our customers and an estimated $50 million in revenues by acquired companies.","Operating margin in the electric power segment decreased to 9% in the second quarter of 2014 as compared to 11.5% in last year's second quarter, primarily due to the effects of the late winter breakup and other wet weather effects described in my earlier comments. Additionally, the decrease in quarter-over-quarter gross margin was attributable to the higher margins earned on certain power generation projects that were completed during the second quarter of 2013 as compared to the second quarter of 2014.","12-month and total backlog for the electric power segment increased significantly when compared to the second quarter of 2013 primarily due to new awards and, to a lesser extent, from acquired companies. 12-month and total backlog decreased slightly from year end due to period-over-period backlog having some lumpiness associated with the timing of awards and contract burn as discussed in prior quarters.","Oil and gas segment revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by 51.7% to $585.4 million in 2Q '14 as a result of revenue contributions of an estimated $150 million from companies acquired since the quarter, second quarter of 2013, as well as revenue increases due to increased capital spending by our customers. Operating income for the oil and gas segment as a percentage of revenues increased to 9.5% in 2Q '14 from 7.2% in 2Q '13. This increase was predominantly due to strong execution on certain mainline pipe projects in both the U.S. and Australia and contingencies associated with these projects as well as better fixed-cost absorption due to higher revenues.","Total backlog for the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment at the end of the second quarter of 2014 was consistent with the amounts reported at year end. However, 12-month and beyond 12-month backlog were impacted by the change in anticipated start date of a project to beyond the 12-month backlog period. Comparable changes occurred between the first and second quarter of 2014.","Our Fiber Optic Licensing and other segment revenues were down $2 million or 4.9% to $40 million in 2Q '14 as compared to $42.1 million in 2Q '13 primarily due to lower levels of ancillary telecommunication service revenues. Operating margin was 35.4% in 2Q '14 as compared to 34% in 2Q '13 primarily due to lower network maintenance costs in the quarter.","Corporate and unallocated costs increased $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2014 as compared to 2Q '13 primarily as a result of a $3.5 million increase in amortization expense related to 2014 and 2013 acquisitions and a $2.3 million increase in consulting and other business development fees, partially offset by lower noncash stock-based compensation costs due to the higher stock-based compensation expense in last year's second quarter that I spoke of earlier.","EBITA for the second quarter of 2014 was $136.4 million or 7.3% of revenues compared to $117.4 million or 8% of revenues for the second quarter of 2013. Adjusted EBITDA was $186 million or 10% of revenues for the second quarter of 2014 compared to $163.6 million or 11.1% of revenues for the second quarter of 2013. The calculation of EBITA, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, all non-GAAP measures, and the definitions of these and day sales outstanding, or DSOs, can be found in the Investors and Media section of our website at quantaservices.com.","For the second quarter of 2014, cash flow provided by operations was approximately $33 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $71 million resulting in approximately $39 million of negative free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $16 million for the second quarter of 2013. The decline in free cash flow was primarily driven by prepayments related to the renewal and extension of certain of our insurance policies, which have historically occurred during the third quarter, as well as the payment of the liability associated with the arbitration decision in the first quarter of 2014 as discussed in today's earnings release. DSOs were 78 days at June 30, 2014, compared to 72 days at December 31, 2013, and 83 days as of the second quarter of last year, which is adjusted for the reclass of the Sunrise change order.","Impacting our financing cash flows during the second quarter of 2014 was our use of approximately $45 million in cash for the purchase of approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock under our 3-year $500 million stock repurchase program, which we announced late last year. At June 30, 2014, we had about $244 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding primarily to secure our insurance program, and we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $189 million in cash with approximately $40 million in U.S. funds and $149 million relating to our foreign operations. Considering our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we had nearly $1.27 billion in total liquidity as of June 30, 2014.","Concerning our outlook for 2014, we expect revenues for the third quarter of 2014 to range between $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion and diluted earnings per share to be $0.52 to $0.54 on a GAAP basis. These estimates compare to revenues of $1.65 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share of 43% -- $0.43 in the third quarter of 2013, which includes the benefit of $0.03 per share from the release of tax contingencies.","Our GAAP EPS forecast for the third quarter of 2014 includes an estimate of $8.5 million for noncash stock-based compensation expense and $9.1 million for amortization expense. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2014 is expected to be $0.57 to $0.59, and compares to our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.46 in the third quarter of 2013. We expect revenues for the full year of 2014 to range between $7.6 billion and $7.8 billion. We expect diluted earnings per share to be between $1.58 and $1.68 on a GAAP basis. Our GAAP EPS forecast for 2014 includes an estimate of $37.6 million for noncash stock-based compensation expense and $34.9 million of amortization expense.","Our expectations for non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year of 2014 are between $1.90 and $2. This compares to $1.71 in 2013. Our forecast of non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share presented in our release.","We are currently forecasting net income attributable to noncontrolling interests to be approximately $4 million to $5 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $15 million to $16 million for the year. For additional guidance, we're currently projecting our GAAP tax rate to be between 34.5% and 35.5% for 2014 and our diluted share count to be about 219.2 million shares.","We expect CapEx for all of 2014 to be approximately $300 million to $325 million, which includes CapEx for our fiber licensing and other segment of about $50 million to $60 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2013 of $264 million. Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth, and an opportunistic approach toward acquisitions, investments and the repurchases of stock.","This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take your first question from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I missed the first minute or so of your comments, so just -- within the electric business, wondering if you could comment on how the year is playing out relative to your expectations at the start of the year and what's your confidence in a better rate of bookings in that segment later this year?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I think that the year on electric is playing out as we expected it to. I think the revenues and margins that we expect to generate are consistent with what we guided at the beginning of the year. We are bidding and negotiating more work than I've ever seen before in the history of this company, and there are many opportunities on both the electric side and on the oil and gas side to build additional backlog. So the outlook is bright from my standpoint. I think we've got significant opportunities. Our guys are really doing a great job in the field executing, and we're meeting our customers' expectations as these projects get bigger and more complex and, as a result, we're getting more opportunities to grow our business as our customer capital programs expand.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then on the pipeline side, just curious, now that you have it back into the execution on the mainline pipes for a couple of quarters, just really what you have learned from the execution experience you've had. And I heard you say you're going to be executing some mainline pipe projects in the winter. So I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of how confident we should be about the expected execution there.","James F. O'Neil","Well, as I mentioned on the call, we have a lot of work pending in Canada. And a lot of that work is performed in the winter months when the ground is frozen. You can't work in many of these permafrost areas until that phenomenon occurs. So that's one reason why we're seeing the first quarter, second quarter, not -- we don't see the seasonality that we've seen in the past because we're doing more work in Canada and it's more conducive to work it in the winter. So that's not -- we don't expect any execution issues. To answer your first question, I mean, we've done a really nice job, like I said on the first question, executing across all of our segments and those results are being seen at the bottom line.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess first question is, I know you've guided your range for the midpoint of your 2014 range is the same, but I would love to get a sense of why you've taken the top end down by a smidgen. Your revenue line is -- guidance is the same so -- and your first quarter performance, first half performance seems to be in line. Any color on that would be helpful.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, Tahira, this is Derrick. As it relates to the top end on the EPS side, we've guided throughout the early portion of this year that we'd have some degree of mainline awards as a potential and we had a degree of uncommitted work associated with those mainline awards and it looks as though that -- although that some of those awards are coming about, that most of that production would actually occur in 2015, which is one of the things that we had said relative to our overall guidance, is that, that opportunity existed. So because of that and the work occurring more the -- either the very, very end of '14 or rolling into '15, we've decided we would reduce the top end of the EPS range. Having said that, the overall growth of the company in most everything else is still continuing to grow. It's just that the contribution at the mainline will be pushed off a little bit. So that's why revenues you see still yet within that higher portion of the range.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. I guess, the second question I had was on the electric T&D side, we've seen some incrementally positive regulatory decisions in a sense. The ROE case that people are worried about, if anything, has been slightly more positive than the utilities anticipated, and really the commentary coming out of earnings even from, say, some large utilities is they're raising the CapEx on the transmission side. So could you talk about some of the large projects. I know Canada has been humming along. But are you seeing any more movement now that, that is settled in a sense on some of the large projects in the U.S.?","James F. O'Neil","Tahira, I don't want to point out any specific project. I'll just tell you that almost all of our key customers are -- really, most of the utilities in the United States are increasing their CapEx going forward. Regulation's a big driver of that spend. That's one reason why I highlighted the physical security of assets needing to be strengthened because that's just another opportunity for us to generate revenues from opportunities. We continue to see positive trends in the electric segment and it bodes well for the future performance.","Operator","And we'll move on to Noelle Dilts with Stifel.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted -- Derrick, to circle back on your comment about some of these projects getting pushed, pipeline projects getting pushed from late '14 into '15, I think there's been a lot of chatter in the market about some of these projects getting a little bit pushed to the right. And I'm curious if you guys have any thoughts on why that's happening. Is it just the fact that these are complex projects or if maybe there are some constraints at FERC in terms of getting some of these approvals through? I'd just be curious to hear your thoughts on that.","James F. O'Neil","Yes, Noelle, this is Jim. I'll take that. We're just saying, it's not anything that I would be concerned about. I mean, we still see a very active mainline environment. It really gets into the dynamic of the end of the year, which is more of a cutoff issue for us. And we are seeing some projects push. I mean, when does it -- some projects are starting later in the year than we thought. When does it freeze in Canada? When can you get started? Does the project start more in the fourth quarter or in the first? So it's that type of dynamic. We did have -- there are some projects -- there is at least 1 project that pushed from this calendar year till next from a winter-build standpoint. But I wouldn't say it's anything that we didn't expect that could happen. And it's nothing that really alarms us from a standpoint of the overall market opportunity we see in mainline in the next couple of years.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my second question, given that you're working on negotiating these longer-term agreements in pipeline, could you just give us a sense of what maybe one of those relationships would look like? Would you be doing all of the work for this customer you'd have the relationship with? And then if you could give us just some thoughts on if you're having some success in maybe sharing some of the weather risks on these projects more equitably.","James F. O'Neil","Well, I think you have to. I mean, when you look at multi-year agreements, you really don't know what specific project you're going to be building 3 years out. And the project could be, it could be built in the wintertime or in the summertime so there has to be some shared risk, because you'd -- on any -- and historically, you're bidding on a given project that's starting. The scope of that project is well defined. The time of year you're building it is well defined. The geographic area you're building it is well defined. In these 5-year relationships, it's really -- 3-, 4-, 5-year relationships, it's more of a commitment to meet that customer's needs going forward. So you have to have a more shared-risk approach because you don't know all of those key dynamics that allow you to bid a project and take more risk. And to your question about is the customer going to deal with just 1 contractor or several. I would say that it's all of the above. You could have a customer go with 1 contractor. You have some customers that have such large capital programs over the next several years that they're probably going to have to go with 2 or more.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I think I missed this, but just, can you talk a little bit more about the electric margin in Q2 and how that's expected to trend in the back half of the year?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, this is Derrick. As it relates to the second quarter, the margin came in about 9%. We had anticipated that the margin would be impacted during the quarter, predominantly associated with the breakup effects, late winter breakup effects that we had talked about in the first quarter. That's the predominant effect of that. It came in probably, I'll say [ph] maybe a little bit lower than we expected because not only the impact of the breakup, but then we also had various wet weather associated with the spring weather in the Midwest and various other factors. We had some startup costs associated with some new MSA work. We had a little bit of transition from some of the transmission work such that we had some slight negatives associated with some job closeouts. So a couple of different things happened but, by far, the predominant impact was associated with breakup. As it relates to the rest of the year, we continue to see the margins in electric power to be in the 10% to 12% range, and I would anticipate that the third and fourth quarter are going to have margins from what we would see today comparable to what you've seen in previous periods.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, I wanted to ask about -- the new full year guidance implies Q4 as a little bit down from Q3 sequentially, EPS. And in most years, Q4 is your strongest quarter. So is there anything specific going on or is that maybe just a little bit of conservatism?","Derrick A. Jensen","No. Actually, I would say that -- although recently, the fourth quarter has had some strong quarters, I mean, generally speaking, the fourth quarter for us has a tendency to trend down. I mean, the third quarter historically is always the highest quarter and then the fourth quarter has a tendency to trend down, both in revenue and in EPS, predominantly associated with weather-type effects. As we stand here today, I think the fourth quarter revenues can -- will trend down a little bit. They may end up being a little bit equal, but I think the margins themselves will continue to trend down like historically, based upon the seasonal impacts.","Operator","And next we'll move on to Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Jerimiah Booream-Phelps - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Jerimiah on the line for Vishal. I just wanted to touch on the breakdown between Canada, the U.S. and Australia, and any kind of color you can give there in terms of how that may be shifting or if there's any shift for you in your backlog specifically?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, this is Derrick. We continue to see Canada be a growing component of our business. And historical, those numbers were probably in the 10% range. But as we continue to see our current outlook, I think you're going to see Canada get up into the 15% and 20% range of our business. I think that the backlog is probably somewhat comparable, what you see backlogged in Canada being somewhat comparable to that percentage. Australia right now is probably still a relatively small percentage. It's under 5%, but as Jim said, the aspects of growth there are pretty solid. So with the acquisitions and the dynamics of that market, I think they will continue to grow. But as of now, I don't think I'd say that I anticipate it getting above anywhere a 5% range for at least the near term.","Jerimiah Booream-Phelps - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then obviously, on these large contracts you get some lumpiness and we saw that in this quarter. But you touched a little earlier on the potential to get back to record backlog levels. Is that -- given the project push-outs, is that something we would see in the back half of this year or early next year? Any color on that?","James F. O'Neil","I would just say that the overall trend is that we have the opportunity to be at record levels backlog again. I'm not going to say it's going to be next quarter or the quarter after. It's just difficult for us to predict that because of the timing and nature of awards. We -- the important thing is we're having discussions with customers. We are in their offices. We work for most of the investor-run utilities and Canadian utilities. We know what's in their capital programs going forward. And that leads us to believe that there is certainly opportunity to build backlog from here. But the timing of whether that happens next quarter or this year, into next year, it's just difficult to predict that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dan Mannes with Avondale Partners.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Couple of quick follow-up questions. I want to hone a little bit more on the second quarter and on the oil and gas business. I think, Derrick, in your comments, you mentioned maybe a little bit of a boost on closeouts. Could you maybe give us a little bit more granularity there? And then secondarily, can you maybe help us bridge from the second quarter, which had, I think, your best margins we've seen in a long time, to maybe a second half you when I think you'll have probably better utilization on mainline?","Derrick A. Jensen","Dan, I think when you said boost, I'm not sure if you're talking about oil and gas or electric power. Electric power we had a degree of negativity from some changes. But on...","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","No, oil and gas.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, I think oil and gas is what you're referring to, sets that [ph]. It's not job closeouts. It's just continuing to execute to contingencies on the job. Those jobs actually are still in progress. So there wasn't really any closeout. It's just the execution on the jobs such that we're able to continue to execute through contingencies and therefore, see a higher overall performance on the projects themselves. As it relates to the rest of the year within that segment, we see -- I think probably in the third quarter, we'll be able to be in the 9% to 12% range. And then when you're looking at the fourth quarter overall, we have some degree of seasonality expectations so that the range contemplates something that'd be below the 9% to 12% range, to something that may be still in the 9% to 12% range depending on seasonality.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","And then the follow-up there, as it relates to utilization, historically, you'd struggled a little bit on the mainline side. Sounds like that's getting better. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on where you are in terms of already contracted utilization as you work through the balance of this year versus maybe where you were in the first half or prior periods?","James F. O'Neil","Well, Dan, let me just say that all of our people are fully deployed in the shales right now doing gathering where we're not doing mainlines. So I would say that the utilization of our crews is very high. I think what we're doing is we've done a really good job of strategically positioning ourselves to where the -- when these mainline projects move to construction that we're able to mobilize on them going forward. And obviously, because of the nature of mainline, the contractual arrangements compared to gathering, those jobs will command higher margins. Like Derrick mentioned, if you can execute to those contingencies, those margins will fall to the bottom line and that's where you're going to get the bump in profits.","Operator","And next we'll move on to Will Gabrielski with Stephens.","Will Gabrielski - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Could you talk a little bit more about Australia as an opportunity and, I guess, your commitment there in the long run? And then specifically across both businesses, I look in the U.S., right, it's like scale, labor and equipment are big advantages. How do you transfer that into Australia?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I think it's the same thing. Scale, labor and equipment are a big advantage in Australia, and I think we pride ourselves on being first movers into areas that we believe will have significant infrastructure builds in the coming years. And there are a lot of dynamics in Australia that bode well for us to grow that business. Right now, we're doing coal seam gas in Queensland, which has got a 10-year run on it. That's where a significant part of our revenues come from today. They're privatizing utilities there. They've got an aging water and telecom infrastructure that needs to be rebuilt. The electric grid needs to be upgraded as well. It's similar age and condition as we see here in the States. You've got a large unconventional shale that's yet to be tapped into, the Cooper oil sands. That's really almost like being in the U.S. back in '08. There's a lot of development and activity that will occur there. So the mining business will return. There's electrification of those mines that needs to happen. Pipeline infrastructure needs to be put into place. So we believe this can be a $1 billion business for us over a period of time or we wouldn't be there. And we're building a service model that's very similar to what we have here in the States to execute on those opportunities.","Will Gabrielski - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then there's been some talk over the last few months about new entrants into North American transmission market, not just on the construction side but maybe even some of the bigger E&Cs getting in as owners, engineers or project managers. How do you work with them? Is there anything that's changing? And do you view that as a risk, opportunity or just more of the same?","James F. O'Neil","No, that doesn't change anything from our perspective. We're the largest contractor that has the specialized workforce to do the work on transmission and distribution in North America. And certainly, it doesn't really matter to us who's doing the engineering on those programs.","Operator","And we'll move on to Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was wondering, Derrick, if you could give us -- maybe you stated this or not -- but the amount of acquired backlog in the quarter, and maybe by segment, if you have it.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, during the quarter itself, we really didn't make any significant acquisition. So there was nothing there per se. But the CPP acquisition, which happened post-the quarter end, the backlog associated with it was roughly about -- probably about $50 million. But that was acquired post-June 30.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. Helpful. And then just on the cash flow here, Derrick, can you give us some help as to what you think the back end of the year might look like now that we're kind of progressing into that time period. Clearly, you've been making some investments and cash flow has been okay, but probably could maybe be a little bit better. Just wondering your thoughts on what you see in the next couple of quarters.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, I mean it's -- we don't project our cash flows publicly. They are quite volatile. Usually it's associated with the seasonality of the business and oftentimes what happens there in the fourth quarter. I do believe that we have the capabilities of having good cash flow still yet based upon the way things flow, more specifically, to the extent that we have revenues decline in the fourth quarter off the third quarter if that seasonal effect happens. That generally creates a pretty strong fourth quarter cash flow. So it's difficult for me to say -- call out anything specific, but I do think that we'll still be able to be positive free cash flow for the year.","Operator","And we'll move on to William Bremer with Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay, a lot of good color on -- especially on mainline as well as some of the shale work. Can we touch base on downstream, what the current market there is and what you're seeing? And then my follow-up question is just an update on your offshore activities.","James F. O'Neil","Yes, Bill, the downstream market is actually as active as the midstream and upstream and we actually are greenfield-ing opportunities in some of the Houston ship channel and some of the refineries and petrochemical plants. So we probably have. It's not material today, but we're certainly building that business, and they've got the same issues as the rest of the services that we provide, whether it's resource limitations. We actually have a company that does EPC substations in the downstream sector. We're also building our electrical service offerings to that sector. Offshore, the demand for our offshore services continues to increase. There's additional CapEx being deployed into deepwater. The shelf really hasn't slowed down the Gulf of Mexico. We fabricate and install production systems on offshore platforms. There's some mechanical hook-up work that we're doing, there's some redundant pipeline systems that are being built offshore, off the Eastern Seaboard. We're involved in 1 project which we, I believe, talked about in the past. So it's Williams -- we're working with Williams to do some work for National Grid off of New York State. So it's a very active environment right now. And we're real pleased with the progress we've made there and continue to see opportunities to grow that business.","Operator","And we will move on to Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Benjamin Xiao","This is actually Ben Xiao on for Jamie. You guys previously mentioned that C3 study, which predicts near-double-digit transmission growth through, I think, 2020. And you guys have previously expressed confidence about growing transmission double digits for at least 2 years. So are you guys becoming more confident that you can grow at double digits maybe beyond that?","James F. O'Neil","We haven't given guidance beyond our commentary that we see double-digit growth in 2015. Certainly, we'll plan to roll our commentary forward when we get comfortable to do so. There's a lot of puts and -- pushes and pulls, obviously, with permitting and siting. Our customer capital programs indicate that there will be that opportunity there with the spending that we expect over the next 5 years. But as far as us translating that into how that will affect us over any calendar year, we're not at that point yet to discuss that.","Benjamin Xiao","Okay. And then just a quick second one. Can you talk more about pricing in oil and gas and electric power relative to maybe 3 to 6 months ago? Has there been any improvement or is it still relatively stable?","James F. O'Neil","The pricing environment continues to be strong, and margins and backlog are comparable to what we're executing on today.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Craig Irwin with Wedbush Securities.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Jim, I wanted to ask you a big-picture question. So ahead of the huge upswing in activity that you've seen over the last several years in the electric T&D market, you guys were talking about it for a while, maybe for 1.5 years, maybe 2 years, you had excellent visibility from your customers that they were going to be doing projects. And that materialized. Can you maybe compare and contrast with the oil and gas and pipeline cycle that you're facing down now, how you see your visibility versus maybe where you stood in front of the electric T&D cycle? What gives you confidence these customers are moving forward with their projects and how you see this potentially as -- if you could shape it out versus the T&D cycle and how that materialized for us?","James F. O'Neil","Craig, that's an excellent point. And because of the discussions that we are having with customers, it feels very much the same as the late part of 2010 when we were about to impart on this construction, this transmission construction up cycle that we've seen over the last 3 years. And it's a very similar feeling with what we're seeing on mainline. And it's not just Quanta, it's the industry in general. It's all of the contractors and all of the customers. Because of these detailed discussions we've been having with them over the last year, because we all know there's a significant amount of work to be done and there's a limited amount of resources, and it's a very, very -- it's the same. It's the same. It's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu over again, but with the oil and gas sector, not the electric power transmission business.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","My second question is about the segment operating margins in the oil and gas segment. As you start to have a greater mix of construction over a longer portion of the year, in the winter and early spring, can you talk about what this could potentially mean for margins within that segment and whether or not the potential larger lines agreements that you're looking at would also have implications for operating margins in that segment as we model it out for the future?","Derrick A. Jensen","Craig, this is Derrick. Yes, as we've talked, the contribution of additional mainline work continues to give us confidence that on an annual basis, you'd be able to see margins in the 9% to 12% range. From the seasonal impact of that, it's a little difficult to say yet. We haven't gotten into looking at the quarter guidance of '15 to see as to whether we'd be in a spot where the -- that 9% to 12% would carry into, as an example, the first quarter, which is our seasonally lowest quarter. I would say that I still believe, as we stand here today, that the seasonality effects will generally still be such that the first quarter will be our lowest margins of a given period. But as to how that's going to translate directly into 2015, that's hard to say. From this year, I think that you'll see the third quarter continuing to be able to have the opportunity to be in the 9% to 12% range for that segment and then the fourth quarter seasonality, putting a degree of pressure on that. But long-term, we feel confident that all of the projects that Jim has talked as opportunities for us would continue to get us into an annual 9% to 12% operating performance.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Daniels - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Tom Daniels on for Brian. Maybe a quick question on the fiber optic business if I could. Very strong operating margin in that business. Revenue was down a tick year-over-year, but margins were very strong. Could you guys comment on that a little bit?","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure, I mean, the revenues are down because of the ancillary telecom business. We combined telecom revenues that are not associated with the fiber business together with our legacy fiber business. As it relates to the overall segment itself, we still see growth opportunities probably in the mid-single digit range. Predominantly in the long-term double-digit growth opportunities driven from our moving into the lit fiber market. From a margin perspective, I'd still say that we see margins in the 30% to 35% range. There's a little bit of fluctuation that occurs in that associated, as we've called out today, on the maintenance cost of the network. But I continue to expect margins likely in the 30% to 35% range as it states for now. In the near term, has the risk of it being a little bit lower because of the lit fiber dynamics as we start to roll that out, but in the long term, I still think that we'll feel comfortable that it'd be in the upper end of that range.","Thomas Daniels - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood, thanks. And then one question regarding your prepared remarks on the supply-demand dynamics in mainline and, potentially, demand outstripping supply. How do we think around the timeline of that? I know there's a lot of reversal work I think we're predicting over the next, kind of call it, 2 years in the U.S. but I imagine the dynamic is different in Canada. How do you think about supply-demand in Canada versus the U.S., and maybe which year do you expect the potential for demand to actually outstrip supply in each region?","James F. O'Neil","I think it just depends upon on how these projects lay out. So it could happen in '15 if things get -- projects lay out perfectly for the customers, perhaps you don't get that dynamic. But it could happen in '15, it could happen in '16. I'll just say there's a significant amount of work to our customers are concerned about it. The capacity in Canada is less than what -- significantly less than what the U.S. has, and certainly that's going to be a pinch point as well. So it's a multi-year phenomenon that can occur. It can be seasonal as well but certainly the contractors' ability to support customers is going to be challenged as customers move forward with their programs here over the next 2 years.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","James F. O'Neil","Well, I'd like to thank all of you for participating in our second quarter 2014 conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services.

Jim?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you, Kip, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Quanta Services' fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings conference call. I will start the call with a strategic and operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results. Following Derrick's comments we welcome your questions.","Our fourth quarter results, excluding unusual financial items, met our expectations, which I believe set the positive tempo as we close out what was a challenging year for the company and the overall industry. Many of the challenges we faced in 2015 resulted from factors outside of our control; such as the collapse in oil prices, and in particular its effect on the Canadian economy, several severe weather events, project delays due to a challenging permitting environment and a sudden shift in small transmission market dynamics, all of which impacted our topline margins and profitability.","However, there were things we should have done better. For example, the unusual occurrence of a significant project loss we incurred on the combined cycle gas power plant we are building in Alaska. That said, we've booked significant mainline pipe backlog in 2015 and expect additional mainline awards this year, which should be a catalyst for profitable growth for Quanta in 2016.","As we transition from a challenging 2015 into 2016, I believe, it is an appropriate time to review our strategies for long-term growth and competitive differentiation as well as discuss the near-term and longer-term drivers of the markets we serve. Though our end markets are experiencing some near-term challenges that create uncertainty, we believe uncertainty creates opportunity and we are actively pursuing strategic initiatives that we believe will lay the groundwork for success in the upcoming years.","A unique, but critical driver of Quanta's success is the decentralized and entrepreneurial business model that Quanta embraces. Since Quanta's IPO in 1998, we have completed nearly 200 acquisitions through which we acquired some of the best operators in our industries and strategically expanded into different geographies and service offerings. As a result, we believe, we have acquired the best entrepreneurial leadership and the largest skilled workforce in the markets we serve, which is the heartbeat of Quanta Services and the key to our ongoing success.","The combination of acquisitions and organic growth has allowed us to build a company with a comprehensive breadth of self-performed infrastructure solutions that we believe is unmatched in our industry. More than ever before our customers are seeking comprehensive solutions, safe project execution and cost certainty. With our scope and scale, industry-leading safety record, consistent project performance, as well as the largest specialized workforce in our industry, we believe Quanta is uniquely positioned to serve the expanding needs of our customers.","Another important differentiator is that we have significantly enhanced our engineering and project management capabilities to capitalize on market trends in our industry that we believe are shifting toward an engineering, procurement and construction or EPC model. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, in addition to our operational capabilities gives our customers the confidence that we can support their expanding needs.","As we look ahead to 2016 and beyond, our blueprint for success is three-fold. First, we must continue to exceed customer expectations in our core business. Delivering projects safely, on-time, and on budget.","Second, we intend to leverage our core business to expand in the complementary adjacent service lines and selectively expand into new geographies. This broadens the solutions we can offer our customers, provides growth opportunities and achieves operational diversity.","And third, we expect to continue to be opportunistic and explore new service lines, where we can acquire our leadership position and grow shareholder value over the long-term. Both organic initiatives and our acquisition program will continue to play an important role in achieving our long-term strategic growth objectives.","Now, I'd like to provide some near-term and longer-term color on our end markets and our segment expectations for this year. Last year was challenging for our Electric Power segment, and we expect some of those market headwinds to carry over into 2016. As a result, we expect Electric Power segment revenues may decline by low single digits in 2016 versus 2015. We will anticipate continued growth in sub-transmission and distribution work this year. We expect our volume of large transmission revenues to decline in 2016, particularly compared to the first half of 2015 as large project activity was fairly robust at that time.","However, we believe large transmission project delays due to regulatory and permitting headwinds are temporary and that growth could resume in the second half of 2016, although timing is uncertain. That said, we continue to have a positive multiyear outlook for the large transmission market, based on the projects we have in backlog, as well as future opportunities we're aware of and pursuing today.","With the exception of 2015, our Electric segment operating income margins have exceeded 10% in every year since 2008. Our 2016 guidance contemplates a range between 8% and 9% to reflect the current market challenges. We remain focused on returning this segment to historical operating income margin levels of at least 10%. We are in a complex fluid environment, where some of our markets are growing at record levels, while others are going through challenges.","We are proactively addressing these challenges by adjusting our cost structure where appropriate, by making head count reductions and by shifting equipment and facility strategies to adjust to the current market environment. This management team is committed to returning margins to historical levels. However, we are mindful not to compromise our core capabilities. We remain ready to capitalize on the larger, more complex transmission opportunities that we are pursuing.","That said, the end market drivers that underpin our positive multiyear outlook remain firmly in place. The North America power grid continues to age and reliability challenges continues to increase, despite the increased capital deployed into transmission and distribution upgrades during this decade. To that end, the C3 Group, an independent energy infrastructure and utility research organization estimates that $25 billion to $30 billion will be spent on transmission annually in North America through 2020.","Despite the Supreme Court's recent ruling to stay the EPA's Clean Power Plan, the North America power grid generation mix continues to shift away from coal to more natural gas and renewables and new technologies are being deployed creating a more advanced power grid, all of which require great expansions and enhancements. As a result, many of our key customers have robust capital programs underway focused on upgrading and expanding transmission and distribution infrastructure in the coming years.","Another longer-term driver of electric transmission is FERC Order 1000, though we did not expect the project delays resulting from our customers' adaptation to this newer regulation, we believe this is a short-term dynamic and expect FERC Order 1000 to drive significant incremental electric transmission investment in the future.","We believe some of FERC Order 1000 transmission projects could be larger in scope and scale than what the industry has experienced over the past several years; but as we have stated in the past, we do not believe these programs will move to construction in a meaningful way until at least 2017.","However, we have a strong base of large transmission projects in our backlog. The combined aggregate contract value of the Labrador Island Link HVdc transmission project and the Fort McMurray West transmission project alone is approximately $1.5 billion.","At year-end, the Labrador Island Link HVdc transmission project was approximately 22% complete, and the Fort McMurray West transmission project isn't expected to start construction until 2017 and should finish in 2019. We also have numerous strategic alliances with several customers that have robust multiyear electric transmission investment programs.","We believe our Oil and Gas segment outlook is also promising, as momentum continues to build, driven primarily by mainline and natural gas distribution and integrity markets. The mainline market is a very active environment and we expect significant mainline construction activity this year. So far in the first quarter we have either signed contracts or in the final stages of negotiations on approximately $400 million of additional mainline projects.","We currently have two mainline projects both in Canada that commence construction late in the fourth quarter and we expect a significant number of mainline projects to begin constructions over the next several quarters.","We expect most of the mainline activity over the next several years will be related to natural gas pipeline projects, driven primarily by coal to gas power generation switching and increasing demand from commercial and residential customers due to the low price and abundance of natural gas.","The natural gas mainline programs fall under FERC jurisdiction and therefore many have had fewer state permitting issues and approval delays. We have observed permitting delays on several oil mainline projects. We recently had one project delayed indefinitely due to state permitting issues and we have subsequently removed this project from our year-end backlog.","While an extended period of low oil prices could create challenges to mainline pipe projects, it is important to note that the delays we are seeing for oil mainline projects are predominantly due to extended state approval processes and not low oil prices.","We continue to attract billions of dollars of additional mainline pipe projects and we now expect more project activity in 2017 and 2018 than we did previously. We are working with several key customers to ensure that they have adequate resources to accomplish their capital program objectives, and we will remain disciplined on pricing and contract terms.","With respect to other key services we provide in the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulations should continue to drive opportunities in the natural gas distribution market as customer integrity programs continue to accelerate.","Many of our customers are seeking expanded service offerings, where we can provide program management and construction capabilities over larger replacement programs. We have expanded our customer footprint in both Canada and the United States because of this and expect growth opportunities to continue for the next several years.","We continue to expect challenges in areas of our business that are sensitive to the current low oil price environment, primarily in Australia, the Canadian oil sands and our offshore Gulf of Mexico operations. That said, we expect any incremental softness in these areas to be more than offset by the growth in mainline revenues this year and beyond.","As a result of these growth opportunities, we believe our Oil and Gas segment revenues can grow in the low-teens to mid-teens range this year. Margins in our Oil and Gas segment have improved each year since 2007 with the exception of 2015.","On our past conference calls, we have communicated to you that the proper complement of mainline pipe work and solid execution, we believe this segment should operate in the 9% to 12% operating income range, which we still believe to be true. However, our 2016 guidance reflects an operating income margin range for this segment of 5.5% to 7%. Several factors led us to project margins below the 9% operating range for this segment this year.","First, the volume of midstream gathering work is forecasted to be down significantly this year, due to the reduced rig count in North America, a prolonged oil price environment and bottlenecks with moving natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shales due to the lack of takeaway infrastructure are the primary cause.","Midstream gathering work has been a recurring revenue base that augmented our mainline pipe workforce, while mainline activities were at low levels. Until our mainline pipe projects ramp into construction, we forecast that near-term segment margins could be pressured.","Second, if mainline projects ramp up is expected this year, we will mobilize multiple spreads consisting of several thousand people and a complement of equipment in a very short period of time. We are being prudent with our margin expectations until these projects transitions, and are in full construction.","Finally, while we expect our operations that are impacted by the low price of oil to be profitable this year, it will be difficult for these businesses to generate margins higher than mid-single-digits, which will affect our overall segment margins.","We're aggressively taking steps to right size these operations to operate profitably in the current environment, which will be an ongoing process. As a result, we anticipate taking a $3 million to $4 million restructuring charge in the first quarter, which we have included in our 2016 guidance.","In summary, while we have experienced challenges in 2015, we expect profitable growth in 2016. Largely from contributions from mainline pipe construction and the non-recurrence of the meaningful project losses we have in 2015.","We believe the current dynamics impacting the Electric Power segment are short-term and we have significant projects in backlog and are also working with several customers on future large transmission project opportunities that will play out over a multiyear period.","During my 17 years here at Quanta, I have been through several market down cycles and in each situation \u2013 whether the telecom meltdown in 2001 and 2002, or the financial crisis in 2008 to 2009, Quanta has emerged to stronger better company with improved competitive position within the industry. I expect the same result as we move through our current industry challenges.","We continue to execute on strategies that position Quanta for both near-term and long-term growth and we are confident in our abilities to continue to deliver the customer-driven solutions that have made us the industry leader.","As we close out 2015 with this call, I want to thank our employees, who I believe are the very best in the industry and are the primary reason we consistently differentiate ourselves from our competitors in an ever-changing market environment.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review for our financial results. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $2.03 billion in the prior year's fourth quarter. Net loss from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $2.6 million or a loss of $0.02 per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $60.4 million or $0.27 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release, was $0.30 for the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $0.48 for the fourth quarter of 2014.","Our fourth quarter results were impacted by approximately $0.25 per diluted share of net impairment charges. These charges included asset impairments of $58.5 million or $0.27 per diluted share, primarily associated with goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges associated with lower forecasted oil and gas services revenues for our Gulf of Mexico operations and certain Australian operations, due to the extended low commodity price environment. These charges were partially offset by tax benefits of $4.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share, associated with the realization of a previously unrecognized deferred tax assets related to our investment in a foreign subsidiary.","Also, net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2014 was negatively impacted by a $30.3 million net of tax charge, or $0.14 per diluted share for a provision for long-term contract receivable associated with change orders on a 2012 electric power transmission project that were ultimately settled earlier this year.","Net loss attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $5.1 million, or a $0.03 loss per diluted share. This compares to net income attributable to common stock of $66.6 million, or $0.30 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014.","The decrease in consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our large electric transmission and mainline projects, which were adversely impacted by reduced customer spending and delays in project timing due to regulatory and permitting issues.","In addition, consolidated revenues were negatively impacted by approximately 2.5%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, when quantifying the estimated impact of changes in foreign exchange rates between the quarters. Partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of approximately $70 million in revenues generated by acquired companies, primarily in our Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment.","Our consolidated gross margin was 11.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to 15.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014. This decrease was primarily a result of the negative impact of lower revenues from mainline and large electric transmission projects, both of which typically carry higher margins than certain other types of projects.","Also impacting our gross margin for the quarter was $19.3 million of incremental project losses related to a power plant project in Alaska, which is expected to be completed in mid-2016. These incremental costs on the project were largely due to differences in build requirements versus the original engineering and we are pursuing specific engineering claims to recover a portion of these costs. However, the benefit of potential recovery on these claims has not yet been reflected in our estimates as of year-end.","Selling, general and administrative expenses, as presented in this quarter's earnings release, were $151.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting a decrease of $3.2 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. This decrease is primarily due to $6 million in lower salaries and benefits costs associated with the level of operations in 2015, partially offset by $3.5 million in higher professional fees.","Selling, general and administrative expenses, as presented in this release, as a percentage of revenues, were 8% in the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to 7.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the decline in revenues and its negative impact on the absorption of consolidated overhead costs.","To further discuss our segment results, Electric Power segment revenues were $1.29 billion, reflecting a decrease of $72.6 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 5.3%. Lower revenues were a result of reduced customer spending and delays in projects due to regulatory and permitting issues associated with large electric transmission projects.","Foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted revenues in this segment by approximately $31 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. These negative factors were partially offset by the contribution of approximately $25 million in revenues from acquired companies, as well as increased activities from smaller transmission and distribution projects.","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment decreased slightly to 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 7.4% in last year's fourth quarter. The decrease in margin was primarily due to the previously mentioned incremental loss recorded during the quarter on the power plant project, lower revenues from higher-margin large electric transmission projects, as well as a $6.6 million property and equipment impairment charge related to certain international renewable energy services operations.","Although these items negatively impacted the operating margins for 4Q 2015 for comparative purposes, the fourth quarter 2014 was also impacted by the previously mentioned charge to a provision for long-term contract receivables.","As of December 31, 2015, 12-month backlog for the Electric Power segment decreased 2.3%, and total backlog increased 1.2% when compared to September 30, 2015. The decrease in 12-month backlog was primarily due to burn on existing projects along with a negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.","Total backlog increased due to the inclusion of two Latin American telecom concession awards, as well as the estimated contribution to total backlog for the renewal of certain MSAs slightly offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.","Oil and Gas segment revenues decreased quarter-over-quarter by $55.8 million, or 8.4% to $607.8 million in 4Q 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of when large mainline projects move to construction as well as reduced demand for certain of our oil and gas services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending.","Also, changes in foreign currency translation rates negatively impacted revenues contributed by our international operations in this segment by approximately $19 million. Partially offsetting these decreases were revenue contributions of approximately $45 million from acquired companies as well as increased revenues from distribution services.","Operating income for the Oil and Gas segment, as a percentage of revenues, decreased to 3.9% in 4Q 2015 from 8.1% in 4Q 2014. This decrease in operating income is primarily due to a decline in mainline revenues, which typically yield higher margins as well as lower margins on those mainline projects actually under construction due to typical project variability. Also contributing to this decrease was lower demand for services associated with certain operations as a result of lower oil prices and permitting delays, which negatively impacted this segment's ability to cover fixed costs.","12-month backlog for the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment decreased by $184.7 million, or 8.9%, and total backlog decreased to $336.9 million or 9.9%, when compared to September 30, 2015. These decreases were due to the removal of a mainline project from year-end backlog that Jim referenced in his prepared comments, burn on existing contracts, as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange rates between the periods.","Corporate and unallocated costs increased $51.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 4Q 2014, as a result of the $51.9 million charge associated with the previously mentioned goodwill and intangible asset impairments.","Cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations for the year-ended December 31, 2015 provided approximately $618.2 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $183.8 million resulting in approximately $434.4 million of free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $15 million for the year-ended December 31, 2014.","The increase in cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations was partially due to decreased working capital requirements associated with a decrease in the number of large electric transmission jobs ramping up this year, as compared to last year; the receipt of approximately $87 million in a project prepayment for a project with production beginning in 2015; and the receipt of a $65 million cash payment for the Sunrise Powerlink project receivable in the first quarter of 2015. Also, cash flows related to discontinued operations for the fourth quarter of 2015 were negatively impacted by a payment of approximately $134 million associated with taxes payable from the gain on the sale of Sunesys.","DSOs were 75 days at December 31, 2015 compared to 85 days at September 30, 2015 and 84 days at December 31, 2014. This decrease is primarily due to the impact at December 31, 2015 of the inclusion of the $87 million project prepayment discussed previously and strong collections in the fourth quarter of 2015. DSOs at December 31, 2014 were negatively impacted by the inclusion of the $65 million Sunrise Powerlink project receivable and the impact of acquisition and working capital balances late in the fourth quarter of 2014, for which there were no material corresponding fourth quarter revenues.","Investing cash flows during the fourth quarter of 2015 were impacted by aggregate cash consideration paid of approximately $9 million, net of cash acquired, related to the closing of one acquisition in Canada during the quarter. Financing cash flows during the fourth quarter of 2015 came from net borrowings of $131.3 million under our credit facility, partially used to fund the repurchase of 3.6 million shares of our common stock for approximately $76.8 million.","To recap our share repurchase activity, we repurchased a total of 59.3 million shares for a value of approximately $1.46 billion during the year-ended December 31, 2015. We've also paid $150 million under an accelerated share repurchase arrangement, the ASR, entered into on August 10, 2015 for shares expected to be delivered upon final settlement of the ASR in April of this year.","At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $128.8 million in cash. At the end of the year, we had about $307 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments, and we have $466.9 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility.","As previously announced, we increased our credit facility in December 2015 to $1.81 billion and extended the maturity to December 2020. Favorable market conditions allowed us to maintain competitive pricing and structure, including increased capacity to fund operations outside of the U.S. As such, we opportunistically amended the credit facility with the increasing commitments providing for approximately $1.16 billion of liquidity, as of December 31, 2015.","Turning to guidance. Throughout 2015, we have evaluated whether or not providing quarterly earnings guidance is beneficial, given the short-term volatility that can occur due to the variability in project timing and other impact factors that impact earnings from period to period. As we move into 2016, we will only provide annual guidance and will adjust our expectations as we move through the year.","For the year-ended 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. This range contemplates Electric Power segment revenues ranging from a decline of around 5% at the low-end of our guidance to year-over-year revenues in the segment remaining flat at the high-end of our estimates, with the remaining difference in revenues coming from growth in Oil and Gas segment.","As it relates to seasonality, I would generally assume usual seasonality through the year, with the first quarter being the lowest with respect to revenues and margins. We would expect revenue and margin improvement sequentially in the second quarter; and again in the third quarter, with the third quarter being the strongest quarter of the year. I would assume revenues and margins in the fourth quarter fall somewhere between the second quarter and third quarter.","Of note, we expect a more pronounced difference between the quarters of 2016 than we have experienced in recent years. The slowing of the Canadian economy, reduced activity in the Canadian oil sands and the timing of project starts has reduced the seasonal offsets or flattening that Canadian revenues have provided in the first quarter and second quarter over the past few years.","This, coupled with lower and large electric transmission and mainline project revenues compared to the first quarter of last year causes us to estimate that our first quarter revenues could potentially decline up to 10%.","On the other hand, we expect a sizable ramp in revenues in the third quarter as we expect a significant number of mainline projects to begin moving to construction in the second and third quarters of this year. For 2016, we believe margins will continue to be at levels lower than our historical expectations with Electric Power somewhere in the 8% to 9% range, and Oil and Gas margins between 5.5% and 7%.","Jim commented in his prepared remarks, as to the primary factors affecting these margin estimates. In addition, largely due to ramp in revenues, I spoke of earlier, we expect margins to reflect a fair degree of seasonality with a more pronounced effect through the year in oil and gas, due largely due to the timing of mainline projects starts.","Our markets remain in a fluid environment with some areas of our business growing and others having challenges. As it relates to recent actions taken by management to improve margins, we've made head count adjustments at our corporate office as well as various operating units, as further evidenced by the restructuring costs associated with our offshore operations expected in the first quarter. The shutdown of our Middle East operations, which led to the fourth quarter tax benefit, as well as the rightsizing of our international operations, which included the impairment of certain renewable energy assets in the fourth quarter. These are just a few examples of our focus on adjusting the business to return margins to our target levels.","We would estimate that interest expense will be between $15 million and $20 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for 2016 to be between 36.5% and 37.5%. Also our annual 2016 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange rate environment, continuing movement of foreign exchange rates in the future could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and cause actual financial results to differ from guidance.","For purposes of calculated diluted earnings per share for the 12 months ended 2016, we are assuming 156.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our estimates include a projective reduction of approximately 10 million shares in April of 2016, which is the estimated settlement date of the ASR program and when final settlement of the required shares to be delivered is anticipated to take place. There are many factors that can influence our estimate of the final number of shares anticipated to be delivered under the ASR program, including an auction and further fluctuations in the stock price.","We currently anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.30 and $1.50 and anticipate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.58 and $1.78.","Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release. CapEx for all 2016 should be approximately $200 million to $220 million, this compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million.","Despite the challenges we experienced in 2015, we have several significant accomplishments that financially position us well for the future. The sale of our fiber optic licensing operations unlocked significant value and generated significant after-tax proceeds. Along with these proceeds, we utilized record free cash flow and availability under our credit facility to repurchase nearly $1.5 billion of our common stock in 2015 and an additional $150 million has been paid under the ASR, which effectively recapitalize our balance sheet and improved our cost of capital.","In addition, we increased the capacity and extended the maturity date of our senior secured revolving credit facility, increasing liquidity to assist in achieving strategic objectives that we believe will continue to generate shareholder value.","We closed 11 acquisitions during 2015 for an aggregate consideration consisting of $110.4 million in cash and $10.1 million in securities, which enhance our Electric Power and Oil and Gas Infrastructure Service capabilities. We expect to continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility and be positioned for continued internal growth and to execute on strategic initiatives.","Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with the focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and the repurchase of Quanta stock.","This concludes our formal presentation. And we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take the first question from Dan Mannes from Avondale Partners. Please go ahead.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Hello. Can you hear me?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah, good morning, Dan.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Great. The first question relates to backlog in the Oil and Gas segment. Backlog obviously down sequential, if I rewind to the Q3 call, you guys talked about $1 billion worth of mainline opportunities that were in discussions. Now, you're talking about $400 million in backlog is down, so I'm wondering either did something \u2013 how material was the project that you removed alternatively were some of the things you were negotiating before they have been pushed out?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","I would characterize the environment, Dan, continues to be robust. There's still billions of dollars of pipe mainline opportunities that are out there that we're bidding. The project that we removed from backlog was sizable. I'm not going to quantify it, but it was a sizable project. And that did impact the fourth quarter backlog decline obviously in oil and gas.","But with that said, I think it's just a short-term dynamic and I think backlog in that segment and quite frankly in both segments will continue to be strong going forward. We're going to have some seasonality baked in and some fluctuations that do occur, but some of the contracts are taking a little bit longer to negotiate, but we do expect the mainline backlog to continue to increase over time.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Got it. And then just switching over to the Electric segment, you talked about \u2013 maybe hope for an improvement in the second half. Is that based on large projects actually moving into construction in the second half? Or is that more a better bidding environment in the second half of 2016 on large projects leading to revenue in 2017?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","It's a little bit of both, Dan. We do expect to see more large project activity as we move into the second half of this year. We anticipate that. Although our visibility still isn't crystal clear. But, we do expect both backlog \u2013 the margin environment to improve and backlog \u2013 opportunities for backlog in large projects to improve as well.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Sounds good. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Okay. We'll now take the following question from Tahira Afzal from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you and congrats on a good quarter in a difficult environment.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you, Tahira.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Jim, first question is, can you give us an idea of how much you're expecting the shale business to fall-off. We are estimating in the model that we built for you something fairly dramatic. I would love to get a sense to just see how conservative or how balanced you're being there?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Most of our shale activity was in the Northeast in the Marcellus and in the Utica. The problem is, because the gas is trapped there is not enough takeaway capacity. There have been fewer wells being drilled, because they can't get the gas out.","And so, subsequently there is less gathering work to be done. I do think that problem will take care of itself, once we start building takeaway capacity. But, we are expecting levels of gathering to be down significantly this year compared to what we've seen in the past few years.","I would guess probably half the volume. But, the segment revenues should still grow, because we do think our LDC markets and our mainline markets will grow and make-up for that downturn. But, it does create some volatility and earnings in particular, when you haven't ramped up significantly in mainline...","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","...so we were using \u2013 that was a good stable baseline of work that we were doing on gathering that was recurring revenue year-round. That's now at a lower level. So, it's going to have some impact on margins until we ramp-up on mainline in a meaningful way.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it, okay. And then on the transmission side Jim, you know, the optimism again and maybe I'm asking same question as Dan in a sense. But the ramp you expect potentially in the second half, let's say you don't see it. What would the variations from your current forecast be, if you assume no ramp, or no new large projects in the second half?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, let me just be clear, we have very little uncommitted for large transmission projects at the midpoint of our guidance.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Perfect.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","So, I mean, I think that's enough said there. I mean, I don't think we're getting too optimistic in our transmission forecast. When we say we expect it to ramp, qualitatively, that really isn't baked in at the midpoint of our guidance, because I don't have the visibility. If it does begin to ramp in, we do better than we expect. It'd be more toward the upper end of our guidance, but we're not betting on it right now...","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Perfect.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","...because of our past history and trying to predict transmission. It's just difficult with the permitting challenges and so forth at this point in time to try to predict what's going to happen in the second half of the year.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then Derrick congrats again, Jim.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Okay. Thanks, Tahira.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, please limit yourself to asking one question. The next question will come from Matt Duncan from Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Morning, Matt.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","So, Jim, the first question, I want to go back to the question about the project that was taken at backlog. I appreciate you guys don't want to size that for obvious reasons. So, let me ask you a little bit differently, would that segment's backlog has been down, had you not remove that project?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes. It would have been down.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then in terms of the funding constraints that we're all hearing and seeing on the MLP side, can you quantify the impact on you guys that you're anticipating within your guidance from some of the funding issues that may crop up in that midstream segment?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. I don't know if it's necessarily a funding issue. I think that the low price of oil has obviously been a headwind to \u2013 there is not as many wells being drilled. I mean, the rig count is down 75% throughout North America. And we've taken that into account on our guidance that we'll be doing less gathering going forward.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Okay.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Matt, maybe, you should re-ask the question. I just didn't \u2013 I don't understand when you say funding.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Well, I mean, there is \u2013 the potential at MLP is just not going to have the money to spend. So...","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","I see.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","...if you have money to spend on this kind of stuff, how much are you...","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","(46:54)?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","No, I understand. I think we've baked that in. I mean, obviously, that's something we're watching very closely. And most of our customers fortunately are well capitalized that have committed contracts, and these are larger pipeline players. But, no, that is certainly something that we are watching \u2013 credit risk on some of the MLPs \u2013 and we have certainly baked that into our guidance.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Okay.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you for that clarification.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","And then a last thing, and I'll hop back into queue. Just on the Oil and Gas segment margin guide, I mean, you normally anticipate 9% to 12% there. Mainline work is the highest margin work you do there. That's the piece that's growing. Yet, the margin guide is 5.5% to 7%.","So, I'm trying to better understand the drag on segment margins from the underutilization of people in other parts of your Oil and Gas segment versus how much you're anticipating the mainline margins to maybe be below what they normally are, as you ramp on some of these larger projects. And due to the uncertainty of permitting and timing and the carrying cost of your people and equipment in that mainline segment, can you just better help us understand how come we're seeing so much of a margin drag there?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","That's a good question. And because we don't have the level of gathering work going on at this point in time in the Canadian pipelines that we typically would see the level \u2013 I mean, we are building some pipeline in Canada right now, but the level of activity isn't \u2013 what it has been in the past \u2013 we're not at a ramp level now on mainline.","So, the first half of the year will be a drag on margins. When we do have a full complement of mainline going in the second quarter or, particularly, in the third quarter, we should see us moving into that 9% to 12% range, if we execute. But for the full-year, we expect it to be a drag, primarily, because of the lack of gathering work that we've done over the last several years.","And also, we've got about 15% of our business that has been impacted directly by oil prices where we have operations that will be generating \u2013 we expect them to generate positive margins, but certainly nowhere near that 9% to 12% range. And the area is impacted by oil and gas. So, when you look at the entire segment and the dynamics that are occurring today, we feel like it will be challenging to be in that 9% range.","But that is our expectation long-term, and we're going to continue to make adjustments and certainly if mainline takes off like we expect in the next several years, we do think it's possible to get into that range at some point in time. But this year is going to be challenging.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the color, Jim. That helps.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah.","Operator","Right. Ladies and gentlemen, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. The next question will come from (sic) Noelle Dilts, Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Noelle Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning, Noelle.","Noelle Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning. You talked about moving into adjacent markets and taking advantage of the turmoil in the markets to some extent. Just want to understand, is this a meaningful shift in your acquisition strategy? That's one question.","Are you looking at staying within these energy-focused industries or do you look to move outside of that? Just give us a feel for what you're thinking and then also maybe touch on, if you're still looking at smaller bolt-on acquisitions or would maybe look at doing something larger?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Right now, our strategy is to do the bolt-ons in adjacent markets in our energy segments. That's what we've been focused on the last couple of years, building, for example, our engineering and material management capabilities in the both Oil and Gas and in the Electric segments.","We've moved into areas like storage, made a small bolt-on acquisition in the storage space. So, those are more adjacencies to help expand our customer solutions across the spectrum of what we can do. We're concentrating on our base business and execution right now. That's the most important thing.","And then certainly, we've done some bolt-on acquisitions in the last couple of years. I expect that to continue. But, I wouldn't count out doing \u2013 and again this is not our focus right now, but we do continue to look at opportunities in other areas, if that makes sense. And we're not going to make any big bad acquisition that's not my intent, but certainly if there's opportunities to move into other areas, we will. For example, in Latin America, we've been focused on expanding our telecom operations. And we should do about $300 million there this year. And so, that's an important growth opportunity for us and that's an example of branching out into new areas.","Operator","And we'll now take the next question from William Bremer from Maxim Group. Please go ahead.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Good morning, gentlemen.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Morning, Bill.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Morning, Bill.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Hey, Jim, can you give us maybe an update on what you're seeing on the downstream market? You touched upon midstream, what do you see in there in downstream?","And secondly one for you Derrick, you called out $3 million to $4 million of restructuring for the first quarter, what's the game plan for full 2016? And how do you right-size, I guess, Quanta overall here as, if we stay in this stagnantation type of level for quite some time now?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah, I'll go first. I mean the downstream market right now is extremely bullish \u2013 we're extremely bullish on them. I mean we've been green-fielding operations in the Houston ship channel and the refinery and petro-chem area and that business has been growing nicely for us. It's not anything material to the total company, but it's certainly a nice growth area for us.","And the business is going very strong right now. Obviously, with the refineries many of them operating at peak capacity and having expansion plans and at a very minimum, they are refurbishing and upgrading their existing facilities. So, we're doing really well there and we continue to see that as a growth area for us.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Relative to the cost, I mean, our efforts to right size costs are generally continuous, and so you rarely see us come through and have an aggregate restructuring type item. We've called that out relative to the first quarter. Not having any other forecast of other restructuring through the end of the year, doesn't mean that we're not trying to look at it from addressing those costs, but we're not looking at as it stands here today as having something that is a sizable overall restructuring.","We still are positioning ourselves relative to our multiyear outlook. We have a number of initiatives that's going on, in our mind that are to support the long-term growth of the company. And from a timing perspective, as it stands, as Jim mentioned, from what we see relative to the contributions of mainline in the third quarter and fourth quarter as well as the potential dynamics of evaluating what the market looks like in the last half of the year for a large transmission, we're still situating ourselves to support those aspects of the market as it stands today.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Okay, gentlemen. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. We'll now take the next question from Andrew Kaplowitz from (sic) Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, guys.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Morning.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Jim, you've talked about the expectation for low-teens to mid-teens revenue growth in 2015 in the Oil and Gas business. And while your total Oil and Gas backlog is still up in double-digit nicely, your 12-month backlog given. So, could you talk about your conviction in this kind of growth in 2016? And how dependent is your revenue forecast I mean on projects that aren't booked yet?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","We had a hard time with the caller here. It's breaking up. I think the question was my conviction on Oil and Gas segment in the backlog and I would \u2013 go ahead, I can hear you better now. Please repeat the question.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. It's very simply that how dependent is your revenue forecast in Oil and Gas based on mainline projects that aren't in backlog yet?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","We've got \u2013 in our forecast on mainline, I would say, that with the projects that we have at backlog at year-end, plus the projects that I mentioned that we have either signed or that we are negotiating \u2013 in the final stages of negotiating right now, that that would be the midpoint of our guidance and we have put some hedge in there for some project slippage as well.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","If that was your question?","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, that was the question. And so, let me just ask you about the pricing environment, especially in Canada. One of the concerns we have is that, even the competitive environment has been leading to contractors bidding on projects with less favorable terms. How, Jim, is that a concern, again, especially in Canada right now?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. I would say that on the \u2013 the pipeline side right now, nothing has changed if anything, it's a better environment for us, because we are still in the strategic alliances that are more risk sharing agreements that are longer-term, where the customer is wanting us to meet their resource needs over a multi-year period.","And that tends to be a more teaming type approach on the contracts and not a bid and buy situation at year-end when it's a one-off project. So, I would say, there's been no change in the overall approach to contract and all the risks that we're willing to take in this environment, even in Canada, because there's so much pipeline work to be built going forward.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And the same, electric transmission, Jim?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Electric transmission, I would say, there's \u2013 yeah, I mean, it's more challenging in Canada right now, because there's fewer projects out there. So, it just is a more challenging environment. Canada is a challenge right now, but we do think that it will recover, but it's going to be a difficult 2016 in Canada.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from John Rogers from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Hi. Good morning.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Morning, John.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Morning, John.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Good morning. Jim, just back on the pipeline business for a second, the improvement that you're expecting, both in bookings and margins into the second half, how much oil work is in those assumptions, or is it all gas? And give us a little color there.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","It's not all gas, but it certainly predominantly gas. And most of it frankly is moving gas in the Midwest and Northeast markets and in Eastern Canada. And we're also in the \u2013 we're along the eastern seaboard, in general. So, not to say, there's projects in the Southeast as well. So, it's mostly natural gas, I would say probably two-thirds to maybe three-quarters. I think that would probably the breakdown.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And the \u2013 I mean, there's a lot of reports about a number of these big projects going forward. But, we haven't yet seen a lot of contract awards, but we're seeing schedules that they're expected to start up by May, June of this year. When do these projects have to go into contract to meet those schedules?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, I mean, when the projects can move quickly to construction once contracts are signed. Projects can move quickly to construction once contracts are signed. And I don't think you're going to get a lot of pre-notification. It's just, I think \u2013 I mean, I just don't think there's going to be a lot of talk about what projects we're looking at and what the opportunity is, until we actually sign a contract and move to construction.","So, it's not unusual, I've been hearing about a lot of projects moving, but you don't hear a lot from contractors about those projects until they move to construction. That's the approach we're going to take. But, certainly there are several projects that we are working on, that we've been awarded, that we plan on moving to construction on in the second quarter and third quarter, in particular.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take the next question from Jeff Volshteyn from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sangita Jain - JPMorgan Securities LLC","This is Sangita for Jeff. My question is about the Gulf of Mexico impairment charge that you took in the fourth quarter. Can you tell us, if you would need to take another charge in 2016, let's say, if oil prices stayed at $30? And also about your Alaska power project, if you think you booked most of the loss that you need to or can we see more of it in 2016? Thanks.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","I'll tell you that when we looked at our forecast in the area \u2013 for the companies in the areas that are impacted by oil and gas. At our midpoint, we took oil prices that are in the current environment, we didn't take the models from any of these third-party firms, let's say, oil is going to be at $40 by the end of the year.","So, we're saying our base case is, this current environment extended. So, I hope we don't have to take \u2013 I think we're hopefully done with the impairments, because we feel like we're right sized in our forecast or geared toward the current environment that we live in today extended over a longer period of time. And then the second question?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, relative to the MLP, I'll add just a bit of color also to Jim's comment that is, when we evaluated our impairments, we didn't look at it as a base case; but at the same time, we looked at various scenarios including low cases and we waited those things accordingly to ensure that we had adequately taken into consideration potential volatility in this space.","And then as well as relative to MLP, we have gone through and like we do at every period when it comes to looking at revenue recognition and try to go through and look at what our estimates to complete are based upon what we believe is the probable outcome. And so, as we sit here today, we have gone through and done a bottoms-up approach; and from that end, we believe that as we sit here that we have booked everything, it was a probable loss on that project as of year-end.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","A little more color on MLP, I mean if there was some unforeseen conditions that required some engineering and scope changes, and we do feel that we have a good case to pursue, we are covered for a significant amount of that. Certainly, the most important thing right now is to get that project completed and it's scheduled to complete in the second quarter of this year.","Sangita Jain - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. Can I ask a follow-up on free cash flow and your potential use for that? If you plan, if you have a share buyback program beyond your ASR for the rest of the year, or if you plan to hold on to your free cash flow for acquisitions?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, actually, we have a fairly limited amount available under our current program based upon stock repurchases we made for 2015, we only have about $50 million remaining under our current program.","If we were to pursue anything relative to additional repurchases, we will need to have further board authorization which we do not have as we stand here today. When we look at free cash flow for 2016, I do expect to have a fair amount of draws of working capital to support the growth as we go into the second quarter and third quarter that Jim has spoken to.","So, I actually would tell you that I would expect to have a very limited free cash flow into the first portion of this year and it all basically dependent upon how the fourth quarter goes from seasonality, because again, most of it would be there to support the overall growth.","Sangita Jain - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. I guess a couple questions. One, I guess, I'm still trying to reconcile the margin guidance for E&P for 2016 versus 2015. If you take out the noise that you had in 2015 and assume a more normalized margin, 2016 I guess, just seems late to me. So, can you just help me understand what you're assuming in terms of large transmission mix in 2016 versus 2015, or is it more competitive pressures?","And then, I guess, the follow-up would be, Derrick, I think or Jim, last quarter you guys talked about, if you didn't see business picking up, you could take a \u2013 you would be a little more assertive on the cost cutting front; and in a sub-optimal topline market, you could sort of get to the 10% margin, what would you need to see to be more aggressive on the cost cutting side to improve margins? Like if those large transmission projects don't pick up in the back half of the year like you are expecting, should we expect restructuring? And at what point would you take those projects out of backlog?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Jamie, that's a good question. And we will continue, we have and we'll continue to make adjustments. And yeah, I mean, if transmission doesn't materialize in the second half, we expect margins to continue over time to get back to the 10% range.","I mean Canada is a big issue right now. Canada is challenged. We do have less big projects going on right now, especially compared to the first half of last year. And in the mix of smaller projects, the larger projects are certainly back to levels that we had in 2010.","With that said, we have significant amount of transmission in backlog that we will need to execute on in 2017. We have to maintain some of our core capabilities and not be shortsighted. We've got that large project, the (67:15) project that we've got to execute on, the concession move we won in Alberta; and again, we're very early still on the (67:26) and we expect other awards to come out that will be sizable in the coming years.","And so, I don't want to be shortsighted and cut all of our capabilities, but we do have a sense of urgency to return margins to historical levels. And we'll continue to make necessary adjustments, we have, and we'll continue to make necessary adjustments to improve margins over time.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take the following question from Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. This is Chad Dillard on for Vishal.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. So, if I take your 12 months backlog and compare it to the midpoint where you've got to get about $2.5 billion that needs to be booked. So, I was just curious to get your sense on like what sort of \u2013 like when would you need to actually book these projects to hit your guidance?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Well, I mean, I don't think there's any one answer to that. I mean I think we book backlog every day. And we've taken that into account when we evaluate our own committed business and everything that we do. The day-to-day book and burn work and the large spot project environment.","I think one of the key things that I mentioned today is that on your more volatile projects, where backlog is \u2013 you have the less visibility on backlog or your larger projects and we've assumed very little uncommitted electric transmission large projects at the midpoint of our guidance and we're comfortable that we have on the mainline guidance at the midpoint that we have the work booked or either in 12-month backlog, recently booked in the first quarter or that we're in final negotiations on projects and that's your midpoint.","And so, I think the other work is really book and burn work in areas of our business that have been accelerating over the last several years and we don't expect any change in the sub-transmission business or electric distribution and our LDC business.","All of that, it equates to probably half of our consolidated revenues and that businesses continues to accelerate and that's your day-to-day work that you probably have less committed, but you book that every day and that momentum continues as well.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And how should we think about operating cash flow in 2016? Can you just talk about what contributions from working capital you do expect as well as any advanced payments that we should be aware of?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, my earlier commentary I think was that based upon the fact that we do have such a seasonable ramp; we do think we'll have the draw of capital out of the business to support that growth. I think that you'll see the levels of debt continuing to increase on average balances between the first quarter into the second quarter, and into the third quarter, as we set up to fund the working capital that would be required to maintain that growth.","Fourth quarter is going to be highly dependent. I mean, it's normal seasonality that sets the fourth quarter would roll down some and would, therefore, be a strong cash flow period much like you saw in the fourth quarter of this year. But the timing of when that can happen is very difficult to predict. I do believe that ultimately we'll have free cash flow, but I think you'll see most of it being very backend loaded and highly seasonality dependent.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take the last question from Justin Hauke from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess, the parting question would be \u2013 the commentary on oil and gas, I mean, we've talked a lot about 2016. It sounds like the guidance is mostly supported by the backlog you already have plus the bookings in the first quarter.","I guess, I'm thinking, longer-term, as we look into 2017, I mean, how dependent is growth in that business on production levels? And the reason why I ask is, we see a lot of reports that show at the current production levels that there is not a lot of need for incremental pipeline in most of the shales, and we've got natural gas storage kind of at-capacity here. So, I mean, is that a business that can continue to grow after 2016?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes. I mean, I think, we will continue to book backlog. The takeaway capacity is needed, whether it's oil or natural gas. There's some markets that you hear that they don't need pipeline, I can certainly understand that in some of your liquid play shales. But we have customers that have a need to move liquids out of regions to either refining centers or load centers.","And in this environment, it actually reduces the cost, because they cannot move enough product by pipe, it's stranded, they're having to move it by rail, and rail looks really costly right now in this environment. So, both liquid \u2013 there's a need for liquid and natural gas takeaway capacity and you will continue to see backlog grow in those areas.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So, I guess the takeaway is, even if we see aggregate production levels come down, pipeline capacity can still grow?","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","In certain regions you'll see pipeline capacity grow...","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","James F. O'Neil - Chief Executive Officer and President","...or the needs for pipeline capacity, right from the Canadian oil sands, there is a desperate need to build takeaway capacity by our customers.","James F.

Jim?","James F. O'Neil","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with an operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","Before I begin my overview, I'll comment that any references to financial results in my prepared remarks have been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations.","2012 was a record year for Quanta. Our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results reflect strong demand for our services and continued solid project execution. For the full year, revenues increased 41%, and GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 143%. Our 12-month backlog was near record levels, and total backlog was at record levels as of December 31, 2012.","Our employee count at the end of this year's fourth quarter was approximately 17,800, up 15% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We are in a dynamic environment where Quanta is recognized as the industry leader in providing energy infrastructure solutions to our customers. We are also the employer of choice and continue to retain and attract exceptional people into our organization.","Despite working nearly 10 million more work hours in 2012 than 2011, we reduced our lost time incident rate by 17%, which demonstrates our commitment to safety and the high quality of our workforce. These factors contributed to organic revenue growth exceeding $1 billion in 2012, or an increase of approximately 36%.","We believe we are in the early stages of a multiyear build-out of energy infrastructure in North America and remain well-positioned to maintain our leadership role in the industries we serve. We will continue to leverage this leadership position and execute our strategic initiatives to grow both organically and selectively through acquisition, as we actively pursue opportunities to expand solutions to our customers and further differentiate Quanta from our competition.","Effective January 1, I promoted Duke Austin to Chief Operating Officer to lead the pursuit of these strategic initiatives and to lead our organization into the future. Duke brings over 25 years of experience in the markets we serve and is the fourth generation of his family serving the electric power industry. I'm very pleased to have Duke in this extremely important role.","We continue to build momentum in our Electric Power segment during the fourth quarter. We were in construction on a record 14 large electric transmission projects with contract value averaging over $200 million throughout North America. We were just as active on smaller transmission projects as customers continue to upgrade existing transmission infrastructure to comply with NERC reliability standards.","Our electric distribution revenues grew near double-digit rates for the full year of 2012 as our customers' focus on reliability has been heightened due to the storm events impacting the United States over the past 2 years.","During the quarter, our emergency restoration service revenues were approximately $130 million, driven primarily by Hurricane Sandy, which impacted the Northeast United States. More than 8 million homes lost power due to this devastation, and Quanta deployed more than 800 crews to 12 states in the District of Columbia to assist with the power restoration efforts. Preplanning with our customers in the days before Hurricane Sandy made landfall allowed us to position the majority of our resources in impacted areas well advance of the storm, enabling us to begin restoring possible as soon as it was safe to work. Our employees had no serious safety incidents despite working more than 40,000 man-hours in an extremely challenging environment. I want to congratulate our crews for their commitment to safety and thank them for their dedication to restore power to the victims of this catastrophe.","While emergency restoration revenues positively impacted our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results, our record results in 2012 were also driven by strong performance in our Electric Power segment due to the significant volume and solid execution of electric transmission projects underway. Excluding emergency restoration revenues in each period, Electric Power segment revenues grew approximately 39% in 2012 over 2011.","The electric utility industry continues to drive initiatives to improve the reliability of North America's electric transmission and distribution system and to interconnect new generation sources. We continue to believe that transmission spending will remain robust for at least the next several years and likely beyond, driven by reliability mandates, switching generation from coal to gas and the interconnection of new and existing renewable generation facilities.","Turning to our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment. Revenues increased substantially in 2012 as compared to 2011. More importantly, operating income increased $139 million year-over-year, primarily due to our strategic shift over the last 18 months to capitalize on shale infrastructure opportunities throughout the United States and Canada. We expect demand for our pipeline shale gathering services to remain active in 2013. Our customers continue to execute development programs in liquid-rich shales at a fast pace, and insufficient gathering pipeline infrastructure in many of these areas remains a bottleneck to efficiently transport product to market and processing areas.","We are in active discussions with several customers and believe a meaningful volume of large-diameter, long-haul pipeline or mainline projects will be awarded over the next several quarters. We believe several of these projects could move into construction in the second half of 2013 and beyond. We expect an improved mainline market environment in 2014, one that the industry has not seen for several years. We will continue to gain more clarity on industry dynamics and the progress of mainline projects over the next few months.","In our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment, revenues for the year increased 12%, primarily due to the growth in providing telecommunication infrastructure services to non-telecom customers. Our fiber licensing contract sales within this segment increased at a healthy double-digit growth rate for the year. The increase in contract sales in 2012 leads us to believe that Fiber Optic Licensing revenues could increase in the double-digit range in 2013. However, as telecommunication work is no longer a strategic priority, we anticipate other telecom revenues will likely decline, offsetting any increases in Fiber Optic Licensing revenues.","Turning to our outlook for 2013. The midpoint of our guidance indicates modest year-over-year growth after adjusting record 2012 emergency restoration revenues of $250 million to normalized levels of $100 million for our 2013 forecast. In addition, our guidance takes into account several factors. First, consistent with last year, our guidance takes into account potential delays in future electric transmission projects awards that may come into construction in the second half of this year. There are a number of large electric transmission projects that we expect will be awarded over the coming months that we believe we are well positioned to receive. However, a challenging and uncertain regulatory environment can cause delays in project awards and project starts. We believe transmission spending remains strong and will continue over the next several years. As we have indicated in the past, the timing of large electric transmission project awards can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. However, adjusting for a more normalized contribution of emergency restoration services, the higher end of our expectations contemplate potential double-digit revenue growth in Electric Power revenues if project awards do in fact materialize.","The second factor is the approach we have taken towards forecasting our Electric Power segment operating margins for 2013. In 2012, we generated 12.4% operating income margins in the Electric Power segment, which resulted in margins for the year above our prior 9% to 12% expectations. Three major factors contributed to our margin success: stellar execution, good weather throughout the year and a record storm year. Our guidance reflects the midpoint of our 9% to 12% operating margin segment expectations.","And finally, in our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment, we have no uncommitted mainline construction revenues in our guidance for 2013. While we believe mainline project construction is possible in the second half of this year, we will not include any projects in guidance until we have a signed contract and a firm construction start date, which is consistent with the approach we established last year.","We have taken a different approach to forecasting uncommitted shale gathering revenues in 2013. Last year, we did not forecast uncommitted shale gathering revenues because we were working with new customers in new markets. This year, we are forecasting enough uncommitted shale projects so that shale revenues for the full year of 2013 are comparable to 2012. We transitioned to this approach because shale gathering contracts, although quickly booked and burned, have been similar to master service agreements, where the customer contracts have been relatively consistent and repeatable. We will continue to strive to perform at levels seen in 2012. And as the year progresses, we will evaluate all factors and their influence on our expected financial performance.","In summary, 2012 was Quanta's best year ever. While we are proud of our accomplishments in 2012, we are focused on the future and continue to implement strategic initiatives to position Quanta for near-term and long-term profitable growth. We could not have accomplished what we did in 2012 without our dedicated employees who are the very best in the industry. We believe we are in the early stages of a significant multiyear energy infrastructure investment cycle, and that the demand for Quanta Services provide -- remains robust for at least the next several years. Our total backlog is at record levels, and our 12-month backlog is at near record levels despite the significant revenue growth we experienced in 2012. We are confident that Quanta can continue to safely execute current and future projects for our customers, and we look forward to reporting our progress to you as we move through 2013.","I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our Chief Financial Officer, for his financial review of the fourth quarter. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the results of the quarter, I'll remind everyone that on December 3, 2012, we sold our telecommunications subsidiaries, which comprised substantially all of our domestic telecommunications infrastructure services operations. We have presented these as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for the current and prior periods. As such, the amounts presented in our earnings release and discussed in my following comments do not compare to our previous SEC filings, which have not been adjusted to reflect these discontinued operations. However, for comparative purposes, we have posted certain prior-period information on our website reflecting these discontinued operations. I will discuss the impact of the transaction on our fourth quarter results later in my presentation.","Today, we announced revenues of $1.67 billion for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $1.39 billion in the prior year's fourth quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 20% quarter-over-quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the quarter was $102.4 million or $0.48 per diluted share as compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $58.7 million or $0.28 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of last year.","As discussed in our previous fourth quarter guidance, included in net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2012 is $2.7 million of income or $0.01 per diluted share from the release of income tax contingencies. Included in net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2011 is $8.4 million of income from the release of income tax contingencies and settlements of certain tax audits and a $32.6 million charge to cost of services or $20.4 million net of tax related to a pension plan withdrawal liability. The net impact of these 2 items to the fourth quarter of 2011 resulted in a $0.06 reduction in diluted earnings per share.","The growth in consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter of 2012 was driven by growth across all of Quanta's segments, as well as the incremental contribution of approximately $69.5 million in revenues from companies acquired since the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding the impact from acquired companies, organic growth for the quarter was 15.1%.","Our consolidated gross margin increased to 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2012 from 12.9% in 4Q '11. Contributing to this increase was the impact of the previously mentioned withdrawal charge, which affected the Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment in the fourth quarter of 2011. Consolidated gross margin without the effect of this charge was 15.2% for the fourth quarter of 2011. The remaining increase was due to strong performance in each of our segments, as well as the impact of higher revenues, which improved our ability to cover fixed operating costs.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were $117 million, reflecting an increase of $27.6 million as compared to last year's fourth quarter. This increase is primarily attributable to $14.8 million in higher salary and incentive compensation costs associated with increased levels of activity and profitability and $3.3 million in additional administrative expenses associated with companies acquired during 2012. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 7% in the fourth quarter of 2012 from 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to the impact of incentive compensation costs associated with this quarter's record results.","Our consolidated operating margin before amortization expense increased from 6.5% in 4Q '11 to 10.1% in 4Q '12. Excluding the withdrawal charge, operating margin before amortization expense would have been 8.8% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Amortization of intangible assets increased from $8.3 million in 4Q '11 to $8.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to acquisitions in the first and second quarters of 2012.","Overall, for the quarter, our performance versus previous expectations was driven by record emergency restoration services of $130 million and better productivity on several projects, primarily in electric transmission, which led to greater revenue and profit recognition.","To further discuss our segment results, the Electric Power's segment's revenues were up about $204.8 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 21%. The record emergency restoration service revenues of approximately $130 million this quarter is an increase of approximately $86 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. For the full year 2012, our emergency restoration revenues increased 45% over 2011 to a record $250 million, surpassing the previous high mark of $206 million generated in 2008. Revenues during the quarter were also positively impacted by higher revenue from electric power transmission services, resulting from an increase in the number and size of projects that were ongoing in 4Q '12 compared to 4Q '11.","Lastly, revenues increased due to the incremental contribution of $67.9 million in segment revenues from companies acquired in 2012. Organic growth in this segment without revenues from acquired companies was still 14.1%.","At the end of the fourth quarter, 12-month backlog for the Electric Power segment increased 22% to $2.9 billion, and total backlog for this segment decreased slightly by 1% to $4.9 billion compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2011. 12-month backlog for this segment is at a record level and has grown sequentially every quarter of 2011 and 2012, despite sequential revenue growth in this segment for all but 1 of the last 8 quarters. Operating margin in the Electric Power segment remains relatively flat at 13.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 13.5% in last year's fourth quarter.","Natural Gas and Pipeline segment revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by 18.5% to $445.9 million in 4Q '12, primarily due to an increase in the number of shale gathering system projects currently under construction.","Additionally, we saw increases in revenues from natural gas distribution services as the outsourced gas distribution work for Puget Sound Energy had just started in the third quarter of 2011. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2012, 12-month and total backlog for the segment increased about 4% and 17%, respectively, compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2011. As we've commented before, Keystone is not in any of the backlog figures presented in our pipeline segments.","Operating income for the Natural Gas and Pipeline segment as a percentage of revenues increased to 6.2% in 4Q '12 from a negative 9.5% in 4Q '11. As previously noted, in the fourth quarter of 2011, this segment's operating results were negatively impacted by the withdrawal charge. Excluding this expense, operating margin for our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment would have been a negative 0.1% in 4Q '11. Additionally, 4Q '11 was negatively impacted by increased project costs related to performance issues caused by adverse weather conditions, as well as the Teamsters' union labor strike in the fourth quarter of 2011.","The current-year period was positively impacted by the overall increase in the volume of this segment's revenues due to the shift to more shale gathering system projects and our ability to execute this work consistently at mid- to upper-single digit operating margins. Excluding last year's withdrawal charge, this is the fifth sequential quarter with improvements in operating margin for the Natural Gas and Pipeline segment.","The results of our Electric Power and Natural Gas and Pipeline segments were impacted slightly from the disposition of our telecommunications subsidiaries, as the subsidiaries we sold did perform some electrical and pipeline services. We have combined the residual telecommunications work performed by our remaining subsidiaries with our Fiber Optic Licensing business to create a new combined segment called Fiber Optic Licensing and Other Infrastructure Services. This segment's revenues were $47.8 million in 4Q '12 as compared to $41.9 million in 4Q '11. Additionally, operating margin was 34% in 4Q '12 as compared to 37.3% in 4Q '11.","Due to the lower volumes of telecom revenue in this segment, individual telecom project performance can create more significant swings in operating margins, but in general, we believe that this segment will average operating margins in the mid-30% range. When calculating operating margins by segment, we do not allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization expense for our segments. Therefore, the previous discussion about operating margins by segment excludes the effect of such expenses.","Corporate and unallocated costs increased $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared to 4Q '11, primarily as a result of $7.7 million in higher salary and incentive compensation costs associated with current levels of operating activity and profitability and $0.6 million in higher amortization expense associated with intangible assets.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as calculated in today's press release, was $0.51 for the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.38 for 4Q '11. As it relates to the disposition of our telecommunications subsidiaries this quarter, we had a net loss from discontinued operations this quarter of $0.02 per diluted share. Included in these results was a pretax gain of approximately $18 million or an after-tax loss of $14.3 million resulting from the transaction, which negatively impacted discontinued operations by $0.07 per diluted share for the quarter.","The net proceeds from the transaction of approximately $265 million are currently being utilized for general corporate purposes. However, we continue to evaluate additional strategic acquisitions and investments as we look to opportunistically expand our geographic and strategic service offerings.","Cash flow from continuing operations was approximately $177.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2012. Capital expenditures net of proceeds from equipment sales were about $57.4 million, resulting in approximately $119.8 million in free cash flow for the quarter.","For the full year of 2012, cash flow from operations of about $158.7 million, less net capital expenditures of about $197 million, resulted in approximately $38 million of negative free cash flow. Contributing to the negative cash flow for the year was a substantial revenue growth and the working capital demands associated with funding the large projects ongoing during the year.","Specifically, cash flow has been impacted by increases in receivables and net positions on jobs in progress. Our days sales outstanding or DSOs were 82 days at December 31, 2012, versus 66 days at December 31, 2011, and 91 days at September 30, 2012. The increase in DSOs from the prior year end is due in part to the significant storm work I spoke of earlier, a majority of which remains uncollected as of year end due to the timing of when the work was performed during the fourth quarter.","In addition, the change orders associated with the Sunrise project are impacting this year's fourth quarter and have not yet been settled due to the substantial volume of underlying supporting records that are being reviewed by the customers. Certain balances have been paid since our last earnings conference call. However, a significant amount of the change orders remain in cost in excess of billings and contribute to the overall higher DSO. Detailed discussions and document reviews, although slow, are progressing with the customer, and we currently aren't unaware of any circumstances warranting any adjustments to the amounts invoiced.","EBITA for the quarter of 2012 was $166.8 million or 10% of revenues compared to about $85.3 million or 6.1% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2011. Adjusted EBITDA was $203.8 million or 12.2% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $151.4 million or 10.9% for the fourth quarter of 2011.","For the 12 months in the 2012, adjusted EBITDA was $635.3 million or 10.7% of revenues compared to $375 million or 8.9% of revenues for 2011. The calculation of EBITA, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, all non-GAAP measures, and the definitions of these and DSOs can be found in the Investors & Media section of our website at quantaservices.com.","At December 31, 2012, we had about $183 million in letters of credit outstanding, primarily to secure our insurance program, and we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $395 million in cash, with $141 million of the balance related to foreign operations. Considering our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we had nearly $912 million in total liquidity as of December 31.","Concerning our outlook for 2013, we expect revenues for the first quarter of 2013 to range between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be $0.28 to $0.30 on a GAAP basis. These estimates compare to revenues of $1.33 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.22 in 1Q '12. Our GAAP EPS forecast for 1Q '13 includes an estimate of $5.6 million for noncash compensation expenses and $5.3 million for amortization expense.","Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter are expected to be $0.31 to $0.33 when compared to our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.26 in 1Q '12. This non-GAAP measure is calculated on the same basis as the historical calculations of adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in this release.","We currently expect revenues for the full year of 2013 to range between $5.7 billion to $6.2 billion and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.10 to $1.40 on a GAAP basis. Our GAAP EPS forecast for 2013 includes an estimate of $26.1 million for noncash compensation expense and $20.2 million of amortization expense. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2013 are expected to be between $1.23 to $1.53. We are currently forecasting net income attributable to noncontrolling interests to be approximately $3 million to $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2013 and around $12 million to $13 million for the year.","For additional guidance, we are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate to be between 35.5% and 36.5% for 2013 and expect our diluted share count to be around 214 million shares. We expect CapEx for all of 2013 to be approximately $200 million to $210 million, which includes CapEx for our Fiber Licensing segment of about $35 million to $45 million. And this compares to CapEx for all of 2012 of $209 million.","2012 was an exceptional year for Quanta. We ended the year with record revenues growing 36% organically year-over-year, record operating income, record electric power operating margins, record emergency restoration services and record total backlog, just to name a few. We made significant strategic moves, including selling substantially all of our domestic telecommunication infrastructure services operations, enabling us to further strategically focus on energy infrastructure markets and making additional acquisitions and investments providing further strategic differentiation from our competitors. All of this while ultimately maintaining a strong balance sheet, leaving us well-positioned for continued internal growth and further strategic initiatives. We are proud of our year and the hard work of our employees who helped produce it.","This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Dan Mannes from Avondale.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","And I just had a brief question, particularly on the pipeline segment. When you talk about the shale work for '13, you sort of talk through how you get to the revenue side. Can you talk through how we should think about margins on the shale work, especially given the nice improvement we were seeing sequentially during the course of '12 on shale work?","James F. O'Neil","Dan, we're saying that we should be in the mid- to upper-single-digit range on shale gathering work. That's without any big pipe for the year. Certainly, we're getting more volume. We've gotten more volume throughout the second half of the year. And Bob [ph], I would be disappointed if we weren't in the upper end of that range this year for the shale gathering work.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then secondly on mainline, and I definitely hear your caution there in terms of putting stuff in guidance when it's unawarded, and especially given all the regulatory issues we've seen. But we're sort of hearing from the pipe developers that there's certainly a sense of maybe some concern about availability. We're even hearing some of the large developers talking about entering into alliance agreements and things like that. Can you talk about maybe your positioning for those types of arrangements beyond even KXL, and how you're looking to participate in the mainline market over the next couple of years?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I think since August, we've been talking to you guys about how the communication between our customers has changed on the pipeline side and that we've been in discussions with many customers because of the amount of work that's going to be let out toward the end of this year and '14. And so you could have more of those strategic-type relationships versus RFPs going out, what you would normally see in a normal pipeline season. So I think that, that's the type of opportunities. We're in discussions right now with many customers. We're very pleased with the progress that we're seeing in the mainline pipeline business, and we certainly expect to see some big things, if not by the end of this year, into '14. So that would be my comments on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tahira Afzal from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First question is on guidance at the low end. Again, you've done a great job of explaining the nuances. But if I take the $1.46 and, let's say, take out around $0.15 for telecom, take out maybe another $0.08 to $0.10 for outside storm work, I'd still end up with $1.20, which is above your lower end. So should I assume that the difference is more your caution or what you're building in regards to electric transmission as new projects roll out? And as you've mentioned -- or I guess, how should I be looking at the delta between 2012 and 2013 at the lower end, given shale work that you're assuming is kind of in line with last year?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I think that the big variance between the midpoint and the lower end would be that more of the transmission that we expect or even that we have in backlog would get pushed into the next period because of regulatory delays. And also, the margin position that we've taken. Certainly, we could have some seasonality or not as good execution to get to the middle of that 9% to 12% OpEx. So that would be the scenario on the lower end, that we would have lower margins and perhaps projects get pushed into the next period that we certainly expect will move to construction this year. But if they don't, then that will get us to the lower end of the range, which with the electric transmission is a big variable between the midpoint and the low point.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. That makes a lot of sense. And second question is, I know Keystone remains out there and a moving target. How should we be thinking about how you're treating your capacity and if you're locking some down for Keystone? Is that impacting your ability to bid on some of these long-haul pipelines? And also, if you look at some of the alternates, some other projects that have sprung up in regards to the oil sands in Canada, this seems fairly large. If I add them all up, maybe as large as Keystone. Could you talk about your market positioning in Canada versus the U.S.? And even if Keystone doesn't go through, does that imply that the eventual outcome will be net neutral for you?","James F. O'Neil","Well, you had a couple of questions there. Let me just address that we've got more capacity than any other contractor in the industry. So we've got 9 spreads that could possibly expand up to 12. So Keystone is not going to inhibit us from pursuing other pipeline opportunities. So -- and as far as Canada goes, we're well positioned in Canada, probably even more so in Canada, to take advantage of opportunities to build out projects there as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions -- or a couple of questions. First, on the electric power side. How should we think about margins on the electric power side? I mean, over the past couple of quarters, you've exceeded your sort of your target range given utilization and higher margin stuff that's in backlog. How do we think about that? And you talk about -- your guide seems conservative, and I understand you want to be cognizant of any potential regulatory delays or whatever, but are there any particular projects that you -- we should be watching or that could really move the needle? And then my last question is on the gas pipeline side. As the market starts to heat up, should we expect Quanta to lag in terms of winning projects just as you want to wait for better pricing? Or do you think the market is tight enough where we shouldn't see that?","James F. O'Neil","Okay. To answer the pipeline question first, we -- there won't be a lag. I mean, the industry is already tight, and I think that there's opportunities out there for us, and we're having discussions with our customers just like others are today. And it's a different environment today, and there could be opportunities that move into construction this year. For certain, in '14, we've already had work booked in '14. We can't talk about the detail, but we've got work booked in '14. So it's going to be a robust market, and there's not going to be any lag effect. As far as the electric power margins, I mean, our utilization will continue to be high, and we expect to have stellar execution as well throughout this year. The factors that affect that is that we had such great weather last year that we felt like it was prudent for us to set the bar in the middle of the range and then we'll revisit how our financial performance is throughout the year and adjust accordingly, if necessary. But it's the weather and the excess storm revenues that were predominantly driving the margin improvement in 2012, as well as great execution. So we're just going to -- it's early in the year. We'll just see how things play out. And certainly, we hope to repeat what we did in '12, but we just have to have some things going for us in order for that to happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Will Gabrielski from Lazard Capital Markets.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","The questions I had, I guess, one, on the distribution of small projects side, PSE&G yesterday had an announcement about a 10-year plan to upgrade the grid, trying to fortify it from events like Hurricane Sandy. And then on that type of smaller project work and maybe in the distribution market, I'm wondering what your views are of the utility's ability to do that work internally today versus the need to outsource, and if you could compare it to, say, like 5 years ago when the housing market was healthier, considering the housing market has certainly improved over the last year.","James F. O'Neil","Well, distribution's very regional, Will. And many of our customers outsource a lot of these capital projects and then some do most of their work with their own resources internally. I think across the board, you are seeing increased activity and a tight workforce, not only contractor workforce, but utility workforce to do this type of work, which is an opportunity for us going forward. So -- but we do think that distribution spending will be good going forward, and we've baked some of that in to our midpoint guidance less the excess storm that we've seen in '12.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then as my follow-up, obviously, it seems like you've found a comfort zone in the pipeline business at around a 6% margin, absent any large-diameter work that may be coming. And I'm just wondering, is that kind of the level to think about absent large-diameter work going forward from here?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I think you need to look at seasonality. I mean, our margins have continued to improve in this segment, and yet a lot of our work was in the Marcellus in the fourth quarter, which was impacted by Hurricane Sandy. So we had some weather impacts on that segment and -- specifically gathering work, and we were still able to deliver improved margins quarter-over-quarter. So like I said earlier, my expectations are that we're in the top end of that mid to high range. The seasonality in January is going to be low, though. I mean, we are in a seasonal period right now, so we expect margins should be better throughout the year as weather gets better, which is the typical seasonality we see in all of our business. Third -- second and third quarter, we should have better weather impacts than we do in the first and the fourth in a normal weather pattern year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Rygiel from FBR.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Could you discuss the 14 large transmission projects that will be completed at some point? How many of those are going to get completed in 2013? And how many projects do you have sort of in your backlog that you think you're going to be starting in 2013 at this moment?","James F. O'Neil","I think that we'll probably have 6-or-so projects start rolling off, but we've got 6-or-so projects rolling on, plus others that are out there that we feel we're well-positioned to be awarded. But it's like we've experienced over the last couple of years, that regulatory delays could impact the start of those projects. So we still think the large transmission project market is very strong, as reflected by our backlog, and we think that will continue for the next several years. But we will have some movement on projects rolling off and projects rolling on in '13, much more than we did in '12.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","That's helpful. And Jim, can you quantify the Sunrise change orders? And is there any cautiousness in your guidance from the uncertainty of the Sunrise change orders?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, Alex, this is Derrick. Relative to quantification, we haven't really stated a specific number since we're still in negotiations with the customer. I'd say that the balance is roughly less than 1\/2 of our total cost in excess balance. And then relative to expectations, we haven't factored in anything relative to any adjustments in that receivable.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Very helpful. And one last question, could you just talk big picture about your outlook for backlog in 12 months? Do you think you can expand backlog within electric transmission during that period of time?","James F. O'Neil","Alex, I think it's possible. I mean, we continue to use the word strong for backlog because it's more qualitative, because of the choppiness or the lumpiness in awards. But the markets there would not tick [ph] by any means, and it's going to be a strong year for transmission. So as far as backlog being up at the end of the year, it's quite possible that it could be, but it's going to depend largely on the timing of the project awards in the certain calendar periods in which we measure backlog. And so -- but it should be a good year.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Irwin from Wedbush Securities.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Jim, so in the past and even on this call, you've talked a little bit about potentially splitting some of your spreads, with 6 of the 9 currently in shale. Can you maybe give us a little bit of color on how the decision process would move on splitting those spreads, whether or not you would split spreads specifically to capture more shale work, or if this is something that you would do more to increase the overall capacity if sort of large-diameter pipe projects become available later this year?","James F. O'Neil","Well, it's all of the above, Craig. I mean, we've got a complement of equipment that we could use for whatever the customer opportunity is. So I mean, it could be to pursue more shale work or it could be to pursue more mainline work or a combination of the above. The main thing is we have the leadership, the project superintendents and the leadership, and that next level of leadership that's been trained and developed over the years to be able to lead a spread as well. So we're very flexible in that way, and I think that's an advantage, to be in one of the largest providers of that service in North America. So we're positioned to expand if necessary.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. And now with the disposal of the telecom segment, the dark fiber segment is something that really stands out as really not being so utility-focused, great cash flow business, great growth business for the long term. But can you discuss with us whether or not you have or maybe could consider offers for this business? And can you discuss with us why the operating margins in this segment dipped sequentially to mid-30s? Was this a function really because of the telecom segment disposal impacting project initiations, or if this is something short term and we should see the margins normalized to the roughly 50% level where they've been over the last few years?","James F. O'Neil","That's a good question, Craig. We've actually put all other telecom work, and we still do telecom services but for non-telecom customers, which is typically the electric -- the investor-owned utilities who have telecom infrastructure installed on their electric power infrastructure. And so that other telecom now goes into that Fiber Optic Licensing segment. So basically, that revenue was prior in the telecom segment, but now it's been moved into the Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment. So Fiber Optic Licensing margins are -- continue to be consistent. But the construction margins from the non-telecom customers brings that margin down somewhat, now that it's lumped into this new segment -- or it's an addition to the Fiber Optic Licensing segment. As far as the Fiber Optic Licensing group, we look at that completely different than we did the telecom segment. That's a good business right now. It's a good place for us to put capital to grow the revenues at very nice margins. Is it strategic to us? It's not in the energy infrastructure segment. Did we look at opportunities to either grow it or even divest? Yes. But we don't feel like we've really capitalized on the investment or we've seen the returns on the investment that we've made over the last few years, and that asset in general hasn't reached its value, in our opinion, to date because of the investments we've made in different regions, which -- so we evaluate options on what we're going to do with that segment, and we'll continue to do so going forward. But it's a good business for us, and we're going to continue to grow it over the next several years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noelle Dilts from Stifel.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First question I have, if you could just discuss how current activity levels and project opportunities in Canada compare to the U.S., both for transmission and pipeline?","James F. O'Neil","I think we've characterized in the past that Canada is about 1 year to 18 months behind the U.S. on the electric side. So it's starting to ramp up like we experienced in the U.S. toward the end of '10 and into '11. So it's a very robust marketplace, and it's going to be more active. Pipeline is really moving forward at the same pace that we're seeing in the U.S. right now, and there should be opportunities in '14 and beyond, certainly, that we'll be able to capitalize on.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then if Keystone is approved, could you just talk about some of the steps that will have to happen before you could potentially move into construction and how quickly you think that could happen? Would you have to go back and kind of renegotiate terms? I'm just curious to know what the steps are at this point that would have to happen.","James F. O'Neil","No, we're ready to go when it gets approved. Yes, it's -- but we could move as fast as the customer's ready to move to construction. So it's -- things are pretty much in place for us to be pretty efficient from the time the project is approved to move to construction. We'll move as fast as our customer wants us to move.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify your guidance assumptions. What kind of revenue growth are you assuming from some of the smaller transmission work this year? I believe that segment was very strong last year. Can you continue to see the kind of growth that you saw last year in the segment?","James F. O'Neil","In our guidance, we've assumed that we would have -- and this, again, is the excess storm revenue in 2012. So when we look at $100 million in storm being projected in our guidance for '13, we are looking at mid-single digit growth in transmission at the midrange. And like I said on the call, we could get to double-digits or higher if things go well with the permitting and regulatory project in the -- or our process in the second half of the year. And on the low end, I mentioned that we just see more regulatory delays, and we currently anticipate to where we have somewhat negative growth in electric transmission on the low end of the range.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And on the margins in the pipeline segment, I believe a lot of the work this year will still be in the Marcellus. But if you sort of start seeing some of the other shale activity, do you see margins being at these levels? Or do you see mix shift impacting margins going forward? What are you thinking about some of the other solutions in that activity to improve margins going forward?","James F. O'Neil","Well, we won't take work unless we're in that mid- to upper-single digit range on gathering work. And we are continuing to grow opportunities in both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford that meet those margin expectations. So we think that there's opportunities not only to expand in the Marcellus potentially, but in these other shale regions as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Was there any mainline pipeline revenue in 2012?","James F. O'Neil","There was, in the beginning, in the first quarter of '12. We had some work in Texas as well as in Canada, and then we have a little bit of a small mainline job that we're doing in Canada that some of that revenue was in the fourth quarter and some of it will be in the first quarter of this year.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe you said this and I missed it, but can you comment on uses of cash now that you're after the telecom sale and strong cash flow in Q4, cash was up versus where we were this time last year?","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure. Yes, sure. This is Derrick. I mean, looking at cash and even as you look to the 2013 model, we would expect a stronger cash flow year in 2013 than here in 2012. But a lot of the things that were -- Jim has commented to about the large projects, whether they started in the latter part of '13, and more specifically, even his comments about mainline pipe going into 2014, we continue to believe that cash -- first priority is to deal with working capital associated with those large projects. Clearly, we have CapEx and, at the same time, we continue to be strategic relative to acquisitions and investments. I do think that you'll likely --","[Audio Gap]","that occur potentially here in the latter part of '13 and into '14.","Operator","The next question comes from William Bremmer from Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Can you provide us, Jim, with a little update on the current pricing environment, both on the transmission side and pipeline side there? I guess my second question would really be going to Duke here, give us an update on the inspection and integrity market, what you're seeing there. And then finally, Derrick, I don't want to exclude you, SG&A, very nice, in my opinion, management, given the top line performance. Can you give us a little color for '13? Can we provide maybe a little more leverage to the model there, if that's possible for '13?","James F. O'Neil","Margins -- Bill, this is Jim. Margins in both the electric power segment and the pipeline segment continue to be strong. Margins in backlog are better -- equal or better than what we're experiencing today. So that's a good -- that's a reflection of the strong market that we're in today and the amount infrastructure that needs to be built. As far as integrity, the integrity business right now is a smaller part of the segment, but certainly, there are significant opportunities to grow that business over the next few years. And we're well positioned being one of the -- or the only contractor with its own [indiscernible] capabilities to provide a full service to our customer or provide a total solution to customers. So we're excited about that, and that's a great opportunity going forward. We're also doing work for PG&E as one of their program managers to help rebuild their gas infrastructure network as well. So we're excited about that. Derrick, I'll turn it over to you.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, Bill, this is Derrick. Relative to the G&A, I would anticipate something along the lines, as a percentage of revenues in '13, as what you saw in '12. I don't think that you'll see any market increase. As a percentage of revenues, I think I'd hold it basically around the same.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a follow-up on that last question. My question around that was how much of a benefit you may have seen in the SG&A related to the disposition of the telecom business? I guess if you're suggesting that, as a percentage of overall revenues, there will be some benefit going forward from that, is that the way to think about it?","Derrick A. Jensen","Well, I guess I'd say it this way, that I mean, all of our telecommunications operations have been reflected down in discontinued operations. So the numbers that you're seeing now are for continuing operations G&A. And I would anticipate the continuing operations G&A for '13 to run somewhat comparable to what you're seeing in '12.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just a clarification on an earlier question on the topic of resource availability for the pipeline segment, should the big projects start to pick back up? I mean, it doesn't sound like there's any real concern about equipment capacity. Did I hear you right in saying that there really shouldn't be a resource constraint on the project manager side as well? Such that it would affect any other part of your business, you wouldn't have to take away from kind of wanting to choose where you're going to be, you can really have it all be additive, is that the way to think about it? Or do you have to hire more people?","James F. O'Neil","Well, on the leadership piece, certainly, we've been developing that next level of leadership for the last several years to prepare for this type of opportunity. So having project leadership to run additional spreads, whether it be in gathering system work or in mainline pipeline, we're well positioned to take advantage of that going forward, and it shouldn't be an issue. Of course, the industry is very tight on skilled labor right now and, certainly, that's a challenge. But we feel like we're well-positioned there as well, so that we won't be turning down any work until we're at spread capacity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Wittman from Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just -- I wanted to ask about Howard Partners. We've seen some news out of them that they're making some investments. I guess, first off, can you talk about what's going on with Howard and how much capital that you might need to put into that venture?","James F. O'Neil","Well, Howard is doing exactly what we expected them to do. They're building out infrastructure in the Eagle Ford, which is probably one of the most dynamic shale plays in the world, certainly in the United States. And so we will continue to look at opportunities to invest with them. To date, we've invested...","Derrick A. Jensen","$93 million.","James F. O'Neil","$93 million. And we're certainly happy with that. Not only is it a great investment for us, it's bringing opportunities for -- construction opportunities for us in the Eagle Ford as well. So we'll continue to evaluate whether investments are prudent going forward and that -- with Howard Energy. But certainly, we're very pleased with what we've done to date in the opportunities that was brought to us.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got you. And just -- Derrick, just in terms of the equity and income line, that as a result of that -- as you look kind of the -- as you look into '13 here, can you just give us some color as to how you expect [indiscernible] might grow or change?","Derrick A. Jensen","Actually, I think that overall, it'll probably remain somewhat comparable to 2012. There'll be some offsets to that, as we've got pluses and minuses from various investments that are running through that line. But -- so overall, I think for the year, I probably expect something along the lines of probably around $1 million in total for that line.","Operator","The next question comes from John Rogers from Davidson.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Jim, first of all, you gave some comments relative to the distribution work in the pipeline business, but you had roughly $1.5 billion in revenue there. Is that the right way to think about your smaller pipeline capacity, within that range?","James F. O'Neil","I'm having a hard -- you're breaking up, John. I'm sorry, I can't catch the question.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I'm sorry. Is that better?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, sir.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Sorry, I apologize. In terms of your distribution capacity in natural gas, is it in that $1.5 billion range where your revenue levels were this year? I mean, you mentioned there was some mainline work, but just so I understand the capacity, mainline versus smaller pipe.","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean, distribution is a very small part of that segment. The vast majority of the revenue in that segment is from the gathering work that we're doing. I would say probably 70% to 80% of the revenues in that segment are from gathering. And then the rest of the 20% would be made up of pipeline integrity, gas distribution and so forth. Now with that said, distribution is also a significant opportunity for us because they are undergoing the same regulatory issues as far as integrity and upgrading the distribution systems. And that's a big opportunity that goes hand-in-hand with the same comments I made about pipeline integrity. It's a growth opportunity for us over the next few years.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned some of the returns on the capital in your various businesses. What's the gap right now between the returns in the electric power versus the natural gas business? And how long before they start to -- before the natural gas, I assume, catches up with the kind of returns you're getting in the power business?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, this is Derrick. The primary driver of that would be the commentary that Jim has made relative to when any of the mainline pipeline would come about. I think Jim has alluded to several times that, overall, we look for a 9% to 12% margin expectation for all of our segments. But what it would take for our pipeline segment currently to get to that range is the addition of some of the mainline construction that we're talking about. So once some of the mainline construction came about with even a few projects, we think we'd be able to get into that 9% to 12% range, which should be comparable to what you saw in electric power.","Operator","There appears to be no further questions.

Jim?","James F. O'Neil","Thank you, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with an operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","Quanta's fourth quarter capped another successful year. Compared to the full year of 2013, revenues increased 20%, non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16% and backlog increased nearly 12% to record levels. These results reflect Quanta's leadership position in the industry, strong and safe project execution by our operating units and the ability to execute on our strategic plan to broaden the infrastructure solutions we provide to our customers. As we close out 2014 with this call, I want to thank our employees, who I believe are the best in the industry and the primary reason we consistently differentiate ourselves from our competitors in an ever-changing market environment.","The significant decline in oil prices over the past several months has created considerable concern in the investment community about how low oil prices could impact our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services operations. I think it is important that I spend some time this morning discussing how the current oil price dynamic may impact our operations going forward.","I will do so in more detail shortly but wanted to share early on in my remarks that despite the uncertain oil price environment we are experiencing, we believe Quanta can achieve double-digit earnings per share growth in 2015 versus the prior year.","I want to highlight that our Electric Power segment is the largest portion of our business, which, in 2014, accounted for 67% of revenues and almost 69% of the operating income generated by our 3 segments, excluding unusual items. Our Electric Power segment grew revenues nearly 17% in 2014 over 2013. Acquisitions during the year contributed to the growth. But organically, the Electric segment grew approximately 12%. This growth was driven by solid demand for our transmission, distribution, substation and other Electric Power Infrastructure Services throughout North America. We believe the industry drivers that have fueled this segment's growth over the past several years should continue through 2015 and beyond.","In 2014, Quanta was awarded 2 large electric transmission projects in Canada, the Labrador-Island Transmission Link HVDC transmission project for Nalcor Energy and more recently, the Fort McMurray West 500 kV Transmission Project for the Alberta Electric System Operator. These are the largest project awards in Quanta's history.","The Fort McMurray West 500 kV Transmission Project was a concession awarded onto the Alberta Electric System Operators, or AESO's, newly-created competitive transmission process. Quanta partnered with ATCO Group, a long-time customer to compete for this project. The AESO received interest for this project from companies around the world. And after an extensive process that examined technical, financial and developmental expertise, they selected the Quanta and ATCO team.","Our utility customers have made significant investment in their electric power infrastructure throughout North America over the past several years, and we expect continued strong levels of investment by utilities in transmission and distribution infrastructure going forward.","The dynamics spurring North America transmission and distribution investment that we have discussed on our earnings calls for the past several years continue to drive our customers to invest in their electric power infrastructure.","The most significant drivers include: An aging power grid, the majority of which is approaching or beyond the end of its useful life that is largely not configured to serve the population centers of today; the changing mix of power generation, including the increase in renewable generation development; the switch from coal and natural gas-fired generation; and continued hydro generation development in Canada.","As a result of these dynamics, new transmission and related infrastructure is required to interconnect these new generation sources to the grid and existing infrastructure needs to be upgraded, replaced and modified to accommodate the shift in generation mix.","And finally, new regulation in the implementation of existing regulation are significant drivers of infrastructure investment, such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005; NERC reliability requirements; Mercury and Air Toxics Standards; the recently passed Critical Infrastructure Protection standard; and the implementation of FERC Order 1000.","Turning your attention to our Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment. I would like to share our outlook for both the near and long term and provide commentary about our business as it relates to the current oil price environment. Importantly, our qualitative outlook for our business and my commentary today is largely shaped by collaborative relationships with our customers, which gives us valuable insight into their multi-year infrastructure capital programs. We continue to have a favorable outlook for the mainline pipe market for the next several years. Our customers' capital programs are larger than they have ever been and the number and project value of mainline projects that could move the construction over the next several years is larger than we have ever seen.","The midstream gathering and mainline infrastructure bottlenecks in North America that existed before the decline in oil prices still exist today and will be further challenged with oil and gas production and demand growth going forward.","Of the mainline project opportunities we are following that are in various stages of planning and approval, more than 1\/2 of them are natural gas projects. These projects are driven by production of the abundant supply of natural gas in North America, particularly from the Marcellus Shale. As more coal-fired generation plants are retired and shut down, development of new natural gas-fired generation is expected to increase, which require pipelines.","Several large pipeline projects are in development to supply natural gas to current and future gas-fired generation plants. In addition, demand for natural gas in the Northeast United States for power generation and home heating is growing and there is not enough pipeline in place to meet this demand. As a result, there are several natural gas pipelines in development to meet that need.","Canada has experienced takeaway capacity problems for several years, and pipeline infrastructure remains inadequate to move large volumes of oil sand products to refining centers, particularly in the United States. We have seen a couple of mainline projects slides to the right [ph] that could have begun construction in 2015. However, these delays are due to permitting and environmental factors and not due to the price of oil.","Canadian producers and pipeline operators are taking a long-term view and are committed to moving forward with needed infrastructure development programs.","There are a number of mainline oil projects in North America in various stages of planning, permitting and approval. A substantial majority of these projects are already in secured contractual commitments from producers under minimum volume or take-or-pay contracts. Given that these mainline projects are already commercially secured, they should move forward assuming the required permits and approvals are obtained.","For example, several weeks ago, we announced that Quanta was selected by Enbridge for the Line 78 Pipeline Project, which is expected to address market demand for increased pipeline capacity along the pipeline routes Enbridge has operated in Illinois and Indiana for many years. Our scope of work for Line 78 Project includes the construction and installation of approximately 79 miles of new 36-inch diameter crude oil mainline pipe as well as building and installing a pumping station and terminal modifications for the new pipeline.","The unconventional shales in North America and the Canadian oil sands are also an energy game changer in the energy industry. We believe our customers are strategically planning and investing in the long-term infrastructure they need to harvest and transport these new sources of hydrocarbons over the next several decades, not just years. The complexity, costs and challenges to design and obtain regulatory approvals, permits or right-of-way for large infrastructure projects, such as mainline projects, requires long-term planning and commitment.","Regarding our midstream gathering business, the vast majority of our midstream gathering work is performed in the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, which are primarily driven by natural gas. Demand for our infrastructure services in these shales remains robust. For the minority of midstream gathering work that we perform in oil-influenced shales, we do expect some impact on activity levels this year.","Other services we perform in the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Service segment include pipeline integrity, pipe transportation and logistic management, natural gas distribution, horizontal directional drilling, offshore specialty infrastructure services, facility construction, trenching and other services. Demand for some of these services could be impacted by lower oil prices going forward, but we are not experiencing significant impacts currently.","We do not expect the oil and gas segment to be materially impacted by the lower oil price and remain optimistic about the opportunities we anticipate to profitably grow our oil and gas segment in 2015 and beyond. However, our prolonged period of depressed oil prices could negatively impact our business. We are mindful of this uncertainty, which is reflected in the low end of our annual guidance range, which Derrick will discuss in detail in his prepared remarks.","And finally, our Fiber Optic Licensing operation performed well in 2014. Our lit services rollout continues to progress in our Northeast markets and demand for our dark fiber network remains solid. We continue to invest in our lit services strategy and are engaging current and potential new customers with the broad platform of private network communication solutions that we offer. We believe attractive growth opportunities will materialize over the next several years as our lit service offering gains traction this year and beyond.","In summary, Quanta had another strong year, end-market drivers remain firmly in place and demand for our specialty infrastructure services is solid. We have visibility into significant new project awards this year that could drive higher levels of backlog. As electric power and oil and gas infrastructure projects become larger and more complex, more customers are turning to Quanta to provide comprehensive infrastructure solutions. We believe we have the scope and scale, the technology, expertise, resources and track record of safe execution that differentiates us in the markets we serve.","We continue to execute on strategies that position Quanta for both the near and long-term growth. While lower oil prices create investor concern and uncertainty, I hope you have taken away from my comments this morning that we continue to have confidence that opportunities exist for our Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment to grow profitably in 2015 and beyond.","I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our financial results. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $2.05 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $1.82 billion in prior year's fourth quarter, reflecting an increase of 12.9% in quarter-over-quarter revenues. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the quarter was $67.2 million or $0.30 per diluted share as compared to $166.7 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of last year.","Included in net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2014 was a $49.9 million or $30.3 million net of tax charge to provision for long-term contract receivable as a result of a settlement agreement with San Diego Gas and Electric, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy, regarding an outstanding change order dispute associated with an electric power infrastructure services project completed in 2012. The net impact of this provision on Quanta's results for the fourth quarter of 2014 was a reduction of $0.14 per diluted share.","Also impacting the current fourth quarter results were acquisition costs of $6 million, net of tax, or $0.03 per diluted share. Although we have had acquisition costs from previous periods, the amounts recorded in this period were more sizable as compared to the $2 million, net of tax, or $0.01 per diluted share in 4Q '13. Also in the fourth quarter of 2013 was the after-tax gain of $70.5 million or approximately $0.32 per diluted share from the sale of our equity ownership interest in Howard Energy.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release, was $0.51 for the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.50 for the fourth quarter of 2013.","The increase in consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily due to an 11.4% increase in revenues from our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment and a 15.9% increase in revenues from our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment.","Our consolidated gross margin was 15.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014, which is slightly lower than the 16.7% in the fourth quarter of 2013. This decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower margins recognized on certain electric transmission projects ongoing during the 3 months ended December 31, 2014 as compared to similar projects completed during the 3 months ended December 31, 2013.","Selling, general and administrative expenses, as presented in this quarter's press release, were $158.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, reflecting an increase of $15.5 million as compared to last year's fourth quarter. This increase is primarily due to $17.5 million in incremental G&A costs associated with acquired companies and $1.9 million in higher professional fees, partially offset by lower compensation and incentive costs associated with current levels of profitabilities. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was 7.7% in the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 7.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Our consolidated operating margin before amortization expense was 5.8% in 4Q '14, which is impacted by approximately 240 basis points due to the charge to provision for long-term contract receivable as compared to an 8.8% consolidated operating margin before amortization expense in 4Q '13.","Amortization of intangible assets decreased to $9.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 from $10.1 million in 4Q '13.","To further discuss our segment results, electric power segment revenues were $1.34 billion, reflecting an increase of $137.2 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 11.4%. Revenues during the quarter were positively impacted by increased activity from both electric transmission and distribution projects as well as the contribution of additional power generation projects in addition to approximately $40 million in revenues generated by acquired companies.","Operating margin in the electric power segment decreased to 7.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 12.1% of last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to the effects of the charge to provision for long-term contract receivable, which impacted this segment's operating margin by approximately 370 basis points. Also contributing to the decrease are slightly lower margins earned quarter-over-quarter associated with typical project variability associated with major transmission projects ongoing during the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to fourth quarter of 2013.","As of December 31, 2014, 12-month backlog for the electric power segment decreased sequentially 3.9% from the third quarter of 2014 due to burn on jobs during the fourth quarter of 2014, however, total backlog increased $140.8 million sequentially, primarily due to the inclusion of the backlog associated with the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project. Year-over-year, electric power segment 12-month backlog remained relatively flat, while total backlog increased 11.1%, primarily due to organic growth when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. As we've stated in the previous quarters, backlog will, at times, fluctuate based on the timing of awards.","Oil and gas segment revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by $91.2 million or 15.9% to $663.5 million in 4Q '14, largely as a result of new [ph] contributions of approximately $100 million from acquired companies. The timing of mainline pipeline awards and start date impacted the comparability of legacy operations quarter-over-quarter.","Operating income for the oil and gas segment as a percentage of revenues decreased to 8.1% in 4Q '14 from 8.9% in 4Q '13. This decrease was partly due to certain acquired companies and this segment having slightly higher G&A structures as well as the timing of incentive awards at certain other operating units.","Sequentially, oil and gas segment 12-month backlog increased by 11.8% due to the impact of the Enbridge Line 78 Pipeline Project and the fourth quarter 2014 acquisition of Banister. Total backlog, however, remained relatively flat. Year-over-year, 12-month and total backlog for the oil and gas segment increased by 20.4% and 13.6% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, both as a result of acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, new project awards.","Our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment revenues were up $7.1 million or 17.4% to $47.4 million in 4Q '14 as compared to $40.3 million in 4Q '13, primarily due to higher levels of ancillary telecommunication services revenues.","Operating margin increased to 30.2% in 4Q '14 as compared to 25.1% in 4Q '13, primarily due to the operating margin of 4Q '13 being impacted by a $3.2 million charge associated with gross receipts taxes on Fiber Optic Licensing revenues in certain state jurisdictions.","I typically do not comment on the impact of foreign exchange rates on consolidated or segment results, but the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar makes the topic more relevant than it has been in the past.","Looking at our fourth quarter results on a constant currency basis, which effectively quantifies the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates between the quarters, consolidated revenues were negatively impacted by approximately 2% when compared to the fourth quarter of last year and diluted earnings per share has been negatively impacted by approximately 3%.","Using a similar approach to compare the effects of exchange-rate movements between the year-end 2014 and Q2 '14 for sequential backlog indicates that both 12-month and total backlog balances reported at 12\/31 were negatively impacted by 1% due to changes in currency.","Corporate and unallocated costs increased $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 as compared to 4Q '13, primarily as a result of $3.5 million in higher acquisition and integration costs and $3.6 million in higher consulting fees, business development activities and other expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $6 million net decrease and lower compensation and incentive costs associated with current levels of profitability.","EBITA for the fourth quarter of 2014 was $113.4 million or 5.5% of revenues compared to $268.2 million or 14.8% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted EBITDA was $223.8 million or 10.9% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to $202.8 million or 11.2% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2013.","For the 12 months ended 2014, adjusted EBITDA was $845.2 million or 10.8% of revenues compared to $712.1 million or 10.9% of revenues for 2013. The calculation of EBITA, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are all non-GAAP metrics and the definitions of these and days sales outstanding, or DSO, can be found in the Investors & Media segment of our website at quantaservices.com.","For the full year of 2014, cash flow provided by operating activities of continuing operations was approximately $311 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $287 million, resulting in approximately $24 million of free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $198 million for the full year of 2013, which was influenced favorably by substantially higher storm revenues in the fourth quarter of 2012 that were collected in the first quarter of 2013. The fourth quarter of 2014 had strong cash flow -- free cash flow of approximately $203 million, which contributed to the overall year and there's somewhat typical seasonal effect due to lower sequential revenues and often fewer new jobs ramping up at the end of the year, reducing working capital demand.","DSO was 83 days at December 31, 2014, which was flat compared to 83 days at September 30, 2014 and up compared to 72 days at December 31, 2013. However, the 2014 year-end DSO calculation reflects an additional 7 days due to the impact of reclassifying the $65 million remaining summarized receivable as well as certain other retainments amounts from long term to current assets as of December 31, 2014 as well as the impact of including the acquired net position of Banister in late November of 2014. These items negatively affect the year-end calculation of DSO as there are no material current quarter revenues associated with the balances.","Investing cash flows during the fourth quarter of 2014 were impacted by aggregate cash consideration paid of approximately $101 million relating to the closing of 1 acquisition in Canada during the quarter. Financing cash flows during the fourth quarter of 2014 were impacted by the repurchase of 1.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $48.5 million.","At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $190.5 million in cash with approximately $127.2 million in U.S. funds and $63.3 million relating to our foreign operations. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we had about $336.7 million in letters of credit and guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments and we had $68.8 million of borrowings from Canada outstanding under our credit facility.","Including our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we had nearly $1.1 billion in total liquidity as of December 31, 2014.","However, subsequent to the end of the year, we utilized a large portion of our cash on hand and acquired an additional 6.7 million shares of common stock for approximately $182 million.","Including the previous share repurchases through 2014, this puts our aggregate repurchases at 9.7 million shares or $275.5 million out of our $500 million program announced in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Also subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, we completed 3 additional acquisitions for aggregate combined consideration of approximately $36.3 million in cash subject to post closing net working capital adjustments. Due to the timing of these acquisitions, they have not been included in our current guidance for the first quarter or year-end of 2015 due to the need to complete the associated purchase price accountings. However, although they are expected to be accretive transactions, they will not have a material effect.","Concerning our outlook for 2015, we expect revenues for the first quarter of 2015 to range between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be $0.31 to $0.37 on a GAAP basis. These estimates compare to revenues of $1.76 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.25 in the first quarter of 2014, which included $38.8 million or $25.8 million net of tax of incremental expense as a result of an arbitration decision related to a contract dispute on a directional drilling project that occurred in 2010. The net impact of this decision on Quanta's first quarter of 2014 results was a $0.12 reduction in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.","Our GAAP EPS forecast for the first quarter of 2015 includes an estimate of $11.5 million for non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $9.1 million for amortization expense. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2015 is expected to be $0.37 to $0.43 and compares to our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.44 in the first quarter of 2014","For Quanta, the first half of any year and often the first quarter is the most affected by seasonal weather conditions. For the first quarter of 2015, we currently see substantial precipitation in the form of snow, ice and, in some cases, rain that is impacting the productivity on various projects. These conditions have been factored into our current expectations for the quarter and we see margins in the electric power segment for the quarter slightly below our annual guidance range, which therefore affects the comparability of our results to last year's first quarter. Although the first quarter of 2014 was also impacted by harsh weather throughout much of North America, for many projects, it was only a matter of temperature, not precipitation. And as such, although productivity was impacted, many jobs executed within previously expected margin profiles.","We expect revenues for the full year of 2015 to range between $8.2 billion and $8.6 billion and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be $1.80 to $2.05 on a GAAP basis. Our GAAP EPS forecast for 2015 includes an estimate of $43 million for non-cash stock-based compensation expense and around $36 million of amortization expense.","Excluding these expenses, comparable to our historical calculations, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2015 is expected to be between $2.04 and $2.29, which compares to $1.99 in 2014.","Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release.","As Jim commented in his prepared remarks, our range of expectations for 2015 reflects the opportunity for double-digit growth. However, partly due to continued growth of the company as well as the results we anticipate in the first quarter, we have narrowed our operating margin guidance for the year to 10% to 11% in the electric power segment. Although we believe we may still find opportunities to perform within the 11% and 12% range, we feel it is prudent at this stage to slightly narrow our range of operating margin guidance for this segment.","In addition, as it relates to the oil and gas segment, consistent with the previous quarter's commentary on 2015, we believe the midpoint and higher aspects of our range reflect our ability to be at or above 9% operating margin for the segment and the lower end of our range contemplates comparable results to 2014.","We are currently forecasting net income attributable to non-controlling interests to be approximately $1.7 million in the first quarter and second quarters of 2015. However, these joint venture relationships expired by the middle of the year. And therefore, we expect no non-controlling interest deductions in the latter half of 2015.","For additional guidance, we are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate to be between 34.5% and 34.8% for 2015 and our diluted share count to be about 213 million shares, reflecting the shares repurchased that I discussed previously.","Both our first quarter and annual 2015 guidance reflect the current foreign exchange rate environment. Continued movement of foreign exchange rates in the future could make comparisons to prior periods difficult. We expect CapEx for all of 2015 to be approximately $275 million to $300 million, which includes CapEx for our Fiber Licensing and Other segment of about $50 million to $60 million and this compares to CapEx for all of 2014 of $301 million.","Overall, our capital priorities remain the same, with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and the repurchase of Quanta stock.","2014 was another great year for Quanta. We continue to leverage our balance sheet strength over the course of the year to win work and simultaneously ramp up on a number of large projects, while ultimately maintaining a strong balance sheet and leaving us well positioned for continued internal growth and strategic initiatives. We closed 9 acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of $284.3 million in cash and $134.5 million in securities, which significantly enhanced our electric power and oil and gas infrastructure service capabilities. We continue to make opportunistic repurchases of stock and have significantly utilized availability under our board-authorized program.","And as Jim mentioned, we ended the year with many record-breaking achievements including record annual revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as well as backlog. We continue to execute within all of our segments and we believe that we are operationally and financially well positioned for a continued solid growth in 2015 and beyond.","This concludes our formal presentation, and we will now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So first question is in terms of the fourth quarter, Jim, how did it play out versus your internal expectations? And is the first quarter wide guidance largely tied to weather?","James F. O'Neil","Tahira, was the question about the fourth quarter playing out versus our expectations?","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Oh, yes. Internally, how did it play out? And I guess, because you -- I can only ask 2 -- I wrapped 2 questions in 1. So the second part of the first question is really around first quarter guidance, why it's so wide. It seems it's related to weather, but I just wanted to make sure.","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure. As it relates to the fourth quarter, yes, very, very similar to our expectations. We had anticipated that we had some level of decline from the fourth quarter of last year relative to certain margin profile simply because of the way that some of those jobs contributed to profits last year. There was just difficult variability. So it played out very similar to our expectations. And then as it relates to the first quarter, very much, the range is to contemplate the aspect of the weather dynamics that we see at play. I will say that I would anticipate that, as we get to the latter quarters, that you'll see a wider range than you have historically seen, something that is contemplating both the larger size of the segments as well as some of the variability you'll see in the timing of awards. But predominantly, in the first quarter, it's largely due to the weather impacts.","Operator","And our next question comes from Noelle Dilts with Stifel.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","My first question, I just wanted to dig into your 2015 revenue guidance a little bit more. Particularly, if I look at the low end, if you strip out Banister and some of your other acquisitions, you're looking at kind of flattish organic revenues, maybe up a little bit, excluding FX. But maybe you could talk a little bit about what your expectations are. Does that low end reflect maybe some growth in electric, offset by decline in oil and gas? Or how are you thinking about that? And then how are you specifically thinking about the percentage of your revenues that are oil-exposed and somewhat vulnerable to this low oil price environment?","James F. O'Neil","Yes. I mean, on the low end of guidance in the oil and gas segment, we're pretty much taking into account what backlog we have and hanging on mainline pipe. And then there is some impact to probably 5% of our oil and gas segment. Offshore services is a good example of up to 10% and we baked that into the lower end of our guidance. On electric, it's really about what we have in hand right now on large transmission projects. It doesn't really account any slippages on transmission, but we have baked in some of the downturn potentially in the oil and gas segment on the low end of the guidance, which could be project slippages or some impact from oil pricing and some of our businesses, which we think is a very small majority -- minority.","Operator","And from UBS, our next question comes from Steven Fisher.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just to follow up on that a little bit, Jim. Can you just talk about what your expectation is for the growth rate overall of your regional oil and gas business in 2015 versus what it was in 2014?","James F. O'Neil","Sure. I mean, at the midpoint, we're expecting double-digit growth in both our oil and gas segment and in our electric power segment. So projects are there. I would say that backlog is up in our oil and gas segments for mainline and we -- mainline is playing out like we expected in '15, except we've probably seen a few project slip into '16, which is a little disappointing. But certainly, we still see the uptick. But we've seen a couple of projects in Canada slip. It's more about permitting though and sizing which -- I mean, these projects are getting bigger and it just becomes more difficult for projects to move to construction when we expect them to. But it just looks like we're going to have more work to do in '16 is what it looks like right now. But we expect double-digit growth for both segments at the midpoint of our guidance.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And wondering how you're thinking about electric backlog over the course of 2015. How confident are you to sustain it or grow it from here?","James F. O'Neil","Quarter-over-quarter, you're going to see some variability. But I think the overall trends on backlog in electric is we continue to see opportunities for growth. Our man hours continue to increase. Our customer capital programs continue to get bigger and larger. But I've got to warn everybody again and we caution about quarter-over-quarter. You could have some fluctuations. But over the long haul, right now, it looks like we've got the backlog -- the growth is there for backlog over the long term.","Operator","And we'll go next to Alex Rygiel with FBR Capital Markets.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","A couple of quick questions. First, electric power margins were down for the last 3 quarters in a row on a kind of a year-over-year consecutive basis. And, Jim, you're kind of guiding towards 2015 for electric power margins to be in the 10% to 11% range. What structurally has changed in the last 12 months such that the electric power margins are a little bit lower? And directionally, can they go back up to where they had been in a year or 2?","James F. O'Neil","I'll make some initial comments and I'll let Derrick follow on. But nothing's changed, okay? As far as margins and backlog or the way we contract with our customers, nothing's really changed. We just were in a tighter range here as far as margins as what we've done over the last several years. We have some projects in Canada that are starting up. It's very difficult going right now early on. As projects move through completion, you have more contingencies to release. I mean we're taking conservative positions on some of these projects. We're trying to set foundations in 4-foot, 6-foot of snow. So it's -- that's a big part of it right now. And of course, the first quarter is going to impact the year. And so I think we should be back in hopefully that higher end range as we move into '16. But the first quarter is going to impact the overall year, so we're just going to come out and give that guidance now for the full year.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, Alex, this is Derrick. I think what you'll see is that, as it relates to the quarters, you can see that the margin profile can still be up in our typical 10% to 12% range. But as for the year right now, it's definitely impacted by the weather. There's an aspect of that, that when you look at previous periods, I mean, our first quarter years ago happened to be very, very low and the benefits of Canada are such they contribute such that -- the first and second quarter are -- can be much flatter what they had been. But at the same time, there are aspects of weather that will impact that and that will carry through the year. I do need to make 1 clarification as I recognize that my prepared remarks made reference to an annual guidance of $8.2 billion versus $8.6 billion versus the press release and that's the difference in foreign currency. Our actual guidance in our press release includes the impacts of foreign currency reductions of about $100 million.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andy Wittmann with Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe, Derrick, for you, the stock compensation expense guidance of $43 million compares to $24 million last year. I know that the Banister deal contained, I think, 40% of that consideration was in stock, so maybe that's part of it. But can you explain the sharp increase there?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes. Maybe I misspoke in my prepared remarks. I see my '14 is actually having stock comp of about $39 million and guidance is about $43 million. But the -- yes, we are going to see a degree of increase in stock comp associated with both acquisitions as well as a new program that we put out last year relative to overall for the company with some longer-term 3-year targets in our compensation program and will be accruing against those targets, so that will have a bit of an increase in stock comp program as well.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Maybe I had something tweaked in my model here. The -- just -- Jim, just on the outlook here for mainline, have there been any discussions that have clearly advanced [ph] -- that your feeling like there might be some in the year for the year mainline contributing? It seems like towards the end of last calendar year, you're still kind of having expectations that were fairly modest. I want understand if there's been any change from that? That we might get some more content this year.","James F. O'Neil","Yes. I mean, I want to let you know, we all are going to be executing on some pretty significant mainline work probably more than what we've done since 2010 this year. It's just that we have had a few projects slipped that were back-end loaded into '16. So I'm not concerned about that. It's certainly not the oil price dynamic that's creating that, but we still anticipate double-digit growth in that segment at our midpoint of our guidance. And a lot of that -- the biggest contributor to that is going to be mainline and I think we'll be on more mainline work this year than anything since '10. So it's not like we're not going to be busy. It's just not what we expected 6 months ago. We thought we'd be on a project or 2 more. But anyway, it's still all -- it's still building as a multi-year build and we'll see it's early in the process and we think stacking up at hopefully, at the end of this year '16, '17 is going to play out like we all anticipate.","Operator","And from Avondale Partners, we'll go next to Dan Mannes.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","I want to belabor the point on '15 guide on the revenue side. Jim, you keep reiterating the double-digit growth and I just want to clarify because the midpoint of your guidance range is mid-single digits and, x Banister, it's low. So when you're talking about double-digit growth, are you referring to the bottom line because it sounds like, I mean, the top line, obviously you're not being nearly that aggressive?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, Dan, this is Derrick. I mean, definitely, on the aspect on the bottom line. But on the top line, part of it is an example when you make reference to Banister, some of the dialogue that Jim has referenced relative to oil and gas is also impacting Banister even from the standpoint of what we included in our press release regarding Banister. There is a bit of decline associated really with the push-out of some of the projects, so you'll see a difference in timing. That's partly what's impacting that math far as from an organic growth perspective.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Yes. And FX, too, obviously...","James F. O'Neil","[indiscernible] Canada is clearly where we're seeing the bigger delays. And Banister is -- being the largest mainline pipe contractor in Canada, will be impacted by that. And that's just it is what it is. But certainly, there's going to be significant mainline pipe activity in Canada. It's just getting pushed to the right a little bit.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Sure. And I wanted to follow up just on the current environment as it relates to bidding. I mean, a quarter ago, you were kind of in discussions on multi-year type agreements. I was wondering if you could fast forward that discussion into today and also talk about maybe just the level of bidding you're seeing now maybe even forward, late this year or next year versus maybe what you're even seeing a few months ago.","James F. O'Neil","Well, that's playing out -- the new multi-year agreements with customers is playing out as we expected even more or so. So it's -- again, that's playing out really nicely, the bidding environment, I mean, obviously there are projects that are being bid out, but there are also customers moving some more of a supplier relationship. So all I can say at the end of the day is we see capacity tightening with some of these bigger projects. Capacity is tight now and it's going to get tighter so -- as we move through '15 and into '16.","Operator","And our next question comes from William Bremer with Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Let's just go into the bookings figures here on the oil and gas side. Maybe get a little more granular. Any particular month showed a significant increase in the bookings? Or was it pretty much even throughout and then subsequent to the quarter?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes. I mean, it's hard to say, Bill. The timing of projects are so -- are sporadic. I can't say that I would say -- call out 1 particular month of award versus another relative to that. I mean, we do clearly have the contribution of Banister into that from an acquisition of Banister in the fourth quarter, which I'd say that was in order of magnitude around $125 million of additional backlog. And then -- but after the end of the year, I can't call out if there's any particular way that a month of fluctuation that's relevant.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","And then outside of Canada, can we talk about pricing? How's the pricing in the oil and gas arena right now primarily for midstream and gathering?","James F. O'Neil","We haven't seen any change, Bill, than what it was a year ago. So pricing remains consistent and I would expect that will deliver margins consistent with what Derrick described in his release -- in his prepared remarks. So we're not seeing any change in the pricing environment.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike Shlisky with Global Hunter Securities.","Michael Shlisky - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about the winter storm stuff here in Q1. Are you seeing any opportunities for any winter storm recovery work here, given all the snow that has landed [ph] on the power line infrastructure. And perhaps maybe once the snow melts, could you give any commentary on what customers might be thinking about strengthening their infrastructure in the electric [ph] power side to prevent issues next winter?","James F. O'Neil","Well, we're not really seeing the outages so it's really just white snow. It's not a lot of ice. There's been some ice, but it's been in areas that really haven't created any power outages or storm or force. Storm hardening efforts for our customers continue and that's one of the biggest drivers of our business especially on the distribution side. So there is regulation in place in it, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest where utilities are operating and strengthening their grid, so that will continue. The first quarter is typically a soft quarter for that type of work, but that work typically ramps up in the second and third quarter of the year and well into the fourth quarter. But storm hardening initiatives are underway and they've been underway for several years and we don't anticipate those to back off. We expect them to continue to grow over the next several years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","So I wanted to ask about your -- on the oil and gas side, your primary customers are the MLPs and the CapEx there is holding up much better than what you're seeing on the E&P side. And my question is how long can that continue? And where do oil prices need to go to take a slowdown in MLP CapEx off the table?","James F. O'Neil","That's, I guess, the big question. We're on the low end of our guidance is how prolonged does oil need to be at these lower prices to impact us. We haven't seen it today. I know that E&Ps wanted to drill less wells. They're focused on cash flow and increasing production. And as long as they're focused on cash flows and increasing production, you're going to need pipelines for takeaway capacity and they even make more sense now than they did when oil prices were at 100 because rail's looking really costly right now. So -- and infrastructure programs, we have not seen -- in the areas that we work, we have not seen any infrastructure programs back off. We continue to be very active. Does that change 6 months from now if the price of oil stays where it's at? I don't know. I can't help -- I don't know that. But long -- many of our customers are taking a long-term approach, especially on the mainline side. They've got billions of dollars invested, years of trying to get projects cited and permitted and they're moving forward. So that's where we're at.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And then, Jim, on the gas side, I'm trying to figure out because that was one of the reasons you said we're less exposed because we have exposure in the Marcellus. The gas prices are down a lot, too. I'm trying to figure out what matters more for you? But it's hard because low gas prices are good for natural gas power plants and for the demand side equation. I'm just -- how does it impact the level of activity in the Marcellus?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I mean, I've seen statistics where the Marcellus today provide 16% of the gas supply east of Mississippi and then by the middle of next decade it is going to be over 40%. And the low cost and abundance of natural gas is not only -- it's driving the economy. We're seeing more appliances switch from electric to gas in homes. You've got this coal-to-gas switching legislation, the MATS rules. Power plants will be the #1 consumer of natural gas in this country, which you don't have the pipeline infrastructure in place to do any of that. It's severely lacking. And so that's why you're seeing all these big pipelines propose predominantly in the Northeast and Midwest. And many of them are going to move towards construction. So it's -- regulations driving a lot of this, the economy is driving it, the shales are an energy game changer. You've got this 100 year supply plus of natural gas today that's very cheap and it's the preferred fossil fuel of choice.","Operator","And from DA Davidson, we'll go next to John Rogers.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Jim, I wanted to ask you, in terms of the acquisitions, how are you looking at this market? I mean, presumably, there's some companies that are going to be more interested in selling themselves or not. I mean, do you see this as an opportunity to step up that activity and\/or to diversify your operations internationally or push more into the offshore work? Maybe some thoughts there.","James F. O'Neil","That's a great question, John. I mean, we're always opportunistic on acquisitions. We could acquire the same dollar value companies this year that we did the last several years, but maybe not. I mean, I think, in this marketplace, you need to be very gauged and thoughtful about what steps you'll take going forward, especially if you don't know how this is going to play out over the long term with a low oil price. Right now, we don't see any impact to our business. But anyway, I think it's a good question and I think the short answer is we're going to continue to be opportunistic and find good deals because I do think that we are still in the most prolific time in the history of both the electric power and oil and gas industries and I think some of the strategic moves we make over the next several years will help establish our leadership position for the next few decades and I truly believe that.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And then maybe just for Derrick. CapEx for this year, what are you looking at?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, the -- for 2015, I think we'll see probably about $275 million to $300 million, which is fairly comparable to what we saw in '14 of about $301 million.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Jerimiah Booream-Phelps - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Jerimiah on the line for Vishal. You touched on this briefly a second ago. But in the Northeast, specifically, we're seeing big differentials in gas prices on a localized basis. So could you just speak a little bit to the shifting dynamics between regions? And how that's impacting sort of the pipeline activity? And can we expect more in certain regions?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I mean, it's -- the big driver is the coal-to-gas switching, the mercury emission rules and the necessary infrastructure needed to fuel these power plants. They need to have redundant power plants in place. The second thing is you've got aging infrastructure in the Northeast throughout the U.S. that needs to be upgraded not only to serve the population centers today but the growth that -- and consumption of product that's occurring. And that's one reason you have differentials is you got the lack of takeaway capacity to get the products to the consumers. I can't speak to it regionally. Every region is different. Every municipality is different. They've got different needs. But I could tell you that there's a -- on a global basis, when you look at it at a very high level, there is a sufficient lack of pipeline infrastructure to serve customers and load centers and one of the bigger issues is in the Northeast and in the Midwest.","Operator","And from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, we'll go next to Jamie Cook.","Benjamin Xiao","This is actually Ben Xiao on for Jamie. I guess, most of my questions have been answered. But just 2 quick ones probably for Derrick. First, on FX impact for '15. I think you said $100 million in revenues. How much of that is non-EPS or operating income? And second, your share repurchase, it seems like you're guiding to -- the share count you're guiding to implies no incremental repurchase. Is that the right way to think about it? Or could we see some additional repurchase this year?","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure, yes. Actually, I mean, I'd say that currently as it stands here [ph], has probably impacted us in the 3% to 5% range. And that is factored into our guidance. That is in the release. So it's based upon current FX rates. Again we have not factored in any additional movements between now and the end of the year. So to the extent that things move, then those numbers would have an impact on us. But as it stands, we baked in our guidance the current FX rates as it stands today. From a share repurchase, yes, we have not forecasted any additional repurchases that reflects only activity through today. We will be opportunistic with share repurchases much as we've been throughout '13 or 14. We're focused on capital available for working capital -- CapEx and acquisitions and then we look at the aspect of share repurchase. I do believe that we will be mindful of all those activities as we think about the future and we'll definitely be considering where share repurchases will play. But as it stands today, we have not forecasted any additional repurchases.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions in the queue. I'll turn the call over to management for any closing or additional remarks.","James F. O'Neil","Well, I'd like to the thank you, all, for participating in our fourth quarter and full year 2014 conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services.

Duke?","Earl Austin","Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings conference call. On the call, I\u2019ll provide operational and strategic commentary before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, who\u2019ll provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and 2019 guidance. Following Derrick\u2019s comments, we welcome your questions.","2018 was another strong year for Quanta. We\u2019re pleased with our results and strategic position in the marketplace. We believe our investments in craft-skilled labor and our strategy to strengthen our base business model over the last several years will continue to distinguish Quanta in the utility, energy and communications infrastructure industries.","Upon transitioning into the CEO role in March of 2016, our five-year plan to create shareholder value, including \u2013 included the following key elements: focus on the base business to increase earnings stability; improve margins in each segment; generate $1 billion of repeatable and sustainable adjusted EBITDA; provide solutions to our customers through deep collaboration; and create growth platforms through service line expansion in the utility, industrial and communication industries.","We have grown revenues considerably over the last three years, but more importantly, we have increased profits faster than revenues during that time and improved our return on invested capital. Many of the goals we accomplished in 2018 move us well down the path of achieving our five-year goals.","Our accomplishments in 2018 include; we increased EBITDA by 27%, surpassing $900 million for the first time in Quanta\u2019s history. We ended the year with record backlog of approximately $12.3 billion, which includes record 12-month and total backlog for our Electric Power segment. This is noteworthy and demonstrates the strength of our core operations considering we burned off significant backlog from the Fort McMurray West Electric Transmission Project in 2018, the largest project in Quanta\u2019s history.","We continue to lead the industry in safety, which we believe starts with training. We incrementally invested in our training efforts with the acquisition of Northwest Lineman College, or NLC. Since acquiring the College, we have complement their Lineman curriculum with new communications infrastructure and natural gas distribution services curriculum, which is allowing us to get employees out to the field faster and to be more productive when they get there.","In 2018, NLC and Quanta staff trained more than 5,000 Quanta employees to various programs. We believe our industry-leading training and recruiting initiatives will ensure that we have the very best craft-skilled labor and enhance our ability to collaborate with our customers on future workforce needs. This further differentiates us in the marketplace as a strategic solutions provider.","In response to several major severe weather events in 2018 and wildfires in California, we deployed more than 5,500 line workers to support and assist multiple customers\u2019 power restoration efforts. We continue to focus on positioning our base business for long-term profitable growth, as evidenced by the 21% growth in master service agreement, or MSA revenues in 2018. We accomplished this through new program agreements, increased MSA share and service line expansions with many existing customers.","We ended 2018 with communications backlog of approximately $760 million, a 20% increase from 2017. Our U.S. communications operations added 13 new customers, which more than doubled our U.S. customer count from prior year, and we also increased our penetration with a number of large communication providers. We believe several project and MSA opportunities could materialize in the near-term that could meaningfully increase our communications backlog.","Importantly, our U.S. communications operations significantly improved their profitability in the fourth quarter, and we expect them to grow both top and bottom line results in 2019.","Man-hours worked increased 18% in 2018 to record levels, and we ended the year with 39,200 employees, an increase of approximately 20% over year-end 2017. This is indicative of a strong level \u2013 levels of activity in our end markets and demand for Quanta solutions, which provide world-class execution and cost certainty for our customers\u2019 maintenance and capital programs. And we demonstrated our commitment to stockholder value and our confidence in Quanta\u2019s prospects by acquiring $451 million of common stock in 2018 and declaring an initial quarterly common stock dividend, the first in Quanta\u2019s history.","These are just some of our accomplishments in 2018 that put us on track to achieve our long \u2013 longer-term goals. While we are proud of these achievements, we remain focused on getting better. We continue to believe there is opportunity to create significant stockholder value, as we execute on our strategic initiatives, which include continued margin expansion, adjusted EBITDA growth and improved return on invested capital.","Quanta\u2019s end markets remain highly active, as evidenced by the double-digit revenue growth in both our segments in 2018, and we continue to believe we\u2019re in a multi-year growth cycle. While larger projects capture the headlines and generate excitement, it is the smaller projects, maintenance services and everyday work that is driving much of our growth. We estimate this type of work grew more than 20% and accounted for approximately 80% of our revenues in 2018.","Looking forward, we expect this activity to remain robust and currently accounts for approximately 90% of our revenue guidance in 2019, demonstrating the strength of our base business foundation.","We operate in a variety of large addressable markets. And in the aggregate, these markets account for more than $100 billion in annual spend. We believe opportunities within our end markets could grow CapEx and OpEx spending at a mid single-digit compound annual growth rate over the medium-term, with opportunity for double-digit growth rate in some periods.","The traditional electric utility model has evolved over the past 20 years for many of our longstanding customers from being heavily focused on fossil fuel-based electric power generation to an advanced integrated utility model, with a heavy focus on electric transmission and distribution investment, an increasing focus on gas distribution, as well as increasing ownership of pipeline infrastructure.","Quanta has strategically evolved this business over time to meet these evolving customer needs. This has allowed us to collaborate with our customers and create unique solutions throughout the value chain that benefit the end users.","Our utility customers continue to deploy capital in multi-year electric and gas transmission and distribution programs for grid modernization and reliability. Our utility customers are accommodating a changing fuel generation mix towards natural gas and renewables, replacing aging infrastructure, strengthening systems for resiliency and support long-term \u2013 and to support long-term economic growth. These programs are multi-decade modernization initiatives intended to create robust and reliable delivery systems for the future.","For example, Duke Energy has a $37 billion capital plan for 2019 through 2023. Of that, 64% is allocated to electric transmission and distribution \u2013 gas distribution and integrity and midstream gas infrastructure, all core Quanta solutions. FirstEnergy's capital plan calls for approximately $2.8 billion of electric transmission and distribution investments per year through 2021.","Dominion Energy plans to invest $800 million per year in the electric transmission, has a $3 billion, three-year grid modernization plan and a $2 billion multi-year strategic power infrastructure underground plan. Further, they expect to invest up to $600 million per year over the next several years for pipeline replacement and transmission pipeline modernization. All three of these utilities are meaningful Quanta customers, and we believe are representative of the multi-year investment programs across the utility industry.","Additionally, over the past several years, devastating wildfires in California and hurricanes hitting the Gulf and East Coast have caused significant damage to property and life. These significant weather events have spurred our customers, state lawmakers and regulators to enhance the resiliency of the electric grid.","For example, later this month, the three major California utilities filed their 2019 wildfire safety plans, which detailed approximately $4 billion of incremental strategic investments aimed at reducing fire risk and preventing future wildfires in the state.","Quanta is embedded in the fabric of the North American utility industry and an important resource supporting our customers\u2019 efforts to execute capital programs that are designed to benefit the ratepayer. These dynamics should provide Quanta with a transparent and large regulated end market that is growing and is resilient to economic uncertainty. It is important to note that more than 60% of Quanta\u2019s revenues is directly tied to regulated electric and gas utility customers, which is core to our business.","Within our Electric Power segment, our communications operations ended the year on a strong note, which contributed to revenues growth more than 50% in 2018, as compared to the prior year, led by our U.S. operations. We expect our communications operations to generate approximately $500 million in revenue in 2019, with mid single-digit operating income margins on a full-year basis.","We continue to believe we have the opportunity to operate our communications business with a double-digit margin profile over time, as we continue to scale our operations.","You have \u2013 you may have noticed in our earnings release this morning that we have renamed our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment to Pipeline and Industrial Infrastructure Services. We believe the new name better represents the work we do within the segment and diversity of our service offerings.","Our Pipeline and Industrial operations grew strongly in 2018, driven by base business activity in our natural gas distribution, pipeline integrity and industrial services operations, as well as significantly greater larger pipeline project activity. As we have discussed previously, we continue to optimize the segment and remain focused on improving its margin profile.","Furthering these objectives, we have taken steps to exit certain oil-influenced operations and assets, which we believe is largely complete and will have a favorable impact on margins going forward.","Our gas distribution integrity operations expanded our margins in 2018, as organic investments during the prior year began to payoff. Further, our industrial services group had a record year in 2018, and is well-positioned for another record year in 2019 and beyond.","We anticipate activity levels for our larger pipeline project market to remain elevated for at least the next few years. As pipelines are required to move, the record volumes of hydrocarbons being produced throughout North America to demand locations. Additionally, the potential for LNG export could extend the pipeline cycle, as LNG facilities are the largest consumers of natural gas and many would require new pipelines to feed their facilities.","However, at times, pipelines can face challenges, for instance. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline Project, or ACP, has been halted for the past several months due to permitting issues. The project owners are confident that these permitting issues will be resolved.","However, at this time, we are not certain as to when the project may resume construction. As a result, other than the limited amount of work that we believe will be performed on the project this year, we have elected to exclude it from our 2019 guidance.","We expect larger pipeline projects to account for less than 10% of our 2019 consolidated revenue guidance, and we do not need any additional larger pipeline project awards to achieve our guidance. That said, we are actively bidding and negotiating a meaningful number of other larger pipeline projects throughout North America.","Quanta has strategically focused on diversifying its operations across service lines and geographies in a very deliberate manner. This approach is designed to help mitigate many aspects of risk in our business, including customer, labor, project, permitting, geography, execution, weather and other risks.","I believe Quanta\u2019s diversity, scope and scale and execution capabilities are unique in our space and set us apart, both operationally and as an investment. We believe our portfolio companies, services and geographic diversity position us to profitably grow through various cycles over time.","In our earnings release this morning, we provided our 2019 guidance. We want to highlight a few items when comparing 2018 to 2019, which we believe demonstrate the strength of our base business and long-term strategy.","Quanta\u2019s 2019 guidance includes a little more than $1 billion of larger project revenues versus the more than $2 billion from larger project revenues performed in 2018. This indicates the expectation for our total base business to grow by double digits in 2019. Additionally, we continue to see in excess of $6 billion in aggregate larger electric transmission and pipeline project opportunities.","We self-performed more than 80% of our 2018 revenue and expect to self-perform a greater percentage of our revenue this year. With our strong execution capabilities, we believe our ability to self-perform a high percentage of our work mitigates execution risk and continues to differentiate us from peers.","Also worth noting, it is the first time the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance range has exceeded $3. We believe our 2019 expectations also demonstrate favorable end market trends, the impact of strategic initiatives, the strength of our operations, our ability to safely execute and our strong competitive position in the marketplace.","As we typically do at the beginning of the year, we have taken a prudent approach to the revenue and margin ranges in our guidance to reflect what we believe are possible outcomes based on the risk inherent in our business. As the year progresses and we gain better visibility in our performance, project timing and industry dynamics, we anticipate being able to refine our expectations.","In summary, Quanta performed well operationally against our strategic plan in 2018, which yielded record results. Our end markets and visibility are strengthening, and we continue to believe we are in a multi-year upcycle with the opportunity for continued record backlog and results in 2019.","We expect our base business to continue to grow. We see opportunities for larger electric transmission and pipeline project opportunities to materialize over the coming quarters. There are continued opportunities for multi-year alliance programs over the near and medium-term, and we expect robust growth from our communications infrastructure services operations with improved profitability.","We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class build leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta\u2019s base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers.","We believe Quanta\u2019s diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset is the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our fourth quarter results and 2019 guidance. Derrick?","Derrick Jensen","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record revenues of $3.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, a 25.6% increase over the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to common stock was $56.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to $113.6 million, or $0.72 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was a record $0.96 for the fourth quarter of 2018, as compared to $0.45 for the fourth quarter of 2017. Certain items impacted the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 and were reflected as adjustments in Quanta\u2019s adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock calculation, which I\u2019ll discuss throughout my remarks.","Discussing our segment results. Electric power revenues increased 5.4% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 to a record $1.66 billion. This increase was primarily due to increased customer spending aided by approximately $40 million in revenues from acquired businesses, $24 million of incremental emergency restoration service revenues and approximately $14 million of increased communication infrastructure services revenues.","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment was 9.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018, which is relatively comparable to the fourth quarter of 2017. Our communications operations are included within our Electric Power segment and notably, the U.S. portion of these operations generated its first quarterly profit.","On an annual basis, the Electric Power segment grew almost 15% for the year, with revenues at a record $6.4 billion and operating income grew over $110 million, or 21% to a record $628 million. Without the dilution from our communications operations, electric power revenues generated margins in excess of 10% for the year.","Our Pipeline and Industrial segment revenues increased 61%, when compared to the fourth quarter 2017 to a record $1.45 billion in 4Q 2018, with the most significant contribution coming from higher revenues related to larger pipeline projects due to the timing of projects.","Also contributing to the increase was continued growth in our gas distribution services, which have had steady growth throughout the year. Finally, industrial services experienced another quarter of strong growth, although, in part, due to the negative impact of Hurricane Harvey in the fourth quarter 2017.","Operating margin increased to 3.7% in 4Q 2018, which excluding the impact of the asset impairment charge that negatively impacted the segment by 340 basis points, would have been 7.1%. This compares to 2.1% in 4Q 2017. As Duke mentioned in his comments, we have taken actions to exit certain oil-influenced operations and assets and as a result, we recorded asset impairment charges of $49 million, or $0.24 per diluted share.","This charge offsets the otherwise strong performance across the segment. Compared to 4Q 2017, overall higher segment revenues also favorably impacted margins, as it improved fixed cost absorption in the segment.","Corporate and non-allocated costs decreased $54 million in the fourth quarter 2018, as compared to 4Q 2017, primarily due to $58 million of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recognized during 2017, which were partially offset by $2.3 million in higher intangible amortization during 2018.","With the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, we initially recorded the tax benefit of $70 million, or $0.44 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2017. Subsequent regulations and interpretations have been issued during 2018, which further adjusted the tax treatment of certain items.","In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a net tax charges of $36 million, or $0.24 per share, primarily related to reserves taken on previously recognized foreign tax credits in response to the new regulations. The fourth quarter 2018 free cash flow was approximately $80 million.","For the full-year 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities were $359 million, net capital expenditures were $261 million, resulting in free class flow of $98 million, compared to $152 million of free cash flow in 2017. This decrease was largely due to higher working capital requirements, driven by the increase in 2018 revenues, particularly the increased activity in 4Q 2018, when compared to 4Q 2017.","DSO was 74 days at year-end 2018, down from 78 days as of the end of the third quarter, which positively contributed to the fourth quarter cash flows and was improved from 76 days at year-end 2017.","During the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased $234 million of outstanding common stock in the open market, acquiring 7.7 million shares. With these repurchases, we acquired a total of 13.9 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $451 million during 2018. We had approximately $299 million of availability remaining on our $500 million stock repurchase authorization at December 31, 2018.","Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced an initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share, demonstrating our continued confidence and stability of our base business, long-term growth prospect and commitment to enhancing shareholder value. The first cash dividends totaling $5.8 million were paid in January 2019. At December 31, 2018, we had $1.2 billion in total liquidity.","We ended the year with a debt to EBITDA ratio as calculated under our senior secured credit agreement of approximately 1.6 times, which we believe is prudent in order to support the working capital demands of our growing business and allow us to continue to pursue opportunistic deployments of capital for acquisitions, investments, share repurchases and cash dividend payments.","Before I turn to backlog and our guidance for 2019, I\u2019d like to pause and provide an update on a key customer relationship. As many of you are aware, PG&E, one of our larger customers, filed for bankruptcy protection on January 29, 2019. As of the bankruptcy filing date, we had receivables from PG&E totaling approximately $150 million.","As a key partner to PG&E, we have continued to support them with services that we believe are important to the safety and reliability of their systems. We are monitoring the bankruptcy proceeding and maintaining communications with PG&E management regarding the treatment of our pre-petition receivables, as well as their need for our services going forward.","We currently believe we will ultimately collect our pre-petition receivables. However, as with any bankruptcy, that belief is based on a number of assumptions that are potentially subject to change as the case progresses and therefore, our assessment of collectability could change in the future. We also believe that PG&E will have sufficient debtor-in-possession financing to fund its ongoing operations and therefore, are confident we will be paid for our post-petition services in the ordinary course.","Turning to backlog and our guidance for 2019. As of December 31, 2018, our aggregate total remaining performance obligations were estimated to be approximately $4.7 billion, approximately 66% of which is expected to be recognized in the first 12 months. Our aggregate total backlog as of December 31, 2018 was a record $12.3 billion and 12-month backlog was $7 billion.","These represent increases of 10.4% and 8.2%, respectively, over the prior year and reflect the continued strength of our end markets and opportunities and specifically, the continued growth of our base business, which Duke referenced in his comments.","For the Electric Power segment, 12-month backlog was $4.6 billion and total backlog for the segment was $8.5 billion, both represent records with increases of 13% and 16%, respectively, when compared to 4Q 2017. 12-month backlog for the Pipeline and Industrial segment was $2.4 billion and total backlog was $3.8 billion, slightly decreasing from December 31, 2017.","Turning to guidance. For the full-year 2019, consolidated revenues are expected to range between $10.8 billion and $11.2 billion. Our range of revenue guidance contemplates Electric Power segment revenues of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion, which reflects our confidence in the continued momentum in our electric power and communications operations and particularly our base business.","Of note, this represents segment revenue growth over 2018, which included a full-year of revenue contribution from construction activities on the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project, as well as above the average emergency restoration revenues of approximately $241 million.","Our 2019 guidance contemplates a much lower contribution of larger project revenues and approximately $100 million of emergency restoration revenues, in line with historical averages. As it relates to seasonality within the Electric Power segment, we expect revenue growth in each quarter of 2019, compared to 2018, with quarter-over-quarter growth in the second quarter potentially exceeding 10%.","We expect growth to moderate in the fourth quarter, partially due to the higher levels of emergency response services in 2018. We expect the high-end of our revenue range to represent greater revenue growth opportunities in the third and fourth quarters relative to 2018.","We see 2019 operating margins for the Electric Power segment to be between 9.5% and 10%. We expect that seasonal effect on margins will be comparable to 2018, but first quarter operating margins expected to be the lowest for the year, growing in the second and third quarters and then experiencing a slight decline in the fourth quarter.","Although the high-end of our full-year Electric Power segment expectations contemplate double-digit margins, our communications operations continue to ramp slightly diluting margins in the segment. However, we believe communications operating income margins could exceed 6% for the year and reach upper single digits on a quarterly basis by the end of the year.","Pipeline and Industrial revenues are expected to range between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion. We see double-digit quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in the first quarter, with revenues growing sequentially through the third quarter. Revenues as compared to 2018 are expected to be lower on a quarter-over-quarter basis for the second, third and fourth quarters, with fourth quarter revenues potentially declining over 30% relative to 2018.","After two years, much larger pipeline projects contributed to $1.5 billion in revenues, our range contemplates a significantly lower contribution from larger projects, reflecting the impact of project delays on the previously announced large diameter pipeline project award, which Duke discussed in his prepared comments.","The midpoint of our guidance for larger project work includes approximately $850 million of signed or verbally awarded work, the lowest levels we\u2019ve experienced since 2015. While our ability to deliver on larger projects remains a strategic differentiator, we expect base business growth to partially offset this decline, as demand for our services in the gas utility and industrial markets continues to provide meaningful growth opportunities.","Of particular note, our 2019 guidance requires no additional larger project awards in excess of the $850 million, I previously referenced, and contemplates base business revenues at a level 75% higher than comparable revenues in 2015. Overall, Pipeline and Industrial segment operating margins are expected to improve over 2018 and be between 5.5% and 6.5%.","As we have discussed in years past, our first quarter traditionally has lower activity in our gas distribution business due to weather seasonality, which impacts our revenues and pressures margins. We expect margins will improve into the second and third quarters, but the decline in revenues and normal seasonality will cause margins to decline sequentially in the fourth quarter.","We anticipate net interest expense to be approximately $42 million for 2019. As we have previously discussed, our other expense and income line includes the deferral of a portion of the profit on construction activity for projects in which we have an ownership interest.","In the first-half of 2019, the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project is expected to be completed and placed in commercial operations. And at that time, we will recognize the deferred profit that has been recognized as a component of other expense in both 2018 and 2017.","We currently believe this may happen at the end of the first quarter. Although this reversal will not contribute to operating income or EBITDA in 2019, as it has been included in our operating results in prior years, it will positively impact our earnings per share.","We estimate the recognition of approximately $60 million of previously deferred profit into other income this year or the equivalent of $0.30 in diluted earnings per share. Overall, we expect other income for the year to range between $60 to $65 million.","One more added bit of discussion for further color in evaluating year-over-year adjusted EPS growth. This diluted earnings per share contribution could be viewed operationally as $0.24 of diluted earnings per share related to profit deferred from 2018 and $0.05 of diluted earnings per share related to profit deferred from 2017.","We are currently projecting our effective tax rate for 2019 to be 29.5% \u2013 to be between 29.5% and 30% for the year, with the first quarter rate being as low as 29.2%, due to the tax effect to stock-based compensation, the majority of which impacts the first quarter.","These operating ranges support our expectation for net income attributable to common stock of $407 million to $473 million and adjusted EBITDA between $875 million and $975 million for the full-year 2019.","For purposes of calculated diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended 2019, we are assuming around 147.2 million weighted average shares outstanding. We estimate our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the year to be between $2.76 and $3.21 and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $3.30 and $3.75.","We estimate our capital expenditures for the year to be between $260 million and $275 million. With revenues at the midpoint of our guidance leveling off after years of substantial growth due to the timing of larger projects and the corresponding reduction in investments and working capital, free cash flow for 2019 could be meaningfully improved from prior years.","Over the last three years, due largely to annual revenue growth in excess of 10%, our cash conversion ratio and non-GAAP measure or free cash flow divided by adjusted EBITDA averaged around 20%. In 2019, we could see free cash flow growing to between $300 million and $500 million, or cash conversion ratio of up to 50%. However, similar to prior years, the addition of incremental awards or higher levels of revenue growth than currently forecasted could put pressure on our free cash flow expectations.","As we close out 2018 and look ahead to 2019, I believe both years stand out. 2018 set records every quarter and ended with 18% revenue growth, 27% adjusted EBITDA growth and 43% adjusted EPS growth, a level of performance delivered by our employees that we believe deserves special recognition.","Like the records for the year, the number of highlights are too numerous to mention, but include double-digit growth in both segments and base business activity, continued strong execution on the largest project in company history, margin increases in all major segment areas, and industry-leading expansion and safety and training efforts, all with the capital capacity and allocation backdrop of the expansion of our available credit by almost $800 million, the repurchase of $451 million in common stock, the acquisition of four companies for $146 million in total consideration and the initiation of a dividend, all while maintaining a well-positioned financial profile, a fitting year to celebrate our 20th-year of operations.","Although 2018 was an exceptional year of record performance across our operations, I believe 2019 could be the most significant year in our history. One of our primary focus is, as we embarked on our strategic plan at the beginning of 2016, was to grow the base business and establish a more repeatable and sustainable EBITDA.","As we have commented throughout our prepared remarks, with the push of various projects from 2019 to 2020, the roll out of significant projects and the decline in strong response revenues, we head into 2019 with over $1 billion of revenue headwinds. Despite that, our 2019 adjusted EBITDA expectations show an increase at the midpoint of our guidance and importantly, imply adjusted EBITDA growth of almost $400 million from the start of our strategic plan.","Additionally, we expect almost 90% of our revenues this year to come from what we consider to be a base business, the highest percentage in a decade, which would represent a $3.5 billion base business revenue increase from the start of our strategic plan.","Our goal has been to capitalize on the revenue growth opportunities within the business and have that translate into increased value to shareholders through margin expansion and capital allocation initiatives. At the midpoint of our expectations for 2019, our revenues will have grown at a 10% compound annual growth rate since 2015. More importantly, during the same period, our adjusted EBITDA will have grown at over a 15% CAGR and our adjusted EPS will have grown at well over a 30% CAGR.","As 2019 kicks off our third decade of operations, I believe represents a type of year that Quanta was originally founded for 20 years ago and establishes a new base against we can measure ourselves.","This concludes our formal presentation. And we\u2019ll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Alan Fleming with Citi. Pleased proceed with your question.","Alan Fleming","HI, good morning, guys. Duke, you talked about, obviously, lower levels of large diameter pipeline in 2019, $850 million lowest level since 2015. Maybe you can just talk about your confidence that this is only a low \u2013 temporary low in the current up-cycle and not a kind of cooling off of that cycle? And and maybe your visibility on the large diameter side and opportunities to redeploy some of the available capacity that you had for Atlantic Coast, both in 2019 and 2020, how are you thinking about that?","Earl Austin","Yes, thank you. I think when we look at the segment itself and what we have this year, we\u2019re confident the $850 million, we don\u2019t need any extra awards to achieve our midpoint of our guidance. We\u2019re looking at the company and the portfolio. We\u2019re also looking at the segment with our large diameter pipe becoming less and less of that segment. It\u2019s more steady. It\u2019s less risk and we continue to perform underneath the large diameter pipe. And saying that, the opportunities are still there.","We talked about $6 billion in total for both electric and gas. We continue to see opportunities this year and into the future. By no means that we think we\u2019re at the bottom of the cycle, but it will cycle. It is a cyclical business in large diameter pipe. We continue to make that less of that segment over time and we\u2019re growing underneath quite nicely.","We\u2019re real proud of where the segment sits. The opportunities are still there. We talked about the LNG exports. We talked about moving gas and \u2013 of the Permian down into the load centers. So there\u2019s plenty of opportunity out there and there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to backfill second-half of the year and on into next year. We still like that segment and still like that large diameter pipe business.","Alan Fleming","Okay. And Derrick, maybe you can help us with some of the puts and takes on the margin guidance in electric power and business is growing, but the midpoint of your margin guidance is kind of flattish year-over-year. So is there anyway to kind of quantify the impact you\u2019re seeing from lower levels of large project work and less storm work and then the drag from communications that is continuing to grow? And besides operating leverage, is \u2013 are there any positive offset that are helping you to absorb some of those headwinds?","Derrick Jensen","Yes, broadly, I mean, when you look through the communications dilution into 2019, I think it\u2019s important to recognize that we so look at the Electric Power segment to have the ability to operate at a double-digit margin. That\u2019s our target margin percentage. At the midpoint of the guidance right now, the electric power as a standalone is operating at double-digit margins, which considering the contribution that we\u2019ve had from the large project here in 2018 that contributed being able to get to that performance.","We\u2019re still pleased with where that margin performance is overall coming out. We think long-term, that\u2019s the target margin. Communications providing a little bit of headwind against that in \u2013 from a segment perspective. But to that end, we still think that can ultimately operated at around a 6% margin performance with a growing level of margin contributions through the year exiting, as we\u2019ve said before, kind of in the double-digit margin profile as well.","So, we\u2019re \u2013 we feel like that the strength of the segment is still operating there. It\u2019s important to think that \u2013 back on the large projects side, I mean, a large project component of electric power is ultimately the smallest contribution in a decade. And so to the extent that we\u2019re able to operate at a double-digit profile of electric power. That\u2019s that base business contribution and showing that the portfolio is still ultimately able to execute.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Tahira Afzal","Hi, thank you and congrats on a very strong quarter by the way.","Earl Austin","Thank you.","Tahira Afzal","Duke, first question is, you talked about earlier in your prepared commentary about sort of a mid single-digit growth rate for the industry. Given what seems to be an edge that you have from all the training facilities, should be assume that should provide you an edge to really outperform the industry growth trends over, let\u2019s say, a three to five-year time horizon?","Earl Austin","Yes, thank you. I think I was speaking to us and the industry. Look, I don\u2019t \u2013 can\u2019t comment on that, you have to look at it. But when I see it \u2013 when we see our growth patterns, we say mid to upper single digits. You can go back through the years and look at our performance and look at what we\u2019ve done based upon craft-skilled labor putting people in the field and our ability to do so.","I like our chances to continue to grow that. We set up or to mid single digits over time. And if you\u2019re coming off, let\u2019s just call it, 90% in the base business and we\u2019re growing to mid to upper single digits. You\u2019re growing quite nicely and it\u2019s repetitive, it\u2019s resilient and we like the backdrop which is 60% of it is based upon utility spends.","Tahira Afzal","Got it. Okay, Duke. And second question for me. It\u2019s good to hear about your conversion rate to free cash flow. If I look at some of your peers and other industries that have more of the business base driven by base load activity, which is the way you\u2019re converging. The free cash flow rates are 70%-plus, so I don\u2019t know, but this is a question for Duke or Derrick. But over time, where do you see your conversion rates going?","Derrick Jensen","I would just say in general \u2013 I\u2019ll let Derrick comment. But in general, with the growth that\u2019s underneath of the base upper single digits on, call it, $9 billion, it\u2019s quite a bit of growth underneath. And that\u2019s \u2013 and if you look at us, we self-perform about 85% to 90% of our business.","So in saying that, we derisk our business from a labor standpoint and I hear quite a bit from peers and such that they have labor issues. I don\u2019t think we have that. I think when you look at us, we execute quite nicely in our base business. So \u2013 and I\u2019ll turn the rest to Derrick.","Derrick Jensen","Yes. And on the base business side, I mean, to the extent that we see those levels of growth. I mean, one of things that we\u2019ve always said is the high levels of growth will require a level of working capital commitment. So that base business is still you\u2019re consuming that.","And then the other thing unique to 2019 is that, as we commented, we do have some pre-petition receivables that are out there that we did not forecast to be turning to cash. In 2019, we think that\u2019s conservative position, so that also weighs on the conversion rate unique to the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Noelle Dilts with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Noelle Dilts","Hi, thanks, and again congrats on a nice quarter. first just \u2013 first on the electric side looking at the strong growth you\u2019re expecting in the base business. Could you kind of give us a feel for your thoughts on just the general trends in the underlying end markets versus what you think you may be gaining through share gain? And then if you could comment on how some of the events \u2013 expand upon how some of the events like the wildfires in California and other natural disasters are impacting how utilities are thinking about grid resilience?","Earl Austin","Yes. Thanks, Noelle. I think if you look at the data that\u2019s out there, you\u2019ll see many of our customers are investing in both CapEx for storm hardening, which is related to wildfires storms around the Gulf Coast, East Coast. So those things continue to happen, they\u2019ve happened over time. It seems like it\u2019s more frequently \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it go both ways, where you have natural disasters that are quite prevalent for two or three years and then there\u2019s a low.","So, whether something we can\u2019t predict, but we do see a lot of that today. I do believe that the most of the public is willing to pay for resiliency and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing with the grid. And in general, you\u2019re also seeing different forms of generation going into renewables or natural gas. So the grid is moving around from a transmission standpoint to accept those that load on to the systems.","And also the last thing I would just say is, the modernization is certainly taking place and it\u2019s broad based. It\u2019s not one customer, it\u2019s across the Board and it\u2019s necessary to have a modern system in a modern economy. And I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think our customers and ultimately the ratepayer benefits from the investment that\u2019s been done and continuing. I do believe we\u2019re in early cycles as well.","Noelle Dilts","Okay, thanks. And then you kind of touched on this a bit. But just given some of the regulatory delays in \u2013 on the large project pipeline side, pushing out some of that work. Are you seeing any kind of increased competition for small to medium type of work, as competitors or other players who may have been on some of those lines trying to fill their book?","Earl Austin","I think, in general, we\u2019ve really concentrated on that base and making sure that we\u2019ve grown that and really at the customer level collaborating with them. We really see us just continuing to grow that out. As far as the FERC and all the decisions that are made thereon, let\u2019s call it, MVP, ACP or whatever you would like to talk about.","There\u2019s plenty of opportunities underneath all that, that don\u2019t make the headlines that are $90 million or $100. It\u2019s not the big project that we tend to talk about everyday. There\u2019s lots of those out there. There\u2019s lots of opportunities for us across the Board on those projects.","We\u2019re pleased with where we sit, more pleased with how we\u2019re executing. And I still think it goes unnoticed that last year we had about $2 billion of large projects. In the guidance this year, there\u2019s about a $1 billion. All that is base business growth that you see into 2019 that I still think goes unnoticed.","We continue to talk about a very, very, very small position of what we\u2019re discussing in 2019. So I just want to reiterate, again, the growth of the company at the base level and the margins around it that are sustainable and resilient.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. Duke, I guess, my first question. If I look at your oil and gas margins in 2019 compared to 2018, your guide implies they\u2019re up year-over-year, even if you add back the asset impairment charging in the fourth quarter, with significantly less mainline pipe business. So what I\u2019m trying to understand is the profitability of your base business within oil and gas?","And I guess, as I think over the long-term, is there a path to get your oil and gas base business margins more comparable to what we\u2019re seeing in electric power, because your electric power margins are 10% with little large project work. So I\u2019m just wondering if oil and gas can get to electric power margins in similar base business over time? Because if that\u2019s true, that\u2019s a pretty compelling story?","My second question is, as I think about your 2019 guide again for electric power and oil and gas, you\u2019re not assuming much in large projects. Is there less work you need to win to achieve your guidance in 2019? And then if we do get some larger projects, can you help me understand the operating leverage we should get within each of the segments? Thank you.","Earl Austin","Yes. Thanks, Jamie. First to address the base business and the margins, I think, as a company as a whole, we work in a portfolio and many offices are consolidated. So when we look at that and we look at the company as a whole, we stated our goal, an adjusted EBITDA of 10%, we stand by it. And saying that, obviously, the gas margins are depressed. But you can see the guide from where we ended the year at 5.4%, ended the guide at 6%. That\u2019s on less risk what we consider more sustainable margins going in.","That being said, we\u2019ve talked about mid to upper single digits and the base in the gas side and I still believe those are achievable. The large projects, as we \u2013 we\u2019re talking about, we need \u2013 we\u2019ve also taken a prudent approach in our guidance. We have to work through contingencies on the larger projects as well as the base. We\u2019re in seasonality of weather and such. And so we do take all this into account.","You don\u2019t hear us comment too much about, well, Atlantic Coast pushed or this pushed. We don\u2019t make a lot of press releases on that. It\u2019s because we work through these things and we work through our contingencies. So we do understand the risk of those types and we have taken those into account.","As far as the large projects this year, we have $850 million in our guidance. We feel comfortable with that. And as we go forward, there are certainly opportunities. We\u2019re bidding work everyday. We\u2019re negotiating work. I expect us to fill in on the back-half with work. We\u2019ll talk about it as we get it.","But again, I think, what you see is the very strength of Quanta coming together on the gas side and continuing to increase the baseline margins of the business in the gas side and ultimately, trying to achieve that adjusted EBITDA across the Board of double digits.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Chad Dillard","Hi, good morning, guys.","Earl Austin","Good morning, Chad.","Derrick Jensen","Good morning.","Chad Dillard","Good morning. Can you give us a little more color on the guidance sensitivity relative to Atlantic Coast Pipeline? Does the low-end contemplate a full mobilization?","Earl Austin","I think what we said is minimal revenue and operating income there in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. I think it pushes into 2020, 2021, somewhere in there. Again, we think the project is good. It\u2019s going to go. We will defer to Dominion on timing. But as far as 2019 stands, we have very minimal revenue in it.","Derrick Jensen","And that\u2019s actually, I\u2019ll try to clarify. You\u2019ve referenced it to the low-end, and that assumption that Duke made is applicable to low, medium and high-end of our guidance for oil and gas.","Chad Dillard","Got it. And then I also wanted to get more color on the $850 million of large pipeline for 2019. How much is fully permitted? And also how does that geographic distribution differ versus last year? Just trying to figure out if there\u2019s higher Permian concentration, and what that mean for confidence that these projects may not get delayed, or held up by regulatory issues?","Earl Austin","Yes. We\u2019re extremely confident the $850 million either mobilized or have a high degree of likelihood of mobilizing or already on the jobs. So we\u2019re very, very confident in the $850 million guidance, and it\u2019s basically the same North American footprint.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Wittmann","Great. Thanks. I guess, Duke, just on the oil and gas parts of the business that you\u2019re exiting with bunch of the impairment charges. I guess a little bit of detail as to what those were and why you exited them would be helpful just so that we can understand what\u2019s kind of core today and what is \u2013 and what is not core?","Earl Austin","Yes, sure. I think we stated all the way back to 2016, when I assumed the role as CEO that the energy-related assets and things that we do related to oil were core to us and we would continue to look for ways to exit that in a systematic way that was \u2013 that would benefit our shareholders and I think we\u2019ve done that.","When we look at the assets and they are basically supporting some of the Gulf Coast operations, marine type stuff and we exited that this year. We also wrote a boat off earlier in the year, so that was some of it and this is kind of a culmination of some of that as we move forward. I believe it\u2019s largely complete and we like our portfolio going forward and like where we stand.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just my follow-up here is, just on the terms and conditions around some of the pipeline awards that you\u2019re at least looking at right now on the larger side. Clearly, there has been delays and permitting issues across the Board. We\u2019ve seen, I think, in the public markets different contract styles that are negotiating.","Under the ones that you\u2019re looking at right now, are you still getting \u2013 or can you talk about the level of protections that you\u2019re getting from regulatory or permit-induced stand-down, just so we can kind of evaluate the rest as those continue to fall into backlog?","Earl Austin","Yes. I think our projects, I would say, we\u2019re not incurring cost on any of our delayed projects, it would be cost-neutral at a minimum. So we feel like we have done a nice job of protecting ourselves against permanent risk. It\u2019s a collaborative effort with their owners. We want to make sure that we\u2019re both collaborative with them. We understand the risk and we\u2019re certainly in a \u2013 discussions with them on a daily basis about those risks. So in general, we work together on trying to get things built.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Thalhimer","Hey, good morning, guys. First question I wanted to ask, what would you say is your strategy for nonunion pipeline? There\u2019s so much work in the South, down in Texas. I know you have a small subsidiary that works in that area. Just curious what your thoughts are in growing that business?","Earl Austin","Yes, we do quite a bit of work in the Texas areas. And so we continue to look at that segment, look at the base business in the segment. I think, we\u2019re growing underneath nicely. I think when you look at us in the Permian Basin, you saw us make an investment in the Permian Basin this quarter.","So it gives us some more looks at different workout there. We\u2019ll continue to look at that. There\u2019s some electrification that goes on. We do have quite a bit of nonunion midstream type work down in the areas. We like the business. We\u2019re certainly opportunistic as it comes across.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay. And then second question in telecom. You said there was \u2013 I think it was telecom. You said there were several opportunities that were large and could get booked in. Just curious if those are in your $500 million of revenue that you\u2019re expecting from communications in 2019?","Earl Austin","Yes. I think in general, when we look at that communications segment and the business underneath, it\u2019s not in the segment, it\u2019s on the electric segment. But in general, we see lots of opportunity out there. I want to make sure that we can get to the field and get our operating margins where they need to be. I think with all the businesses that we\u2019re looking at, the macro markets are good. We can certainly drive the top line. We\u2019re highly concentrated on driving the margins and the risk.","So we\u2019re looking at the margins and the risks as well as the top line. But the macro market in telecom business is good. We continue to add customers and customer base. To the extent, there were sizable awards or whichever, a lot of those things are multi-year. And so we wouldn\u2019t look at that being a large contribution necessarily to the 2019 relative to our current guidance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Nick Amicucci with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Nick Amicucci","Hey, guys, good morning. So quick question around kind of just looking at the recent asset sales from pipeline operators. Just curious, because you guys have spoken a lot about the core business and how you\u2019re looking to grow that. How does that affect \u2013 with these asset sales, is there a contract kind of run with the land, so to speak, or would you \u2013 would it be new negotiations that would be undertaken if those \u2013 if that \u2013 those assets were sold?","Earl Austin","Typically, our contracts survive any kind of sale. And normally, they need us and we\u2019ve worked on systems or with customers for a long period of time. We\u2019ve not had any issues over time with assets being sold and our contracts not moving with them, typically that happens.","Nick Amicucci","Okay, great. And then I guess, you kind of touched upon this. When you\u2019re looking at these new types of projects? Are there a lot of \u2013 is there a lot of more Brownfield extension type of work, or is it more greenfield? And if you could kind of give us some more \u2013 I know you touched upon the LNG dynamic. I mean, are you seeing any opportunities in NGLs higher than normal or anything like that?","Earl Austin","Yes. I think we see growth across the board and the gas side. I think those larger projects that we talked about in LNGs, they\u2019re certainly out there. We\u2019re looking at them. But the base of it is right around the utility space and the LDC business, the industrial business, critical path solutions around those things that are allowing us to grow underneath on the LNG exports and things of that nature.","So that\u2019s where the growth is that we\u2019re seeing. Obviously, when you put large, large projects on top of that, it looks real nice and we can do great things with it. But in general, what we\u2019re concentrated on is growing that base business in that segment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Blake Hirschman with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Blake Hirschman","Yes, good morning, guys. Just in light of the improving free cash flow outlook, I wanted to ask about how we should be thinking about your plans and use of cash? You\u2019ve obviously been kind of buying back some stock, initiating dividend, doing some M&A as well. So I just wanted to get an update there?","Earl Austin","Yes, I\u2019ll let Derrick comment some. But just in general, the company has taken a position that we want to be able \u2013 we want to be flexible enough that we can lean into an acquisition, lean into our stock, our dividend or whatever it may be. So we want to make sure that we\u2019re flexible with our balance sheet. And the opportunities here in front of us, we\u2019ll certainly look at those. You\u2019ve seen us big quite aggressive in our stock buyback, which I think is paying dividends for us now. But I\u2019ll let Derrick comment on the rest of them.","Derrick Jensen","I mean, I think, Duke hit it. I mean, our capital allocation priorities remain the same. We\u2019ll be very focused on ensuring we can lean into any of the working capital requirements associated with the business. It\u2019s always the number one priority we have. There are opportunities there. We\u2019ll ensure we\u2019re well positioned to lean into that acquisitions and investments. You see the investment as an example here in the press release today within Agua Blanca. Those type of things are things we\u2019re always mindful of, and we will ensure we have a balance sheet in a good position to be able to lean into.","And then just to lay out lastly, I mean, obviously, from a capital allocation, we\u2019ve leaned into shareholder value with the stock repurchases and dividends quite heavily. And so that will continue to be part of our equation. We don\u2019t forecast that into 2019 or forward, because we look at that as being born opportunistic, but largely against the other allocation areas that we have.","We think the working capital, M&A and investments are long-term value creation, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. Lastly, with the overall parameters of ensuring, we maintain a very strong and conservatively placed balance sheet.","Blake Hirschman","Got it. thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. So I would like to turn the floor back to management for any additional concluding comments.","Earl Austin","Yes, I want to thank the men and women in the field. They\u2019re performing at an extremely high level and I want to thank them. I\u2019d also like to thank you for participating in our fourth quarter and our full-year 2018 conference call. We appreciate your questions and ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you, and we look forward to 2019.

Duke?","Earl Austin","Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide operational and strategic commentary before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our second quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions. This morning, we reported record consolidated second quarter revenues, as well as our highest ever quarterly Electric Power segment revenue. Our record quarter backlog of $12.8 billion bodes well for our expectations this year and opportunity for multiyear growth, and continues to be driven primarily by incremental growth of programmatic spending. It is noteworthy that we achieve the $11 billion in backlog for the first time at the end of 2017. And in only 1.5 years, we have grown our backlog to more than 14% to the record level we reported this morning. ","We believe there is opportunity to add significant new backlog over the coming quarters from several larger electric transmission and pipeline projects. Also, we see multiyear, multibillion-dollar fire hardening programs coming for 2020 and 2021 that are not reflected in our backlog due to the current difficulty of quantifying the specifics of scope and timing.","Before I provide my operational and strategic commentary, I wanted to touch on the charge we took in the second quarter. On our last earnings conference call and in subsequent investor conference webcasts, we discussed that projects dispute with an agency at the Peruvian government regarding certain fiber-optic networks that the Quanta subsidiary in Peru had been constructing for them under our previously awarded concession arrangement. As discussed in our press release this morning, we believe the contracts for the project were wrongfully terminated, that performance and payment bonds totaling $112 million were wrongfully called and that the Peruvian governmental agency is not entitled to the alleged amount of liquidated damages.","As of the date of the contract termination and prior to calling the bonds, Quanta's subsidiary had incurred approximately $157 million of construction cost for the projects and had received approximately $100 million in payments. That means after returning the project to the customer, as required by the contracts and which is expected to occur before year-end, the agency of the Peruvian government will possess the as-completed fiber build and more money from the bond proceeds that it has paid Quanta under the project contracts. We believe that represents an abuse of power and unfair treatment by the agency of the Peruvian government, and that their actions have provided them with unjust enrichment.","Our Peruvian subsidiary has filed for arbitration and intends to vigorously pursue its claims related to these matters, as well as claims relating to payment for completed work and lost income for future operation and maintenance of the assets. ","Quanta's primary end markets in operations are performing well and have strong, multiyear growth opportunities. While we originally entered select Latin American markets based on attractive opportunities for Quanta to support our North American customers, those opportunities must also be favorable to margins with an attractive risk\/reward profile. To that end, we are evaluating our strategy and relevant opportunities for our existing Latin American operations. Furthermore, this incident distracts from another strong quarter in which we had continued robust base business activity in our core markets and other [indiscernible] year-over-year margin improvements in all our primary service offerings.","Turning to our broader operating results. Our Electric Power operations have performed well during the first half of this year from both the revenue and margin perspectives. We expect our electric operations revenues to increase during the second half of this year, while also maintaining double-digit margins, driven primarily by broad base business strength through supporting the growing CapEx and OpEx programs of our utility customers. ","Several devastating hurricanes and other severe weather events over the last 7 years in the United States has spared large, multiyear and multibillion-dollar storm hardening initiatives. However, there is more than a decade of significant additional investment required. For example, the State of Florida recently signed into legislation that requires utilities to create 10-year hardening plans that will call for more undergrounding in steel and concrete structures. As a result, one of our customers has said that he believes that the undergrounding of distribution laterals represents a $25 billion to $35 billion incremental capital investment opportunity over the next 20 to 30 years. In the near term, this utility expects to invest between $11.5 billion and $13.5 billion in transmission and distribution projects through 2022, which includes $3 billion to $4 billion for storm hardening. ","Using storm hardening initiatives as a proxy, we believe the fire hardening initiatives in the Western United States are just the beginning. It remained active for 2 decades or more and could require tens of billions of dollars of investment. ","Earlier this year, the California Public Utility Commission required the 3 major California utilities to file their 2019 wildfire safety plans, which detailed approximately $4 billion of incremental strategic investments in the near term, aimed at reducing fire risk and preventing future wildfires in the state. We are currently working with multiple utilities to that end and believe these large multiyear fire hardening programs are still in the early stages.","We are also seeing larger electric transmission projects being planned due to load growth in certain areas of the United States, driven by data centers, LNG export, industrial facilities and hydrocarbon production areas, such as the Permian Basin. We believe the award of some of these larger projects is imminent. Additionally, we expect to begin construction on the East-West Tie Line Project and have recently secured medium-sized electric transmission project, both in Canada later this year.","Our U.S. communication operations continue to show improvements over 2018. We have slightly adjusted our full year 2019 revenue expectation to around $400 million from $500 million, primarily due to the elimination of revenues associated with the canceled Peruvian fiber project and permitting and engineering delays on some domestic telecom projects. However, as of the charge, we still expect to achieve mid-single-digit operating income margins on a full year basis this year, with upper single digit margins as we exit the year.","Our customers are pushing fiber closer to their customer, fiber backhaul densification continues, additional fiber is being deployed for 5G wireless and broadband network expansion initiatives in rural markets are ongoing. We also continue to believe Quanta is uniquely positioned to provide solutions to both wireless carriers and utility companies as 5G infrastructure is increasingly deployed on the electric distribution system, which will require significant electric lining resources.","Quanta plays a critical role in facilitating the economy, technologies and the lower carbon footprint of the future. Our economy continues to move towards lower emissions for power generation through greater renewables adoption. The shift requires new transmission, tie lines and substations to be built and the existing grid must be upgraded and modified to accommodate greater levels of intermittent power.","Implementation and widespread adoption of new technologies in services, such as 5G, autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles, all require power and new infrastructure, and the power grid of today is not designed to meet those needs. We are in active discussions with key players in these arenas, helping them to understand the infrastructure that is required to support these technologies and how Quanta can help them execute their go-to-market strategies. We continue to believe the role of Quanta will increasingly play in the economy and technologies of the future. It is not well understood by many of our stakeholders.","Our pipeline and industrial segment has increased revenue more than 16% and more than double the operating income in the first half of this year as compared to the first half of last year. As we move into the seasonally stronger second half of the year, we expect continued base business growth and profitability momentum. Demand for those services is growing as utility customers execute on multi-decade system modernization and safety initiatives. We also see opportunity to further expand and scale our gas distribution operations in the Northeastern United States and other select markets that provide attractive growth and accretive margin opportunities.","Additionally, our transmission and midstream pipeline operations are in active construction on several larger pipeline projects that are performing well. We continue to evaluate opportunities to strategically expand our pipeline and industrial operations as we gain scale and diversity. We believe the result will be a segment with higher margins, less cyclicality and a repeatable and sustainable earnings stream.","A frequent topic of conversation with the investment community of late is how we think our business might perform in a recessionary environment. Given the duration of the current economic expansion cycle, I want to stress that we are not seeing softness in our business, nor are any of our customers indicating to us that they are slowing down or concerned about a recession. That said, while we cannot predict the characteristics or magnitude of any future recession in a hypothetical, normal, economic recession of moderate GDP decline and duration, we believe that we could still grow our base business revenues, while largely maintaining our current margin profile. ","Over the years, we have executed on our strategy to mitigate risk inherent in our business, including economic risk through diversification. We have a diverse customer base with low customer concentration, a broad and diverse geographic presence and a diverse and expanding line of services. We believe our diversification strategy favorable industry dynamics and strategic investments we have made to largely mitigate the impact of a recession. ","Overall, we believe the majority of our revenues are derived from customers and in markets that are driven by longer-term, visible dynamics that should be resilient to economic softness. More than 60% of our revenues are driven by regulated utility spending. Utilities have multiyear investment programs that are necessary and have been approved by regulators to move forward. ","It is worth noting that our Electric Power segment revenues have grown at a 7% CAGR since 2013, with base business revenues growing at a faster rate. This revenue growth occurred in an environment with flat electricity demand, significantly reduced larger project activity and the collapse of oil prices in late 2014 and 2015, which adversely affected our Canadian operations. ","Our pipeline and industrial segment increased revenues consistently through the collapse of oil prices in late 2014 and 2015 despite challenges in Canada, which is an energy industry-driven economy. Since that period, we have significantly increased our base business operations. For example, our gas utility-driven distribution operations are meaningfully larger now than at that time.","Our end markets are driven by long-term secular dynamics that we have talked about during our earnings calls and investor events for many years. The infrastructure we build and maintain is required for a safe and reliable delivery of critical services that are necessary to support the economic and social prosperity of the people, businesses and industries in the geographies that we operate. We believe these dynamics in our positioning in the market put us in a position to potentially mitigate the impact of many economic concerns.","Our first half results have been solid, and we are increasing our full year revenue outlook for the second time this year to reflect our expectation of a strengthening second half. Our end markets and visibility are strong, and we continue to believe we're in a multiyear upcycle, with opportunity for continued record backlog in 2019. We are focused on our strategy of generating a more resilient and predictable earnings stream, and will continue to evaluate how aspects of our operations fit with our model and our core business.","Our customers CapEx and OpEx plans continue to grow to historic levels. We are having conversations with customers about programs that are larger in size and longer in duration than we have ever experienced, and there is no sign of a slowing down in the near term. I strongly believe that the industry dynamics and opportunities we see for at least the next 5 to 10 years is exactly what Quanta is built for. ","We continue to expect our base business to grow double digits this year and account for approximately 90% of our 2019 revenues, and believe we can grow base business revenues at a mid-single-digit to double-digit CAGR over the next 3 to 5 years. We continue to see more than $3 billion each of larger electric transmission and pipeline projects, which is a conservative investment estimate, and expect some could be awarded over the coming quarters. ","There are also prospects for new multiyear alliance programs over the near and medium term, and we expect robust growth from our communications infrastructure services operations with improved profitability.","We are focused on operating the business for the long term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our second quarter results. Derrick?","Derrick Jensen","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record second quarter 2019 revenues of $2.84 billion, a 7% increase over the second quarter of 2019. For the second quarter of 2019, net income attributable to common stock was $27.3 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.31. ","As disclosed in today's earnings release, we recognized a charge of $79.2 million during the quarter, which impacted both GAAP, EPS and adjusted EPS by $0.54 per diluted share. The charge includes a reduction of previously recognized earnings on the project, a reserve against a portion of unpaid project costs incurred through the contract termination date and accrual for a portion of alleged liquidated damages and estimated costs to complete the project turnover and close out the project. As of June 30, 2019, Quanta has a net receivable position on the project of approximately $120 million, which we have now classified as a nonrecurring asset. Included in this receivable is $87 million paid to the Peruvian agency during the second quarter through the exercise of advanced payment bonds posted to the project, which Quanta believes were wrongfully called. The bonds were to be exercised only if it had been determined the previous advance payments were not used for their intended purpose. The Peruvian agency exercised the bond in their full amount without affording our Peruvian subsidiary an opportunity to provide evidence of its expenditures on the project. The expenditures incurred were substantially in excess of the advance payments, and we believe the entire advance payment had been used for their intended purpose. Therefore, we strongly believe we are entitled to reimbursement. ","Quanta has never had a bond called by a customer, and it is the aggressiveness of their tactics, including the termination of the contracts and the inherent risks associated international arbitration that influenced certain of our assessments of our GAAP financial positions. We are disappointed with the way events have unfolded around the project and have filed for arbitration. However, we don't anticipate any additional meaningful cost for the remainder of 2019 or beyond. It is also important to note that the reduction in future operations associated with this Peruvian work has a negligible impact on our future expectations. ","Turning to a discussion of our broader results. Our Electric Power revenues increased 10% when compared to the second quarter of 2018 to $1.73 billion, and represent record quarterly revenues for the segment. This increase continues to be driven by the elevated levels of base business activity as our utility customers expand their investment in grid modernization and infrastructure hardening, particularly in the Western U.S. The strength of the base business from the second quarter 2019 offset approximately $138 million in reduced revenues from larger projects when compared to the second quarter of 2018. Also contributing to the increase were approximately $35 million in revenues from acquired businesses. ","Our telecommunication revenues within the segment were negatively impacted by approximately $50 million for previously recognized revenue associated with the Peruvian telecommunications project that was reserved against as part of the $79.2 million charge in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the $50 million revenue reversal, our telecommunications revenues grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, with U.S. operations driving that trend. ","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment was 5.4% in the second quarter of 2019 versus 9.3% in the second quarter of 2018. Included in segment margins is the charge associated with the Peruvian project, which negatively impacted segment margins by 430 basis points. ","Excluding our telecommunications operations, which are included within the Electric Power segment, Electric Power margins were approximately 10%, a slight improvement over Electric Power margins during 2Q '18. The margin improvement was attributable to solid execution across base business activities in the segment, which helped to offset the anticipated softness during the second quarter from our Canadian operations due to normal seasonality and the transition of crews and equipment off the Fort McMurray transmission project. We had nominal, larger project revenues in Canada during the second quarter resulting in lower fixed cost absorption, however, 2Q '18 included the substantial contribution from the Fort McMurray project. Margins in our telecommunications operations bore the impact of the $79.2 million charge, resulting in a loss for the quarter. However, excluding that charge, margins were near mid-single digits, led by performance in our U.S. telecom operations. ","Of note, as it relates to the Fort McMurray transmission project, you may have seen that in June 2019, our partner, Canadian Utilities Limited, an ATCO company, announced that definitive agreements have been reached to sell the Alberta PowerLine limited partnership. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions and should result in gross proceeds to Quanta of roughly USD 47 million at current exchange rates. ","Our pipeline and industrial segment revenues increased 1.7% when compared to the second quarter of 2018 to $1.1 billion. This increase is attributable to slightly increased revenues from larger projects. Operating margin for the pipeline and industrial segment was 6.3% in 2Q '19, an increase over the 4% margin in 2Q '18, which included a 40 basis point impact related to combined charges associated with the impairment of a construction barge and severance and restructuring costs. The margin agreement over 2Q '18 is primarily driven by improved execution across our base business operations as well as higher earnings on larger pipeline projects. ","The strength of these results overcame a $13.6 million additional loss associated with continued rework and startup delays on a processing facility that was approximately 96% complete as of June 30, 2019. A substantial component of this increased loss in the second quarter was incremental liquidated damages amounts due to continued delays in completion, which have now been accrued to the maximum contractual amount. We are in the final stages of this project, and believe we have accrued all known losses. ","Corporate and non-allocated costs increased $17.5 million in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the second quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, with the $4.4 million increase associated with these estimates recognized in 2Q '19 compared to a $6.3 million decrease in 2Q '18. Also contributing were increased legal and professional fees and increased intangible amortization expense. ","Overall, 2Q '19 adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $166 million, which includes the negative impact of the $79.2 million charge related to the Peruvian project. This compares to $199 million in the second quarter of 2018. ","For the second quarter of 2019, we had negative free cash flow of $173 million. Cash flow used in operating activities was $109 million and net capital expenditures were $64 million. The largest individual driver of the negative cash flow was the exercise of the $112 million in bonds against Quanta in connection with the Peruvian project. Also contributing was continued mobilization and tuning costs on certain base business projects as well as ongoing extended collection cycles with certain utility customers. ","As we discussed on last quarter's call, our periodic cash flow has been impacted by billing process changes for certain customers and other slow pay dynamics that have impacted our ability to time the invoice and collect for services performed. This is not isolated to a single customer, and while these extended collection dynamics translate to increased contract asset positions on our balance sheet, we are not aware of any material risk to the ultimate billing and collection of these balances. These negative items were partially offset by the collection of approximately $109 million, a pre-petition receivables related to PG&E's bankruptcy proceeding. ","DSO for the quarter was 91 days compared to 74 days for the same period in 2018. Although impacted to some extent by the items previously described, 3 days of this ratio is attributable to the reclassification of significant retainage balances from long-term to current receivables during the first quarter of 2019 for the Fort McMurray project. We continue to expect collection of this larger balance by year-end. Also, 4 to 5 days of the ratio is due to the impact of retainage in various pipeline projects largely completed in previous periods. ","We did not purchase any of our common stock during the second quarter of 2019, and had approximately $287 million of available authorization remaining on our $500 million stock repurchase program at June 30, 2019. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2019, we announced our third quarter cash dividend of $0.04 per share, totaling $6.2 million.","At June 30, 2019, we had $751 million in total liquidity, which resulted in a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as calculated under our senior secured credit agreement, of approximately 1.99x. As of June 30, 2019, our aggregate total remaining performance obligations were estimated to be approximately $4.7 billion, approximately 77% of which is expected to be recognized in the next 12 months. Our aggregate total backlog as of June 30, 2019 was $12.8 billion, an increase of 11% over the second quarter of 2018 and 3% over year-end 2018. 12-month backlog was $7.5 billion, in line with the second quarter of 2018, and up 7% from December 31, 2018. Our total backlog continues to expand as we capitalize on the growing infrastructure investment activity across our end markets, and specifically, the longer-term demand for our base business activities.","Turning to guidance. Given the continued strength in our base business and improved visibility into the remainder of the year, we are increasing our consolidated revenue range to be between $11.5 billion and $11.9 billion. With regard to the Electric Power segment, we now expect revenues to range between $7.2 billion and $7.4 billion, with the third quarter revenues slightly higher than fourth quarter revenues due to normal seasonality. ","On an annual basis, we see aggregate electric segment operating margins ranging from 8.4% to 8.9%, with the $79.2 million effect of the Peruvian project impacting annual operating margins by roughly 110 basis points. As it relates to operating margins associated with our electric operations, the timing of the commencement of certain larger projects in Canada that impacted second quarter margins is anticipated to continue somewhat to the third quarter. However, we expect Canadian operations will improve profitability in the fourth quarter, particularly as large transmission opportunities move to construction. We expect overall electric operations will maintain double-digit margins for the rest of this year at levels in line with the second quarter. ","Regarding our telecommunications operations, we continue to see the opportunity for operating margins to achieve upper single digits by the fourth quarter of 2019, with our U.S. telecom operations leading the way with a potential to hit 10% by year-end. We now expect pipeline and industrial segment revenues to range between $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion. We see full year margins between 5.5% and 6%. We have lowered the top end of our margin range due to pressure from the approximately $22 million of year-to-date losses recognized on the processing facility, which impacted margins for the year by approximately 50 basis points at the midpoint of our revenue range. Our operating margin range otherwise reflects continued confidence in our ability to execute on base business work. ","We expect third quarter margins to be the strongest of the year for the segment with the seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. While we expect increased revenue estimates to deliver profits within our guided segment margin ranges and incremental earnings per share, the negative impact of the $0.54 per share charge in the second quarter results in our full year earnings per share expectations to now range between $2.46 to $2.79, and our adjusted earnings per share expectations to range between $2.99 and $3.33. Similarly, our expectations for adjusted EBITDA, including the charge, now range between $852 million and $932 million. ","From a cash flow perspective, compared to our original guidance at the beginning of the year, the $700 million increase in our overall revenue expectation and associated working capital to support this growth, as well as the unexpected cash outflow associated with the Peruvian project, together have impacted our cash flow expectations for the year by almost $200 million.","Additionally, wet weather delays impacted cleanup activities on certain pipeline project in the second quarter that have called into question our ability to collect several significant retainage balances by the end of the year, which if not collected by year-end, would become 2020 collection events. As a result of these items and some level of the previously described billing delays, we now expect free cash flow between $100 million and $300 million. ","Given these cash flow dynamics, we are increasing our forecasted interest expense to range between $58 million and $60 million. Looking beyond 2019, we continue to expect stronger free cash flow generation as our base business activities create a more recurring and predictable earnings profile, with the primary cash flow pressure being attributable to working capital to support revenue growth. ","While our second quarter results were negatively impacted by the Peruvian telecommunications project, we believe our broader performance and increased annual revenue guidance continues to reinforce the quality of our craft skilled labor workforce and the ongoing demand for our services. We continue to be confident in the strength of our operations, our prospects for profitable growth and the repeatable and sustainable nature of our core markets. ","This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Duke, can you give us some more color on how to think about fire and storm hardening? The concern that some investors have is that fire hardening work may peak this year in California, but I know you mentioned the example with the long-term spend potential of your storm hardening customer in Florida, which makes sense. When we look at fire hardening, it looks like PG&E's higher spend would be in relatively new term. So what kind of visibility do you have to fire hardening initiatives leading to multiyear growth?","Earl Austin","Yes. I think when you look at the Western U.S., not only California, in the fire-prone areas, you've seen loss of life. And when you see those kind of things typically the regulator and the public utilities will get behind programs that enhance this grid and harden the grid. And I believe that's the case and that's what you're seeing in the early stages of that. People are certainly willing to pay for more modern, more robust systems. And that's -- it's modernization as well as storm hardening coupled together that's creating to build across North America and the world for that matter to support that. And I think when you look back and you look it back on the East Coast and what we've done on the coastlines on hurricanes, some could say wherever we're at, we've been doing this for a bit of time and there's a lot of legroom left on that. This is in a very, very early stages and the systems are older systems, so it's going to take a long time. I think they're multiyear spends that we're certainly in the early stages in the Western part of America.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Duke, somewhat of a related question, but you've continually talked about $3 billion of large projects visibility in both Electric Power and pipeline and infrastructure. But you sounded a little bit more confident about large electric power projects can book, and you used the word imminent. Did something change over the last few months to where maybe there's a bit more urgency for our customers? Or is it just time has passed by so you're getting closer to larger project work?","Earl Austin","I think for our standpoint, we're trying to point out the fact that the larger project pipeline is still there and robust. It hasn't moved. I guess, if I said 10, we'd have to calculate that every quarter, so we just say it's more than $3 billion to give you a sense that it's out there. When we look at these larger projects, we see more of them today than we did last quarter. They're supporting, like we said on the call, your data centers, your LNG exports, they all take substations' big load, all your industrial centers are growing. All that takes big load. Your Permian Basin, we talked about, that's load. So you're seeing those larger projects come into play now more so than you've seen in the past. What we've done over the past 2 or 3 years or even longer, we've done it with no load growth or even negative load growth. So now as you start to see these larger complexes come into play, you start to see load growth and the need for transmission and larger transmission. So yes, I do think, today, we certainly see more larger electric transmission projects than we have in the past, and I believe we'll see some awarded in the next few quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Noelle Dilts of Stifle.","Noelle Dilts","So just looking at some of these kind of challenges you've had on certain projects like you mentioned in the Peruvian and the processing project. Do you view these as just kind of things that occurred during the normal course of business? Or are you making the efforts to sort of strengthen the project oversight and trying to avoid those types of issues?","Earl Austin","Yes. Noelle, the project was a processing facility here in Texas, but that's the first one. In general, what I would say is both of those projects were bid over 4 years ago, started even lower than -- longer than that. So when you think about it and you think about what we said about the business and our strategies around it in our strat plans, we said we would get more repeatable, sustainable and earnings streams that are more predictable. So as we've done that, those two are legacies. Everything we've done after we talk about -- we went -- we had a strategy, we said we'd go 10 and 1. We continued on that path to be more repeatable, sustainable as a company. That's what we've done and that's what's in the backlog going forward. We'll finished these projects up. But you can look at the backlog unless you're going forward, it's all around that strategy. And what we'll see on the future is around that strategy.","Noelle Dilts","Okay. That's helpful. And then second, could you just comment on what you're seeing with Stronghold in the quarter and how you're thinking about turnaround and maintenance work as you look into the back half of this year and into next?","Earl Austin","Yes, Stronghold's done a great job positioning ourselves in the industrial market. We're really proud of that business. It continues to meet expectations or beat expectations and set records for their selves. So we're excited about the industrial business and what it's done for us. It positions us well in the Gulf Coast, and we're very, very happy with the management team there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc Capital.","Tahira Afzal","Just going back to your prepared commentary, confidence around mid-single-digit growth in your base business and hopefully some projects laying on top of that. And if I do the math and really assume that your margins bounce back next year, which I hope they do and expand, I mean, am I thinking wrong when I'm thinking about adjusted earnings power of nicely above $4 by 2021?","Earl Austin","Yes. Tahira, look, I'll let Derrick do the math. But I would say for myself is we are creating a nice base business that continues to see growth across the board supporting our utility customers. But our CapEx and OpEx spends continue to get bigger. Our telecom business is extremely robust. As we look at our gas distribution business, our industrial business, it's robust. So everything that we see on our end markets allows us to think that we'll grow the company, will expand some margin profile within the segments. We talked about a double-digit on the electric side. We believe we can operate there over time. We talked about on the gas to continue to bring it up in the mid-singles, even higher single digits on some of the areas in that as we move forward. So we do believe that's possible. We'll continue to strive to do that. 90% of this year is base business, we believe we'll tack on some larger projects as we move into the next year. So the opportunities are there. We continue to drive the base. I would equate the EPS, I'll let Derrick roll it out.","Derrick Jensen","Yes, I mean, I don't have anything to add. It's all based upon what happens in the core aspects of our business, which Duke laid out. And those, that mass would translate into the numbers that you kind of referenced.","Tahira Afzal","I hear you, Derrick. And just based on what you've laid out for the future, I don't know if the free cash flow revision to your guidance for this year constraints you. But should I be thinking this is an opportunity to buy out stock proactively?","Derrick Jensen","As far as from our perspective, we don't comment as to how we'll be in the market relative to the buybacks of individual stocks. I'll tell you the #1 thing we focused on is kind of what the near-term opportunities are for deployment of capital. And a lot of times, that has to do with what we lean into first in the working capital as well as acquisitions and investments, et cetera, all mindful of the liquidity position of the company. So we have had some movements in kind of working capital demands. And so we'll be very focused on ultimately making sure that delevered profiles stays within our boundaries. Having said all of that, you can see we've been an active buyer of our stock for a number of years and you can see the levels at which we have moved into it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS.","Steven Fisher","Just wanted to start off on Peru. If you could just -- I know Derrick you walked through some of the numbers, but maybe just frame for us what's really the kind of the worst case scenario here to make sure we've kind of ring-fenced what the earnings charge and the cash flow impact could be?","Derrick Jensen","Well, on a go-forward basis, we don't have anything in our expectations relative to this contract. The aspect of everything is, on a go forward is, is effectively recurring operations and nothing associated with the contract as the contract was terminated. We have no backlog and no revenue expectations. On a year-to-date basis, I mean, we have taken a charge that we think puts us in a position towards the most likely scenario of our recovery. We do believe that there is very much the level of upside to the position because as we go into arbitration, we think our positions are strong. We do believe that we'll be putting forward various cases that will lead to a degree of recovery. I will say that, as I commented to my remarks, we do have a receivable position of about $120 million left on that contract. The largest component of that is associated with the bonds that we think, which we believe, were pulled wrongfully.","Earl Austin","And I want to comment as well on that. Peru, when you look at that on the face of it, we will defend that vigorously. We will go after it in the most extreme effort that we can. We're putting everything we have behind that as far as collecting our money, collecting what's rightfully owed to us. We believe that's wrongfully terminated. And just on the face of it, we've basically built a fiber-optic network for the people of Peru and paid them to do it. So it doesn't make sense just on the face of it, it doesn't make sense from a contractual language, and we'll defend it vigorously.","Steven Fisher","One follow-up there is just is there anything worse that they could be asking you for than the $157 million that you have denoted in the press release? And then my real follow-up question is really on the telecom side of the business. What still has to happen for you to you achieve that upper single digit margin in telecom, exiting the year?","Earl Austin","Yes. Peru first. Peru can ask us for anything under the sun. The problem is that they're on the wrong side of it, we're on the right side of it. And the contracts we've accrued, what we believe, or we've expensed, we believe is the right number, and we believe will be on the other side of that as we go into litigation. As far as what we need on telecom to get in double digits, it scale, we're scaling in many areas, we have the opportunities to add more backlog, more customers, and I feel extremely confident as we get into the second half of this year, we'll continue to increase margin incremental level, while also adding customer bases. What's unseen is our place in 5G. The 5G component of telecom is unseen of why Quanta is positioned in the right spot. 5G, you need today every 562 feet per density, and that would have to go into the distribution arena. And so every single pull out there, 562 feet apart, needs an antenna, it needs an electric line. And so in order to do that, in order to get all the technology that you hear about autonomous vehicles, data centers, cloud, Edge, whatever it may be, it's a convergence of heavy fiber and your 5G antennas. We sit right in the middle of that. And I can't say it enough of our opportunity there and how well we believe we're positioned for that opportunity in the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chad Dillard of Deutsche Bank.","Chad Dillard","So I was hoping you could bridge the operating cash flow in the back end of the year. And maybe talk about how you are thinking about when the mobilization will peak out and the working capital burn will subside and the incremental cash that you get from PG&E? Is there any additional outflow from like the Peru situation that you need to contemplate? Or any other project that's in the loss-making position that could burn cash?","Earl Austin","Yes. First, just -- I want to talk a little bit about the cash outflow. When we think about it, we have 41,807 employees, that's up quite a bit as we move forward here. And it's a good thing for us to be adding people to this base business and cash going out as long as it's coming back in at a more rapid pace. So us in the base business, as long as we continue to grow and grow at the rates we're growing at, you're going to have some cash outflow. And you'll get more consistent as it growth rates stays fairly flat. We do have some aberrations in this quarter, but that base business has pulled cash out and it will come back in. I do think when we look at it today, the DSOs on the base business are up, they're up due to our customers catching up with that base business growth. And so it's been more difficult for us to get invoices into the customer, they're paying us on time, but the interface between us, they're behind us. And so we're catching up, they're catching up. As they catch up, I believe you'll see our DSOs on the base business going to a more normalized level. And I'll let Derrick comment on the rest.","Derrick Jensen","Yes. I agree with Duke's commentary. As it relates to the year of that, we are running about 91 days here. I would tell you the Wolf Lake collection alone will -- is probably a 3-day reduction. I think that the timing of the work typically for us is that we have cash outflows in the first portion of the year, cash enclosed in the back half of the year. I still think that's the same thing for 2019. I think we have the ability to have positive free cash flow in the third quarter and a greater amount in the fourth quarter, again kind of mimic our typical seasonality with that. Part of it is we have a lower level of revenues in the fourth quarter, and that's based into the model that typically leads to a turn of cash. As well as I do think as to Duke's commentary, we'll see a degree of reduced DSOs. I think that you could see DSOs by the end of the year getting down into the kind of the low 80s that's consistent what I think what our commentary was in the first quarter, getting down into that kind of level. And then to Duke's point, as we go through, that will, I think, lead to generally normalized type of collections and billing cycles associated with the customers.","Chad Dillard","That's helpful. And then just switching over to Lat Am. In the release, you mentioned that you're evaluating whether to just stay in the business. And I was hoping you could give a little bit color on that. Is there potential sale? Is it of a wind-down, hardly about the time table or the framework to approach that decision? And then lastly, how big is that business right now?","Earl Austin","Yes. So to answer your question, in Lat Am, certainly all those strategies are on the table. What I would say is the company has said and continues to believe our strategy is to be more repeatable, sustainable, less risk. If Lat Am is creating risk, both from a macro standpoint, geopolitical standpoint, we are focused on derisking the business as a strategy. So when we look at that, we went to Latin America to support our North American customers on their builds in those countries. We felt like that we mitigated those risk even in this project. It was a 10-year, $250 million project that had a lot of maintenance over time. We felt really good about where we're at. When you have geopolitical type risks in countries that change from a growing middle class to something different, we'll certainly look to derisk those business and derisk those parts of the world. So we've stated our strategy and we're certainly sticking to that.","Derrick Jensen","On a run rate basis, I would say that Lat Am is probably in the $100 million range at this stage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.","Brent Thielman","Duke, on the fire hardening initiatives, and in particular, I guess, the work with PG&E, are they being more selective in terms of who they're working with, just given their current position in Chapter 11? I'm just wondering if that's actually allowing you to capture some more share with them?","Earl Austin","Yes. I mean, we've been a line contractor for PG&E in a long time. It's probably our top electric customer for a while. And we've supported each other many, many times. We know the area, we know the people there. So it's a great customer. But it's one customer. The whole western hemisphere has fire hardening projects. We really get more programmatic where we're doing much more than just construction out there. We're doing a lot more globally, for that matter, when we look at engineering, when we look at distribution engineerings and things of that nature. The company is really looking at more programmatic stuff. And as -- they can't -- you can't, as a utility, ramp that fast, so we're able to basically help them, collaborate with them to create the right environment, create the right cost structure for the rate payers as well. And so it really makes a lot of sense for us to collaborate on a lot of these big builds in the West, as well as everywhere for that matter. Labor resources, they're tight. We've invested over $100 million in training. It bodes well for us as we move into these kind of environments. And we've said it on the call, we'll say it again, we've never seen the type of environment that we've had today and the type of macro markets that are out there that Quanta can take advantage of and sit right in the middle of. It's right down the middle for us and what Quanta was built for.","Brent Thielman","Okay. I appreciate that. And my follow-up is on the pipeline side. I mean, it sounds like plenty of work to do work there. I guess, are you seeing any customers trying to accelerate project schedules and kind of getting into an election year and maybe there's some questions about what the regulatory environment looks like 2 years from now?","Earl Austin","Yes. I mean, I would tell you that like every one of them would accelerate as fast as they can go. It's just they're going to be prudent about how they permit and making sure that all the permits, their i's are crossed and t's are dotted. It's not fun to get on these projects and stop and start for them or us, and so I prefer they get all their permits, and I know they think the same thing. That being said, I do believe that the processing will get easier with the current FERC administration, as well as in D.C., over time as the courts get more normalized and things of that nature. But as far as the Permian Basin seeing a lot coming out of Texas, lots of support in LNG, Canada's got some projects that are fixing to go, so we do see a lot of activity still in large pipe for the next few years, at least. And it's -- we're still looking at work, booking work today for this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Rygiel of B. Riley FBR.","Alexander Rygiel","Derrick, could you clarify what was the revenue expectation you thought the telecom business could deliver in 2019? And how does that compare to 2018?","Derrick Jensen","Yes, at this stage, I would say that we're probably in the $400 million to $450 million run rate type range. The number gets a little bit kind of hard to deal with when you're dealing with the revenue adjustment on the Peruvian project. But on a run rate basis, it's probably in the $400 million to $450 million type range. Last year, I think we were at the -- I think we ended the year around $350 million, but I have to double check that.","Alexander Rygiel","I'm sorry, and that's total company or is that just U.S.?","Derrick Jensen","That's total company. Last year, we ended up about $270 million.","Alexander Rygiel","Okay.","Derrick Jensen","I would say in general, we paced that growth and the opportunity for us to grow more is certainly there. We wanted to make sure the permitting and such was in place before we started deploying mass crews to the systems. We're really worried about the margin profile there and making sure that we deliver on that. And that's certainly by design. The business itself and the business is out there, we could pull the business up much more, but it would dilute margins on the growth. And I don't think it's the right thing to do. I think we'll pace it, scale it more efficiently. So it's by design. We can certainly move that needle up quite a bit there. On the revenue side.","Alexander Rygiel","And then more of a bigger picture question. With a company that can deliver $900 million to $1 billion in EBITDA, would you think more normalized free cash flow numbers should be at some point over time on an annual basis?","Derrick Jensen","The beginning of the year, we commented that we thought we could see free cash flow conversion related to EBITDA in the 40% type range. I continue to think that we have the ability to see that. The biggest change that you saw relative to that expectation this year was the growth in the revenue side, which we said would always create potential drives against that number as well as what we've dealt with here relative to the Peruvian side. But on a go-forward basis, we see the ability just to get increase that conversion ratio and I think you can see numbers approximating that 40% original guidance.","Earl Austin","And I would say also that just our deployment of the baseload crews is unprecedented. It just is. We're deploying a bunch of baseload crews at this point.","Derrick Jensen","And to Duke's point, those are the things that influence that number for us. Growth is inherently the biggest wild card relative to how we think about cash flow.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","Most of my questions have been answered, but I guess Derrick or Duke, when we think about the pipeline and industrial business, the margins have grown this year with some onetime headwinds to margins and without big pipeline work. So I guess as I think about over sort of the next couple of years, understanding there are some scale that need to be had in geographic diversification, how do I think about normal sort of margin progression in that business assuming the base business seems to grow in line with your expectations? I mean because this year, if we adjust everything out it's probably up almost I think it's up to 6.3% relative to 4.3% last year. So I'm just trying to think is that a normal margin agreement that we should see as the base business tries to grow without pipe?","Earl Austin","Jamie, I think we've said that we'll continue to increase those margins into your upper single digits. And that's certainly the aspiration of the company, the goal of the company where we're at today, but it'll incrementally get better in the year 7, 8, even year 9 as we move forward in my mind. It's that type of business. It's repeatable, sustainable. We can get up in those ranges and certainly you've seen us take -- if you look at just our distribution business, which we're not going to break out, but it's there, and it's done much, much better as we scale these offices. As we move into the Northeast and do some other things, I think in general, you'll see the whole segment move up. Our major projects, we're derisking those as well. So I believe our industrial business and our distribution business gets stronger and stronger, our pipe business is there. It does an awful lot of free cash. When that gets going, it certainly stacks on top, but it's not necessary to get in those type of margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis.","Adam Thalhimer","I wanted to ask first about the margins in Electric Power. We came in to Q2 thinking that was going to low point for the year. You outperformed that, and I'm just curious why you outperformed in Q2?","Earl Austin","Yes. I think when you look at 2Q, you see a lot of strength to the company in scaling even with adding crews. So you had a lot of utilizations across the board. We were busy, working more man-hours than we anticipated. It gets some utilizations on your equipment so your margins improve. I will say we did have a drag in Canada just like we thought we would, and it will continue in the third quarter to be somewhat of a drag. But I can only say that it's because the -- it's by design we believe the fourth quarter will pick up substantially, and there are some things on the table that we believe will allow us to continue to grow the business in 2020 and beyond. So we're pretty excited about Canada, what's going on up there as well as our base business. And we continue to get fully utilized or even more so. So as we deploy crews, we get scale, it creates margin. We talked about it many times that we should look at that business in kind of a 10% business over time. And I will stand by it. It will -- sometimes you'll see 11%, sometimes you'll see 9%. But over time, we can create that 10% margin profile. It will fluctuate a little bit quarter-to-quarter. If you have storms, if you have more work, if you're working more time, because your equipment gets fully utilized. So it's more of a product of utilization on our fleet.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay. And then you raised back half guidance versus what you thought 3 months ago. What are the biggest drivers behind that?","Earl Austin","I think from my standpoint, when we look at our business, look at our man-hour runs, look at our headcounts in the second quarter, we see a more robust second half on our base business. It allows us to move that up, and we've talked about prudent guidance and how we think about it. And we're guiding to the back half to the year. And as we go through it, we'll operate through it. We'll certainly continue to evaluate where we sit on any given quarter, on any given second half but -- in general, I think we continue to get stronger and have the opportunity to even strengthen more in the back half.","Operator","Our final question comes from Justin Hauke of Robert W. Baird.","Justin Hauke","Yes. So just couple of more very quick cash flow questions. But can you remind us, what's the remaining AR that's tied to PG&E that's still is out there? And then does your guidance for $100 million to $300 million, does that include the $47 million you're planning to pick up on the Fort McMurray sale? And what quarter does that fall in?","Derrick Jensen","Yes. The noncurrent asset component of PG&E is still roughly about $41 million. That is not in our expectations for this year. We still look at that as something that has the risk of going back or going into 2020 type of event. And then the Fort McMurray sale is not in our expectations at this stage. We believe that, that has as much of a degree of risk of being into the first quarter part of 2020. So at this stage, it's not my current expectation.","Justin Hauke","Okay. And then, I guess, one last one on Peru. I think their total damages that they're claiming, if you add it up, is $157 million. And the cash that you guys have paid out, including the bonds that exercised, I think was $114 million. So I guess the question is, is that delta the amount, I mean if everything went against you that ultimately there is $40-plus million of potential cash that could out? And I guess the second part of that would be, are there any additional performance or surety bonds that they have the power to exercise?","Derrick Jensen","There are no additional bonds outstanding. And I'd probably come back to answer the question more along the lines of I have $120 million of receivables still on the books.

Duke?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. On the call, I will provide operational and strategic commentary before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who'll provide a detailed review of our first quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","This year is off to a good start, and we are pleased with our results. First quarter revenues were a record $2.4 billion in GAAP, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.24 and $0.40, respectively. We ended the quarter with record 12-month and total backlog for each of our segments and had record consolidated backlog of approximately $11.7 billion, which we believe supports our expectations for this year and bodes well for opportunities for multiyear growth. As a result of our solid first quarter results, strengthening in markets and confidence in our ability to safely execute, we have raised our full year revenue and earnings per share expectations for 2018.","Our Electric Power operations executed well in the first quarter, from both a top line and margin perspective. The strong performance was driven by solid execution across our operations, and we are particularly pleased with our execution in Canada through the winter season.","Additionally, we performed emergency restoration services during the first quarter in response to several severe winter storms. This work helped offset adverse work conditions on projects for both Electric Power, and Oil and Gas operations, caused by these storms. This is a good example of how Quanta's diverse services and geographic presence can mitigate risk from severe weather events to our overall results.","We continue to have a positive near and long-term outlook for our Electric Power segment because of our customers' multiyear, capital budgets continue to increase, and should remain robust for some time. Demand for our base business work is strong. Small and medium transmission and substation projects as well as distribution work remain active, and large multiyear MSA proposal activity is at high levels.","The low prices for an abundance of natural gas, the impact of tax reform and other favorable policy initiatives, are spurring plans to increase manufacturing and industrial activity in the United States, which should yield increasing demand for power in certain parts of the country.","The industrial market is a large user of power, and it's expansion is creating demand for base business work and larger transmission projects. The number of opportunities for larger transmission projects is increasing, with several larger projects, including the Wind Catcher Generation Tie Line making positive regulatory progress and getting closer to construction. Note that we do not have the Wind Catcher project in our backlog.","We believe our end markets are strengthening and continue to believe we are in earlier stages of an upper multiyear cycle. Long-term end market drivers such as the maintenance and replacement of aging infrastructure, generation mix shifting to more renewables and natural gas, grid modernization, and regulation aimed at improving greater liability, remain in place and are what we believe will continue to provide opportunities to grow our Electric business.","We are able to provide comprehensive turnkey solutions for these multiyear capital programs that we believe are unmatched in the industry. As we have said in the past, we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide solutions for these potential opportunities, which are the size and scope our industry has rarely experienced.","As many of you know, our communications operations are within our Electric Power segment, and last year we re-entered United States communications infrastructure services market. This initiative has been well received by our customers, and our U.S. communication operations continue to gain momentum. For example, during the first quarter, Quanta was selected by a large telecommunications company for turnkey engineering and construction services for farther deployment throughout a Tier 2 market in Texas. This deployment is designed to support the customer's existing 4G and developing 5G wireless networks, and the delivery of high-speed broadband services. We anticipate beginning this project later this year, with the completion anticipated by the end of 2020.","Importantly, we expect our U.S. communications operating income to be profitable in the second quarter, and believe we remain on track with our expectation to exit this year with operating income margins achieving high-single digit levels.","Turning to our Oil and Gas segment. We generated greater than expected revenues during the quarter, primarily driven by our natural gas distribution, pipeline integrity, and Canadian operations. Our industrial services operations performed well during the quarter, and they are recovering nicely from the severe impact of Hurricane Harvey on the Gulf Coast last year.","First quarter is seasonally a large quarter for our industrial services operations, and we are pleased with their performance. We believe their operations are on track to achieve the 2018 financial targets we have discussed on prior calls. Overall, operating income margins for this segment were within our previously discussed range in the quarter, and we believe would have exceeded the high end of the range without the adverse operating conditions caused by several winter storms.","We expect activity across our Oil and Gas segment to increase as we move through the year, due to the release of customer budgets, improved weather, and commencement of scheduled projects. We see opportunity for base business work to continue to grow over the coming years, which includes supporting midstream infrastructure, downstream industrial services, natural gas distribution, pipeline integrity, MSAs, pipeline logistics management, horizontal directional drilling, and engineering.","Since our fourth quarter earnings call, we have begun construction on several larger pipeline projects in the United States and feel incrementally comfortable with the timing of construction starts on our portfolio of pipeline projects. We believe our spread capacity in the lower 48 could be fully utilized by the end of the second quarter, or early in the third quarter of this year. Further, we are optimistic about the opportunity for market improvement in Canada for our midstream operations, and for our larger oil and natural gas and pipeline projects moving forward.","Looking forward, we also see opportunity for a robust overall pipeline market in 2019 and beyond. As natural gas mainlines from the Marcellus and Utica Shales are built and placed into service over the next couple of years to provide market access, we believe natural gas production will grow and our midstream operations in the Appalachian region will experience increased activity.","We're seeing multiple pipeline opportunities driven by LNG and petroleum export development in the United States and Canada and are well positioned to benefit from these growing markets.","The pipeline project we recently booked in Oklahoma and announced in our earnings release this morning is a good example of an LNG-driven opportunities for Quanta. Furthermore, I would note that LNG export industry development also provides opportunity for our electric power operations. These facilities require massive amounts of power and our decades of experience providing turnkey EPC high-voltage transmission and substation services to the processing and industrial industries in North America position us well to capture such opportunities.","Additionally, increasing oil and natural gas production in Texas is outstripping available pipeline capacity. We are actively building midstream infrastructure in West Texas and there are a number of pipeline projects in various stages of permitting and development to move oil and gas from West Texas to market.","We have strong midstream and mainline pipeline capabilities in Texas and other markets and are actively pursuing these opportunities. That said, we are diversifying and building our base-orientated services, which we expect to be the majority of the Oil and Gas segments revenues this year. We believe doing so will result in a more stable and consistent business profile over time that is less dependent on timing and cycles of larger pipeline projects.","Quanta has strategically focused on diversifying its operations across service lines and geographies in a very deliberate manner. This approach is designed to mitigate many aspects of risk in our business, including customer, project, permitting, geographic, execution, weather and other risk. We believe Quanta's diversity, scope and scale and capabilities are unique in our space and set us apart both competitively and as an investment.","Quanta is a construction-led infrastructure solutions provider whose portfolio of companies, services and geographic diversity position us to profitability grow through various cycles over time.","In summary, the year has started off well as a result of our solid first quarter results, strengthening end markets and confidence in our ability to safely execute, we have raised our full year revenue and earnings per share expectations. While project permitting and regulatory challenges remain, we continue to have a positive multiyear view on our end markets and believe we have strengthened our opportunities for multiyear growth.","We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and will continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset is the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders.","With that I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our first quarter results. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today we announced record first quarter revenues of $2.42 billion, an 11% increase as compared to the first quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to common stock was $37.6 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to net income attributable to common stock of $48.3 million or $0.31 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.40 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.39 for the first quarter of 2017.","Negatively impacting the quarter and reflected as adjustments in our adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation were acquisition and integration costs of $7.2 million, $6.2 million net of tax or $0.04 per diluted share attributable to common stock primarily associated with the two acquisitions completed during the quarter.","Electric Power revenues increased 28.6% when compared to the first quarter of 2017 to $1.57 billion with double-digit or near double-digit growth across all sub-segments of our Electric Power services. A larger increase was primarily due to higher customer spending associated with electric transmission projects and partially due to favorable performance and progress on a large electric transmission project in Canada. In addition, we have $23.8 million in incremental emergency restoration service revenues, approximately $18 million in revenues related to more favorable foreign currency exchange rates and approximately $15 million in revenues from acquired companies.","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment increased to 9% in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to 8.2% in the first quarter of 2017. This increase was due to higher segment revenues, including a higher proportion of electric transmission project revenues. Also contributing to the higher operating income and margins was the previously mentioned electric transmission project in Canada, which experienced favorable winter weather while we executed through established contingencies as well as incremental emergency restoration services during the quarter.","Aggregate communications infrastructure services operations, which are currently included within our Electric Power segment were slightly negative for the quarter, largely due to seasonality in our non-U.S. operations. We expect profitable operating performance for our aggregate communications operations for the rest of the year, with margins improving sequentially through the fourth quarter. Without the dilutive effect of the communications operations during the first quarter, Electric Power margins would've exceeded 9.5%.","Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue recognition guidance. While we do not anticipate any significant changes to the pattern of revenue recognition for our contracts, the new guidance requires a number of new disclosures.","Pursuant to this guidance, we are required to disclose, as of the end of each interim and annual period, the aggregate amount of the remaining performance obligations under our contracts with customers.","Our remaining performance obligations represent management's estimate of consolidated revenues expected to be realized from firm orders under fixed price contracts not yet completed, or for which work has not yet begun.","As of March 31, 2018, our remaining performance obligations were estimated to be approximately $5.19 billion, 80% of which is expected to be recognized in the 12 months subsequent to March 31, 2018.","Our remaining performance obligations have been included as a separate component of our historical backlog presentation as of the first quarter. Please see the supplemental data section of today's earnings release for a reconciliation of our historical backlog, which continues to be a non-GAAP measure to our remaining performance obligations which is now a GAAP measure.","As of March 31, 2018, 12 months non-GAAP backlog for the Electric Power segment was a record $4.2 billion, which was incrementally stronger as compared to the fourth quarter, and was an increase of 18% when compared to March 31, 2017.","Total backlog for the segment was $7.6 billion, which was an increase of 12% when compared to 1Q 2017. We believe these increases reflect the continued strength of our end market drivers and opportunities which Duke referenced in his comments.","Oil and Gas segment revenues decreased 11.4% quarter-over-quarter to $849.1 million in 1Q 2018. This decrease was primarily due to reduced capital spending by our customers on large diameter pipeline projects.","Last year, due to the timing of projects, we had several larger diameter pipeline projects in construction as compared to this year, where larger pipeline construction activities are not expected to begin until the second quarter. Partially offsetting this reduced spending were incremental acquisition revenues of approximately $155 million contributed by Stronghold.","Operating margin decreased to 1.2% in 1Q 2018 from 4% in 1Q 2017. This decrease in operating income and margin was primarily due to lower overall revenues in the segment, which negatively impacted resource utilization and the previously discussed lower proportion of larger diameter pipeline projects which typically yield higher margins.","These decreases were also due to the impact of severe weather on certain ongoing projects, which, as a result, experienced lower productivity. Although we mobilized various emergency restoration services crews within the Electric Power segment that contributed positively to the quarter, these same storms negatively impacted production on certain oil and gas projects with an estimated operating margin impact to the overall segment of as much as 100 basis points.","As of March 31, 2018, 12 month non-GAAP backlog for the Oil and Gas segment was $2.7 billion, which was an increase of 10.5% when compared to December 31, 2017 and an increase of 42% when compared to 12 month backlog at last year's first quarter.","Total backlog for this segment was $4.1 billion, which was an increase of 6.4% when compared to December 31, 2017 and an increase of 63.6% when compared to total backlog at last year's first quarter. We continue to see the opportunity for additional awards and expect our backlog levels can remain strong.","Corporate and non-allocated costs increased $12.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to 1Q 2017 primarily due to $7.2 million in higher acquisition-related costs. In addition, there were $4.8 million in higher compensation-related costs associated with increased personnel to support business growth and annual compensation increases as well as higher stock-based compensation expense due to lower forfeiture rates.","Also, we had $3.8 million in higher amortization expense related to intangible assets. These increases were partially offset by $4.2 million in reduced litigation costs associated with a matter involving our prior disposition of certain communications operations that we resolved in the first quarter of last year.","As a result of our segment performance, consolidated revenues increased $239.4 million or 11% when compared to the first quarter of 2017. Consolidated operating income in the quarter was comparable to the first quarter of last year. However, adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, grew 15% or $20.3 million to $156.6 million.","For the first quarter of 2018 cash flows provided by operating activities were $26 million and net capital expenditures were $61 million resulting in $35 million of negative free cash flow. This compares to negative free cash flow of $45.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. The improvements in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to lower working capital requirements related to lower levels of ongoing Oil and Gas Infrastructure projects. DSOs were 77 days at March 31, 2018, compared to 76 days at year-end and 78 days at the end of last year's first quarter.","Investing activities for the first quarter of 2018 included $30.7 million of net cash used for acquisitions, and financing activities included $214.6 million of net borrowings under our credit facility, which was partially utilized for share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased 5 million shares of our common stock for $173.9 million. Approximately $76 million of our current $300 million repurchase authorization remains unused.","At March 31, 2018, we had $102 million in cash. We had $447 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding, and we had $882 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with $583 million in total liquidity as of March 31, 2018.","Turning to our guidance. Due to our solid first quarter performance, strengthening end markets and improved visibility into the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2018 guidance. We now expect consolidated revenue to range between $9.95 billion and $10.55 billion. The increased range contemplates Electric Power segment revenues of $6 billion to $6.3 billion.","Due to the higher than forecasted level of revenues in this segment in the first quarter, we see sequential revenues being flat to rising slightly in the second quarter, revenues to be the highest in the third quarter, and the fourth quarter potentially to be the lowest revenue quarter for the Electric Power segment in 2018.","We believe second quarter margins will be comparable to last year's with operating margins growing to double-digits in the third and fourth quarters. We expect 2018 operating margins for the Electric Power segment to range between 9.5% and 10%, with our communications operations continuing to be slightly dilutive to our overall segment margins.","Our expectations for the Oil and Gas segment are unchanged from our year-end guidance discussion. We continue to see the possibility for segment revenues to grow 10% relative to 2017, the high-end of the range. We expect revenues and margins will improve in the second and third quarters, followed by a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. We anticipate Oil and Gas segment operating margins between 5.7% and 6.7% for the year.","We anticipate interest expense for the year to be approximately $31 million, due to slightly higher debt levels, partially attributable to share repurchase activity in the first quarter, as well as higher working capital requirements during the year to support increased revenue levels. As we have previously discussed, our other expense line item includes the deferral of a portion of the profit from construction activity on projects in which we have investments, primarily due to better than expected production on certain of those projects, we now expect the other expense line item to range between $30 million and $40 million for the year.","We are projecting our effective tax rate for 2018 to be between 29% and 29.5% for the year. These operating ranges result in net income between $321 million and $383 million and adjusted EBITDA between $815 million and $917 million for the full year of 2018. Due to the share repurchase activity in the first quarter, we are now assuming around 155 million weighted average shares outstanding for the year.","We are increasing our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the year to be between $2.07 and $2.47, and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $2.55 and $2.95. This increase in our annual guidance is partly associated with our first quarter performance, but also due to the strengthening view of the third and fourth quarters for our Electric Power segment.","Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share presented in our release, and please review the outlook expectation summary on our website for additional details. We believe our expected results for the year continue to reflect our opportunities for growth and our commitment to maintaining our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. We feel we are operationally and financially well positioned and continue to focus on our ability to execute on strategic initiatives.","This concludes our formal presentation, and we will now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Noelle Dilts with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Noelle Christine Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good morning. And I'm sure you'll hear this a lot today, but congratulations on a really nice quarter. So my first...","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thank you, Noelle.","Noelle Christine Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","My first question, I just wanted to dig into guidance a little bit more. When you look at the high-end of the guidance, can you just give us a sense of kind of what it takes to get there in terms of thinking about uncommitted work? Or is it really just that you have to execute well on the work you have right now?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, Noelle. I think from our standpoint, we haven't really changed the way we've looked at guidance other than the fact that we've had a quarter under our belt, and as you see the year and you see the macro markets, they're all strengthening. So it gives us a higher degree of confidence to the midpoint there. In the high end, we see, we still have some uncommitted. We're just starting on our gas season there on the large diameter pipe. Also our Canadian winter that's in front of us as well. So as we see that and we see us progress through that season, it'll allow us to get better visibility into the other side of the year.","So that's where the high end lies, is in the backside of the year.","Noelle Christine Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then as it relates to Stronghold, you had a couple \u2013 one competitor in particular talk about some continued disruption associated with the hurricane, so it was nice to see that you guys performed there, performed well there. Can you give us a sense of just maybe how some of the sub-businesses are performing? And what you think helped drive some of that recovery in what sounds like is a market that's still seeing some disruption?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yes. You know, the Stronghold acquisition, we felt like we bought a company that was necessary, the maintenance would get performed year-over-year and that's the case. And we bought exactly what we thought we did. They performed exactly like we thought. And we're extremely pleased. We also see lots of opportunities in that market, that space. We're not seeing the impacts that others may see. So, we're extremely pleased with how they performed and believe they'll perform the rest of the way and for the long-term for that matter. The management team is fantastic and our opportunities downstream just continue to come in.","Noelle Christine Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alan Fleming with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Duke, maybe you can help us understand or think about your margin guidance in Electric Power a little better. The nine percent you did was the highest 1Q we've seen in at least several years. I know there were some storm work in there, we know what your guidance is for the full year, but starting the year out this strong, and it seems like you're executing well. You have big projects like Fort McMurray continuing to ramp, so why wouldn't you be able to do closer to the midpoint of maybe of your 10% to 12% range this year, in a year where you base business is also growing, at least mid- to high-single digits?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, we've said it all along that we though the Electric Power business would be in double-digits this year and it will be, from what we see. And if it goes higher than that, we'll need some pull-in from storms and such. Again, we have telecom segment that reports through there, which Derrick can give you the impact on that. But we like the market, we like the macro market. We do think we're seeing more larger projects, we're bidding larger projects now, continue to see those verbal commitments and such.","So, we like where we sit. We don't have Wind Catcher in our guidance. If something like that was to go, it creates more upward end to the margin and upward end to guidance. So I'll let Derrick comment on the telecom.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, everything Duke said I agree with. To his point, I mean, as compared to previous periods, telecom is in our guidance at this point. It has some dilutive effect to that. When we get to the end of the year as the individual quarter, we think we'll be into upper high-single digit range of execution, but here in the first part of the year you're in the lower single digit range and so that's putting a dilutive effect to the overall year for Electric Power.","An additional point is, is that when you saw higher levels of margin in the past, we had a larger contribution of larger transmission projects. As it stands here today, we're executing only on, for 2018, a couple to three of those larger projects. In years past, we've been executing on as many as 9 or 10. So there's still a little bit of drag that's there for some underutilized equipment, whether that's coming from U.S. or Canada, so there's still an opportunity for margin expansion is there to the extent that we bring on additional large projects.","And then lastly, as Duke said, I mean, to the extent that we have the amount of growth that we have, you've got deployment of resources and G&A, and so as we look forward and think about the growth dynamics that are there, we think we'll have better absorption.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's good color. My follow-up is on Oil and Gas. Yeah. Obviously there's been some concern about delays in large pipeline projects with the recent change in FERC policy. So can you help demystify for us what you think your visibility is on mainline pipe over the next year or two? You know what the skepticism is, but do you think there's enough visibility for continued backlog growth in Oil and Gas, at least over the near to medium term?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, this is Duke. We see the projects out there, so the opportunities are there. You have your LNG takeaways. You're starting to see in Texas and Louisiana as well as in Canada, so we're starting to see some visibility in the LNG market, which takes a lot of pipe. They use a tremendous amount of gas. We are seeing the FERC ruling recently on MLPs where it disallows on a FERC line the tax benefit. So that is new. It's new information out there. I do not think it's changed, really the viewpoint that it's necessary to build pipe to these markets and they'll continue to build it.","It may be noisy for a quarter or two till they get it ironed out at FERC, but I do believe most of our customers are looking for venues. Either they're dissolving their MLPs, or whatever they're doing, to make sure that they can continue to build pipe to market and make sure that their rates assess the new provisions there from FERC.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, folks. Congrats on the quarter, and I assume the mix shift pipeline win for yourself.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. We got a good pipeline in Oklahoma. We're proud of it, so we're happy about the award.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah. So, just to get a little more granular, Duke, on the pipe side. It seems like there's some pretty big pipes tied to LNG coming forward. Your comments on Canada were interesting. Is the (sic) Coastal GasLink perhaps what's driving your enthusiasm there? Or generally would you assume that the LNG build-out which seems a little more solid now in Canada, is really leading to a larger, broader build-out that you're getting excited about?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, Tahira. I think if you look at it, there's a multitude of large projects out there. You have Keystone sitting out there, you have Line 3 sitting out there, you have Coastal, you have both Enbridge and TransCanada have lines that feed the LNG exports in Canada. So all those are lines that we're looking at, we're certainly around the edges on. But beyond that, I mean it takes a lot of feeder lines and a lot of short lines that feed out of those shelves into those larger pipes, so that also is something that interest us in our midstream market. So we're seeing all that come together. We kind of said in the past though, if we saw a bunch of LNG export, you would see us \u2013 the cycle elongate. So any of that, the old pipelines also get us somewhat more enthusiastic about the longevity of larger diameter pipe.","That being said, I really like our portfolio of companies that we have. I like how we're delivering on all the macro markets. So all that being said, just in general, I think our macro market and our ability and our earnings power of the company has never been greater. Our markets are continuing to strengthen, and I can't say it enough on all of our segments.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay, Duke. And then, obviously, the quarter is strong to really support that. And I guess as a follow-up to that, it's rare for you guys to raise guidance in the first quarter, so clearly a sign of the confidence you have. Going forward, as you look, what are the upside opportunities? It seems, obviously, Wind Catcher is one of them. But outside of Wind Catcher, would you say there are equal opportunities for guidance raises potentially for the rest of the year in both segments? Or are they more pronounced in one versus the other?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think, Tahira, we're looking at it long term. So if you just look at it, you look at it today, and you say our backlog's $11.7 billion.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","We're sitting on Wind Catcher and other awards in excess of $2 billion today. They're verbally (37:08) to proceed whatever it may be that we see that we could possibly be in backlog depending on how we look at the next quarter and the quarters beyond. So that being said, the markets are extremely strong.","Our base business, we've talked about it, growing single-digits. The CapEx, the OpEx of the utilities continue to grow. That's really what's driving the business is that 80% to 85% of that base business that continues to strengthen and now we're starting to see these larger projects layer on top of that and so the strength of the larger projects give us a lot of confidence in the outer years and this year included.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you, Duke.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Duncan with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Let me add my congratulations on a great quarter.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","So, Duke, on the Oil and Gas guidance specifically, you walked through what you're seeing kind of in every piece of that business, but you didn't change the guidance and your tone is certainly growing more positive. And if I remember correctly, your guidance in that segment assumes that large diameter revenue dollars are down year-over-year but you're saying you're going to be fully utilized with your large diameter spreads by the end of the second quarter or early in the third quarter.","Those things just don't seem to make a lot of sense together and then when I look through the rest of the business, demand for small pipe around the shales seems to be rising rapidly. You talked about that. You're also seeing good performance out of Stronghold and growth in that market. So can you just help us a little bit with the assumptions that are baked in to this Oil and Gas guide and what really does it take to take the range up? Is it as simple as we need to get to the end of the second quarter and make sure we're on track on these large diameter jobs? Or is there something else that we're missing?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. Matt, I mean, I think the year is somewhat inverse of last year where we had a large first quarter with Sabal Trail and we're able to give little bit more visibility on our Gas segment early. It's inverse to that this year where you're starting to see the back half with our season's more normal this year, so you're starting to see all of our spreads or starting construction now. We're getting more comfortable that they're going to get in construction.","We are in West Virginia with a bunch of work in other areas. There's risk to those \u2013 that work and contingencies. And as we get there, we get started, our productivity rates start to run. We can see it and get more visible on it, but I think I've said in the past on that type of work. We'll be cautious about how we guide it, but I think by the end of the next quarter we should be able to get more visibility in it and we'll take a different look at it but we're really just starting our big pipe season on the Gas business which will drive the upper end of any kind of guidance adjustment on the Gas side. So our season's just started. We gave you early guidance, and we're in the early stages of the Gas piece. But as a portfolio of the company, in general, just take the large diameter pipe out, we're strengthening across the board.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. So and then second question on that front. You talked about Stronghold. It sounds like the year is off to a good start. I really don't think you're getting any credit for what, to me, was a pretty smart acquisition. So can you give us an update on that business, on the outlook for that business? How much did it grow year-over-year in the first quarter? And then just downstream demand in general for your industrial services business. What does that look like?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Matt, I think the demand is there for sure. As far as what we've said, the $575 million to the $600 million, we'll stand by that as it sits today. They had a good first quarter, which is seasonally a big quarter for them and their own target for the year here. So we're pretty excited about where we sit. What they do from a service standpoint is certainly necessary in these refiners, as well as the downstream market.","So the company continues to take market share. Others are having issues. We continue to get people, superintendents, whatever it may be. Employer of choice. I really like the management team. We got what we thought we bought. We'll move forward with it. It's a great base revenue business. It allows us to diversify in our Gas segment. If we get some things, some different kind of weather in the first quarter, you would start to see that even in the first quarter. But I think as we move forward and we get the large diameter pipe that that piece of business really shines.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","To be clear, how much was it up year-over-year?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. What I'd say is, is that its \u2013 you're looking at double-digit growth. We had commented that historically they've been five, six years a compound annual growth rate of double-digit. When you look at run rate revenues, 2017 coming into 2018, we're seeing that same dynamic, double-digit for both the year, as well as the quarter.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys. Congrats again.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. And nice quarter. I guess two questions, probably more longer term. How do you guys think about the timeline to achieve the 10% medium to long-term margin target that you guys laid out at your Analyst Day. The revenues are clearly already exceeding that expectation. So how do we think about that? And what do we need to do to get there?","And then my second question too on the communications side, you talked about mid-single digit margins in the remainder of the year. How do we think about the revenue opportunity in 2019? And what does the revenue opportunity need to be so that this business isn't dilutive to total margins?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. Jamie, really, from our standpoint, all the business lines are strengthening. So when we talked about at the Analyst Day, we kind of laid out a $10 billion and $1 billion from an EBITDA standpoint, $10 billion and $1 billion of EBITDA is kind of was our goals and we still stay behind those goals. We're getting closer to the top line. We got to work on the bottom line, we know that from the margin profile.","So we talked about our Electric segment getting in double-digits this year; I think we'll be in there. We're growing a telecom business. It's how much growth we have underneath that also pulls down some of these margins. And as we look at the distribution business on the gas side, we talked about consolidating some offices, getting some strength out of those investments that we've made in distribution. We're getting that, we're seeing that. So I think every \u2013 all those businesses are starting to enhance our whole portfolio, but I do think you need to look at Quanta as a portfolio of companies which gives us great strength as we move forward.","You've seen it this quarter in a storm where one division or one segment may get hit a little bit, but we have a storm and you get this impact of a storm. So the portfolio of companies and the way that we're using our specialized skilled labor, the 35,000 plus or running on 40,000 that'll get out there, it's how we're doing that and the solutions we're providing in a portfolio, that allows the earnings power and the growth of the company over the long term. And I think to put it in a little segment or a big segment for that matter, it's the whole company that's moving forward.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. But three versus five years as we sit here in the growth trajectory that you have? Not to put you on the spot, but...","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Well, I mean we've set $10 billion and $1 billion in our guidance, is already at $10 billion. Take out Stronghold at the high end, I mean, the opportunity to certainly get to the $10 billion; can we get to the $1 billion? We need to execute through contingencies. We need to see some larger projects come in. But I'm not saying we can't even get there this year. I mean it's a stretch, obviously, at the high end to get to the $1 billion.","I'd give it three year's timeframe.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","We see that the growth on the base business. We've said in the past that if you take out the large projects, which we can't control, we'll growth in the high-single digits on the base business, which is 80% to 85% of the business. So if you take that growth rate, I can't tell you exactly where the large projects are going to fall. I just said that verbally or from an LNTP or Wind Catcher or whatever it may be, you're sitting on another $2 billion of backlog, so at least.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research","Thanks. Good morning. Wondering if you could talk about what the mix of large transmission revenues has been in the Electric segment over the last 12 months and what's the burn of it over the next 12 months? I'm really just trying to get a sense of how long you can go before you really need to book a Wind Catcher type project before it kind of becomes noticeable that you don't have a lot of large electric transmission project in there.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, Steve, we've been running at \u2013 for Electric Power with base business in the probably 80% to 90% range now for quite some time for Electric Power. As we look forward to total contribution to 2018, I would anticipate it's going to be in that same kind of range, in that 80% to 90% range overall. The larger projects that we have today run really through, call it, the early to mid-2019.","But from Duke's commentary, we continued to see opportunities for additional project awards and so I would anticipate this time next year, you can still yet see something that's in that 80% to 90% range of base business with continuing to have contributions from larger transmission projects.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research","Okay. Great. And then, not sure if you mentioned it or not, but how much did acquisitions add to backlog? And I see that you have more M&A costs embedded in your guidance for the full year. I mean, this small amount relative to what you've incurred already, so just kind of wondering what your future M&A plans are and what the strategy is there.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","M&A to backlog from the first quarter was fairly nominal, call it around $20 million or so. Remember that the two acquisitions, one was a small electric power company and then the other one was actually the (sic) Northwest Lineman College which is a smaller component of overall backlog. And then relative to \u2013 on a go-forward basis, I mean, we continue to be opportunistic looking at M&A across Electric Power, Oil and Gas, Canada, U.S., Australia. We do think that there are still yet a number of opportunities that are out there and that we continue to explore looking for ways to add strategically to the overall portfolio.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So help me understand the change in your Oil and Gas guidance for 2Q through 4Q? After the fourth quarter, your implied guidance was $3.4 billion for that time period, but now it looks like it steps down to about $3.25 billion. So just wanted to understand is, what's driving that weakness if I'm reading that correctly.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, I think that we're saying that as it stands here today, our guidance as of the beginning of the year really remains unchanged. We're really looking forward to the second quarter and mobilizing on the individual project themselves. So I would say the low and high of our revenue expectations as well as margin expectations remain the same. We had a little bit higher revenue here in the first quarter maybe than we were originally looking at, but that was just the standpoint of continuing to work through projects. The dilution associated with that was the headwind from the storm work, which offset that. So, effectively, as we stand here today, the second, third and fourth quarter dynamics for us are still remaining unchanged to our expectations as to the beginning of the year. And we'll \u2013 I think we'll have a lot better visibility when we get to the second quarter on \u2013 from a confidence perspective, as well as narrowing of the range.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And as I look at my pipeline tracker, the center of gravity is definitely shifting more towards the Permian, which tends to be more open shop. So, can you remind us how many open shop spreads you have under (49:35), maybe even like the revenue capacity with that business?","Also, do you think you can grow your mainline backlog or at least keep it flat exiting 2018, 2019? And then lastly, how do you think about when LNG actually materializes as a kind of a large scale pipeline opportunity, do you think you'll be more like a construction phase in 2019 or it will be more of an award phase in 2019 for that?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. So just in Texas we do see a lot of activity in the Permian, both union and non-union, on those larger diameter pipes you can do that work. But again, we can run a couple of spreads, non-union there, on large diameter pipe with our non-union activity. So, yes, we are seeing that. We do see the opportunities there in the mainline. The large projects are lumpy, as you know. So, again, and when they go into backhaul, can we back fill it? It will just be a lumpy progress, how we look at it.","So I can't tell you exactly how that'll come in. There's certainly the opportunity for us to maintain that level through 2019. It just \u2013 we don't know when those projects come into RFQ, RFI type timeframes. So it will be difficult for us to kind of give you exactly when they'll hit backlog. But the opportunities and what we're seeing and the robustness of the market, we're certainly having great discussions with our customers for 2019 and beyond.","And the LNG export, as we've talked about, really it impacts Canada, Texas. It's broad-based. And your midstream business also comes back as \u2013 when you get this takeaway capacity in Appalachian. It allows that midstream business to come in. And that's not easy work, and it's big diameter work even. You're talking 16, 24-inch pipe coming in through the mountains of West Virginia. So that's good work for us. And so we're pleased that you'll start to see that come back as well. So shell plays certainly fill up these big pipes for our LNG export. The liquids are there as well, coming out of the oil sands. And so we're pretty excited about that market long term.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. When's the last time you were fully utilized with your long haul oil and gas spreads?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think you \u2013 that becomes difficult because we can do two projects in one year, we can do a multitude of different things. So just to say, hey, when are you at capacity, depends on where the projects are. And when you're in the mountainous regions, there's only a finite number of spreads that can work through the Rockies or even through kind of in the Appalachian region, so. That being said, it's difficult.","I don't think we're turning down work by any means, and I'm not sure that we ever have in certain areas. Depending on the project, depending on where it's at, we're certainly capable of booking work at this point. But in the U.S., from our standpoint, on our mountain spreads, on the tough, rough terrain, I believe we'll be at capacity in the third quarter.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Okay. Yeah. That just struck me as an interesting comment from your prepared remarks. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about on the telecom side, the city that you won, curious if there's additional cities up for grabs and if you see backlog continuing to build in that segment?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yes and yes. I do think that it's a matter for us, we're starting it from an organic standpoint for the most part, so our ability to get qualified, craft skilled labor and deploy them in the field as quickly as possible and least expensively as possible is something that we're striving to do.","We made the (sic) Northwest Lineman acquisition. We were able to have telecom curriculum take those guys, put them in the field fairly rapidly. We really like that acquisition. I can't say enough about how much that does for us from training and craft skilled labor and new markets, and certainly from an organic growth standpoint, the opportunity is there. We could book work daily, we could book more and more backlog, we could double our backlog. It depends on how quickly we can get people to the field and perform. And I'm more concerned with our performance and making sure that we create the value that we said we would for our customers and deliver. So we're going to be cautious about how we deploy and how quickly we do, but certainly the opportunities are there. The market's very good.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Good to hear. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of (sic) Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I think I just have one for today and it has to do with the electric transmission market. And it looks like it wasn't just you guys that had kind of good awards and good results here in the quarter, but the other two public competitors also had really strong bookings. I was wondering, with that as the backdrop, Duke, are you seeing that the market is tightening in any capacity as you move here through 2018? And is there any implications on the pricing or terms that you're taking on in the market today as you look forward?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","No. We've said in the past, it's really about utilization for us. The market it'll bear a certain amount of return and then it's about utilization and how well we can fully utilize our equipment, people, and resources. The market's there. I've said it over and over. If you look at the CapEx, OpEx spends of the 20 (55:31) they continue to exponentially grow. I can't \u2013 the elongation, we're in very early stages. We talk about these segments and these being in 10-year cycles. I mean we're very early stages of an upward cycle in the Electric business and it's all about replacement, grid modernization. We're doing all this without very negative low growth for that matter for the most part and most regions are at least flat.","So as you start to see any type of industrial load growth, things like that creates these larger transmission projects and layers on top of this, but we continue to provide solutions to our customers that make sense and we're real happy with where we sit there. Our guys in the field are doing a fantastic job from a performance standpoint. I can't say enough about the management team we have there and where we sit. Our long-term outlook there is certainly strong.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with FBR & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Thank you. Nice quarter, gentlemen.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thank you, Alex.","Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Derrick, can you remind us what portion of your revenue is coming out of Canada and maybe help to frame how big that business is today relative to the past peak either from a revenue standpoint or a margin standpoint so we can think about what the upside of that business is over the next couple of years.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. As it stands, Canada is still running probably in the 15% to 20% range. Of that, that's about the same mix whether you look at Electric or telecom or Oil and Gas. It really runs pretty consistent across the lot of it. Relative to where it's been in the past peak, that's hard to answer on because of the fact that over five years ago, I mean we've continued to acquire companies in Canada. Five years ago we didn't necessarily have as much of an oil and gas presence as we do today through acquisitions. So ultimate contributions I'd say are larger today than they were five years ago. I'm not sure I can provide really any other color than that.","Going forward, I'd tell you that we continue to also see growth opportunities in Canada comparable to what we see in U.S. for both Electric Power and Oil and Gas. And we continue to see large pipe project opportunities in Canada. So it's a growing part of our business and I would say that comparable to U.S. with the double-digit growth. I'd say maybe next year and the year after you might see it in that 20% range.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","I would agree with that. I mean I think the U.S. grows too, so I think it stays in that range, but the large \u2013 we're depressed a bit on our large pipe market as it sits right now in our outlook. If that strengthens, certainly Canada would strengthen as well. (58:28) you also have some FX there as well that was in the past the dollar \u2013 Canadian dollar was a little stronger, so.","Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about cost inflation broadly? I mean, obviously you got fuel inflation, labor inflation, materials are inflating; how is that affecting your business and your margin and how is that affecting your customers' decision process?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, the things that I watch the closest is interest rates and things like that. We're able to kind of keep wage inflation on the Electric side around 3%, 3.5%, something like that. That's where it will iron out. That's what the market bears. The Gas side on these larger diameter projects, certainly, the labor will move. It'll get bouncy on you, so we take all that into account when we're looking forward on these projects. And taken in \u2013 we typically don't take material inflation, things like commodity inflation. So fuel is the only thing that'll move a bit, but we're not seeing any kind of crazy numbers there. We're in pretty good shape. We like where we're at.","Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","And as it relates to the customers' decision process, obviously some of their material costs are going higher; has it affected it at all?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","No. I mean, we have not seen that year. Certainly, everybody would \u2013 the steel kind of tariff announcement, this and that, everybody's kind of struggling on what that means, but we've not \u2013 everybody's kind of getting around what that says and what that means. I think in general, the market's pretty stable and everybody is adapting to regulation, whether it be tax rebate or increases in steel tariff. As long as we have good visibility and understand it and understand what's coming out of it from a regulatory aspect, the industry tends to adapt.","Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","It's helpful. Thank you.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.","Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Good morning. Couple of quick wrap-up questions. Did, Derrick, the other expense line item, the $20 million to $30 million previously I think is now $30 million to $40 million. Would you expect that to alleviate as we get into next year or kind of hold at these sort of levels?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","I think that as we go forward we'll continue to have other types of investments. We've said in the past that, that's a component of our business that we continue to pursue, strategic investments and the like. So I think that \u2013 whether it be 2019 or 2020, I'd have a level of expectation that's in there. From a size perspective, that \u2013 it's hard to say. But as it stands right now, I'd probably say that I'd be backing off on that number a little bit going into 2019 compared to 2018.","Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And then maybe following up on some prior questions. Obviously, great margin this quarter in the Power business. It wasn't quite clear to me though because you lost a little bit of work, weren't able to execute on some work you thought you could. But you got the benefit of storm work. I guess net-net, was the storm work in that positive margins in the quarter versus the business you lost?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yes.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","And some of that's difficult to say, because just the way that it irons out whether it's more positive or not. But definitely from the segment standpoint it is accretive to the segment, the storm margins.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","It's just generally hard to quantify exactly what the contribution is. But we do find it to be accretive to the margins for the quarter.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","It's utilization, the guys are working long hours to get more utilization out of the equipment, such.","Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Got it. Great quarter. Best of luck.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Jim?","James F. O'Neil","Thank you, Kip, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Quanta Services First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with an operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our first quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","","Revenues in the first quarter increased approximately 7% as compared to last year's first quarter. However, earnings per share came in below our expectations. Our earnings shortfall was due to several factors. The largest contributor was various weather dynamics occurring throughout Canada on several major electric transmission projects. We experienced an early fall in Alberta, continuous heavy snow in Newfoundland and dense fog in northern Saskatchewan.","In our previous estimates for the quarter, we had considered weather effects on these projects. However, in each of these areas, the impact to our production was more prolonged than expected. Other factors that impacted our first quarter results, as well as details about our annual guidance, which we revised downward to take into account the first quarter results, will be covered by Derrick in detail in his commentary.","Despite the challenging quarter, we believe the industry drivers that have fueled the electric power segment's growth over the past several years have not changed and will continue for at least the next several years. For example, according to a report released last week from the WIRES Group, since 2010, U.S. transmission investment has ranged from $10 billion to $16 billion per year. And despite year-to-year fluctuations, transmission spending is forecasted to remain at high levels through the year 2030.","Our utility customers have made significant investment in their electric power infrastructure throughout North America, and we expect continued strong levels of investment by utilities in transmission and distribution infrastructure going forward. Most of our top industrial and utility customers have forecasted an increase in their capital spending on transmission and distribution infrastructure over the next several years. Additionally, the size, scope and complexity of projects are increasing.","We anticipated this change in market dynamics and have positioned our company to capitalize on these trends. As a result, we have been awarded transmission projects such as Nalcor's Muskrat Falls and Labrador-Island Link projects in the Fort McMurray West concession in Alberta. The aggregate contracted revenue of these projects is in excess of $2 billion. We expect additional projects of similar magnitude in both Canada and the United States in the coming years as North America's electric grid will continue to be developed for years, if not decades.","For example, we are encouraged by the California Independent [indiscernible] Operators or Cal ISO's Energy Imbalance Market initiative that was announced earlier this month and other efforts that will require grid solutions to deal with the intermittent generation resources in the western United States. We believe Cal ISO's initiatives will result in the construction of major transmission programs designed to interconnect western states to enhance reliable power delivery in the region, which should create a significant number of opportunities for Quanta.","","Despite this robust activity, the sighting and permitting of energy infrastructure, including major electric transmission programs, continues to be our customers' biggest challenge. And we are encountering delays on certain projects that we previously expected to be awarded and moved to construction in the second half of 2015. These delays have impacted our electric power segment growth rate expectations for this year, but do not change our overall positive multi-year outlook for growth potential of this market. The regulatory environment can delay projects and create pauses in our growth rate from time to time. However, we do not believe electric infrastructure spending has peaked, and we do believe we are still in a multi-year growth cycle. While it is frustrating when project delays happen, typically, it's not a question if the project will move forward, but when.","While large transmission projects are high profile and attract a lot of attention, we continue to seize opportunities to provide services in the sub transmission market that address system reliability, substation hardening and the replacement of aging infrastructure. We have visibility into a healthy mix of sub transmission and major transmission project opportunities on the horizon. In addition, our distribution services continue to grow as customers increase spending to upgrade aging infrastructure and to hardened systems to better withstand extreme weather events. Third-party industry market data and our discussions with key customers support our belief that our electric power segment remains in a multi-year growth environment. And we remain confident in our view that revenues and backlog will continue to increase over the next several years.","Turning your attention to our oil and gas infrastructure segment. Revenues increased nicely compared to the same period last year, and operating margins were favorable in what is typically a seasonally challenging quarter for the oil and gas infrastructure segment. We continue to have a positive outlook for the mainline pipe market for at least the next 3 to 5 years. Our customers' capital programs in this market are significant. And we believe the number of mainline pipe projects that can move to construction this year and over the next several years is larger than we have ever seen since Quanta entered the mainline business. A substantial majority of these mainline pipe projects have already secured contractual commitments for producers on a minimum volume or take-or-pay contracts and should move forward towards construction, assuming required permits and approvals are obtained.","A noteworthy pipeline project that we secured in the first quarter is our turnkey engineering procurement and construction, or EPC, contract with SemGroup Corporation for the Maurepas Pipelines Project in Louisiana. Engineering, permitting, right-of-way acquisition and material procurement has commenced for this project, and construction is expected to begin in the third quarter of 2015 with completion expected in the third quarter of 2016. Once completed, the pipeline system should enable local refineries to integrate and optimize their operations and should provide the refineries with pipeline access to domestically produced crude oil. This project is a good example of how the decline in oil prices can increase downstream demand for oil and have a positive impact on demand for new pipeline infrastructure.","Also this morning, I am pleased to announce that Quanta has recently been selected by Columbia Pipeline Group, a business unit of NiSource Inc., for segment 2 of a major natural gas pipeline project. Our scope of work includes right-of-way clearing and the construction of approximately 46 miles of new 36-inch diameter natural gas mainline pipe in Ohio and West Virginia. Right-of-way clearing is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2017. Mainline pipe construction is expected to begin in the spring of 2017 with project completion expected in the fourth quarter of 2017.","","We achieved record backlog of $2.68 billion in our oil and gas infrastructure segment at the end of the first quarter. We expect backlog to remain healthy throughout 2015 in this segment, as we anticipate sizable mainline pipeline awards this year potentially offsetting the delays of certain electric power transmission project contract awards that I mentioned earlier. Additionally, we believe the increase in mainline project activity in 2015 will more than offset any decline in revenues we may experience in certain markets due to lower oil prices. As a result, we anticipate revenues and operating income growth in the oil and gas infrastructure segment this year.","","Regarding our fiber optic licensing operations, as announced this morning, we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell our fiber optic licensing operations to Crown Castle International for approximately $1 billion in cash, subject to various regulatory approvals and other customary conditions prior to closing. We expect the transition to close by the end of this year. I would like to thank all of our fiber optic licensing operation employees for their contribution to our organization over the past years. This transaction enables us to enhance our strategic focus on energy infrastructure markets, which we continue to believe will undergo substantial development in the coming years. The purchase price represents a 15x trailing EBITDA multiple, which recognizes the significant value these operations have created as part of Quanta.","","Sunesys provided Quanta growth opportunities at high margins and a differentiated service offering, which has always been appealing to Quanta. Since our acquisition of Sunesys in 2007, the business has more than tripled in size. Although we have continued to pursue various strategic initiatives within this space to continue to create incremental value, we have been mindful of the increasingly competitive environment and market activity and felt that ultimately, a more appropriate owner could better serve the growth opportunities for Sunesys. With that in mind, we concluded that the proceeds we will receive in this transaction offered our shareholders more certainty versus a changing market environment that added risk to Quanta's potential execution, and we are pleased to have reached an agreement with Crown Castle.","","In summary, while our full year guidance was revised downward, primarily to take into account the shortfalls that occurred in the first quarter, we remain confident that the industry drivers of our electric power and oil and gas infrastructure segments remain intact. In 2015, we anticipate some headwinds in our electric power segment, primarily due to project delays associated with the regulatory environment. However, we believe any softness in the electric power segment this year could be offset by the robust environment for our oil and gas infrastructure segment, driven by mainline pipe opportunities. We continue to expand and develop our employee base and broaden our service offerings to meet our customers' growing needs. And we are executing on strategies that differentiate Quanta and position the company for both near- and long-term growth. Finally, the definitive agreement to sell our fiber optic licensing operations comes at an opportune time. It will enable us to enhance our strategic focus on energy infrastructure markets, which we believe will undergo substantial development in the coming years.","","With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our financial results. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.89 billion for the first quarter of 2015 compared to $1.76 billion in the prior year's first quarter, reflecting an increase of 7.1% in quarter-over-quarter revenues.","Net income attributable to common stock for the quarter was $53.5 million or $0.25 per diluted share as compared to $54.4 million or $0.25 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year. Included in net income attributable to common stock for the first quarter of 2014 was an aggregate $38.8 million or $25.8 million net of tax of incremental selling, general and administrative expense associated with an adverse arbitration decision regarding a contract dispute on a directional drilling project that occurred in 2010. The net impact of this decision on our first quarter 2014 results was a $0.12 reduction in diluted earnings per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes this and certain other items as presented in today's press release, was $0.31 for the first quarter of 2015 as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.44 for the first quarter of 2014.","Before I get into the broader financial discussion, I'd like to provide a bit more color on our performance against expectations for the quarter. Our lower-than-expected results can be categorized primarily in 3 components: the largest component is the impact on production of the various weather factors in Canada, which Jim noted in his comments. Our previous first quarter guidance of $0.31 to $0.37 per diluted share considered these factors. However, the number of days of productivity impacted for certain projects was as much as 2 to 3x our original estimates. We would estimate that these impacts were roughly half of the shortfall against our expectations for the quarter. An additional project-related variance was a power plant project, which we've recorded at breakeven margins during the quarter as compared to our typical electric power margins. Lastly, largely due to the weather impacts of the first quarter, our ratio of expected earnings from foreign operations, to total earnings for the year is now lower, which has the effect of increasing our overall tax rate for the year. The combination of the impact from the power plant project and the change in the effective tax rate for the quarter was roughly $0.03. We are currently evaluating potential change orders or claims in response to certain aspects of these projects' circumstances. However, none will reflect in our first quarter results.","Turning to a discussion of the broader release, the increase in consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the same quarter last year was primarily due to a 39.3% increase in revenues from our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment, partially offset by a 4.1% decrease in revenues from our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. Quantifying the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates between the quarters, consolidated revenues and earnings were negatively impacted by approximately 4% when compared to the first quarter of last year.","Our consolidated gross margin was 13.4% in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to 15.4% in the first quarter of 2014. This decrease was primarily due to the negative operational impacts I described previously.","Selling, general and administrative expenses as presented in this quarter's earnings release were $150.2 million in the first quarter of 2015, reflecting an increase of $15.8 million as compared to the first quarter of 2014. This increase is primarily due to $7.3 million in incremental G&A costs associated with acquired companies and approximately $2.9 million in higher compensation and incentive costs associated with current levels of operations and $2.3 million in higher costs associated with ongoing technology and business development initiatives.","Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 8% in the first quarter 2015 as compared to 7.6% in the first quarter of 2014. This increase is primarily attributable to the reduced revenues associated with foreign currency exchange rates and its impact on the absorption of consolidated overhead costs.","","Our consolidated operating margin before amortization expense was 5.4% for 1Q '15 and compares to a 5.6% consolidated operating margin before amortization expense in 1Q '14, which was impacted by 220 basis points due to the arbitration expense in the prior year.","","Amortization of intangible assets increased to $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2015 from $8.2 million in 1Q '14, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions that have closed since the first quarter of last year.","To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues were $1.23 billion, reflecting a decrease of $52.4 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 4.1%. Revenues during the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $32 million as a result of the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014. In addition, due to normal fluctuations in project timing, certain larger projects were ongoing in last year's first quarter, which were at or near completion by the first quarter of this year. Lastly, emergency restoration revenues decreased approximately $17.7 million [ph] quarter-over-quarter to $19.5 million. This decrease was offset by approximately $20 million in incremental revenues from companies acquired subsequent to the first quarter of last year.","Operating margin in the electric power segment decreased to 8.8% in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to 11.3% in last year's first quarter, primarily due to the effects outlined in my previous comments.","Sequentially as of March 31, 2015, 12-month and total backlog for the electric power segment decreased by 4.6% and 3.9%, largely as a result of an approximate $140 million decrease due to changes in currency rates.","Oil and Gas segment revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by $175.2 million or 39.3% to $621.1 million in 1Q '15, largely as a result of revenue contributions of approximately $130 million from companies acquired subsequent to the first quarter of last year, but additionally from strong organic growth associated with increased capital spending by our customers. Partially offsetting these increases is the negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the first quarter '15 as compared to the first quarter '14, [indiscernible] estimated to have negatively impacted revenues by approximately $33 million. Also partially offsetting the increase in revenues is the reduction in demand for some of our services due to the recent decline in oil prices.","Operating income for the Oil and Gas segment as a percentage of revenues increased to 3.9% in 1Q '15 from negative 4.7% in 1Q '14. This increase was primarily due to the impact in the prior year for the arbitration expense mentioned previously, which negatively impacted the segment by 870 basis points in the first quarter of 2014.","The 12-month and total backlog for the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment increased sequentially by 2.1% and 6.3%. Backlog for this segment is at the highest level since we have identified it as an operating segment.","I will comment later in my prepared remarks on the disposition of our fiber licensing operations. But as far as the first quarter's performance, our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment revenues were up $1.6 million or 4.1% to $40.1 million in 1Q '15 as compared to $38.5 million in 1Q '14 due to higher levels of ancillary telecommunication service revenues.","Operating margin decreased to 28.7% in 1Q '15 as compared to 31.4% in 1Q '14, primarily due to a change in [indiscernible] the higher proportion of revenues derived from ancillary telecommunication services as well as incremental lit fiber activities, both of which typically carry lower margins versus dark fiber services.","Corporate and non-allocated costs increased $5 million in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to 1Q '14, primarily as a result of $3.8 million in higher compensation and incentive costs, $1.7 million higher costs associated with ongoing technology and business development initiatives and $1.2 million in higher consulting and professional fees. These increases were partially offset by $3.2 million in lower acquisition and integration costs.","","EBITA for the first quarter of 2015 was $97.5 million or 5.2% of revenues compared to $95.1 million or 5.4% of revenues for the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA was $153 million or 8.1% of revenues for the first quarter of 2015 compared to $185.6 million or 10.5% of revenues for the first quarter of 2014. The calculation of EBITA, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are all non-GAAP measures. And the definitions of these and day sales outstanding or DSO can be found in the Investors & Media section of our website at quantaservices.com.","For the first quarter of 2015, cash flow provided by operations was approximately $189 million. And net capital expenditures were approximately $65 million, resulting in approximately $124 million of free cash flow as compared to negative free cash flow of approximately $130 million for the first quarter of 2014. The increase in free cash flow was primarily driven by the timing of the collection of various receivables, including $65 million associated with the previously delayed payments on the Sunrise Powerlink Project as well as lower taxes payable due to the charge to provision for long-term contract receivables in 2014 and its impact on our 2015 estimated tax payment as well as reduced incentive compensation payments based upon the company's performance against incentive metrics in 2014 as compared to 2013.","DSOs are flat at 83 days at March 31, 2015 compared to 83 days at December 31, 2014 and 80 days at March 31, 2014.","","Investing cash flows during the first quarter of 2015 were impacted by aggregate cash consideration paid of approximately $34.7 million net of cash acquired related to 3 acquisitions closed during the quarter. Financing cash flows during the first quarter of 2015 were impacted by the repurchase of 6.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $182 million.","","At March 31, 2015, we had approximately $135.5 million in cash, with approximately $103.8 million in U.S. funds and $31.7 million relating to our foreign operations. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we had about $328.5 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments. And we had $106.4 million of borrowings in Canada outstanding under our credit [ph] facility. Including our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we had nearly $1 billion in total liquidity as of March 31, 2015.","","Concerning our outlook for 2015, we expect revenues for the second quarter to range between $1.95 billion and $2.05 billion, and diluted earnings per share to be $0.36 to $0.42 on a GAAP basis. These estimates compare to revenues of $1.86 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.37 in the second quarter of 2014. Our GAAP EPS forecast for the second quarter of 2015 includes an estimate of $10.6 million for noncash stock-based compensation expense and $8.9 million for amortization expense. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2015 is expected to be $0.42 to $0.48 and compares to our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.43 in the second quarter of 2014.","Specific weather dynamics that impacted certain projects in the first quarter have, to an extent, carried over into the beginning of the second quarter, such that we currently do not expect to be able to make up for lost productivity and we have factored that into our estimates for the second quarter.","On an annual basis, we expect revenues to range between $8.1 billion and $8.5 billion. And we currently anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year to be between $1.70 to $1.90. In addition, we estimate $41.5 million for noncash stock-based compensation expense and $35.5 million for amortization expense for the full year of 2015 and anticipate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $1.94 to $2.14. Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release.","We lowered our annual guidance primarily due to the impact of the first quarter shortfall in EPS. However, the additional factor contributing to our reduced guidance is the overall increase in our annual effective tax rate. Our current expectations for the year is for a smaller proportion of our earnings to be earned in Canada, which has a lower tax rate as compared to earnings in the United States. This change in the proportion of foreign earnings increased our estimated effective tax rate for the year by as much as 200 basis points, which had the effect of lowering our annual EPS expectation by as much as $0.06. We are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate to be between 36% and 36.5% for 2015.","As a result of some of the project delays Jim referred to, at the midpoint of our guidance for the year, we see electric power revenue showing flat to modest growth. As a reminder, this forecast takes into consideration the current foreign exchange rate environment as compared to 2014, which results in a reduction of 3% to 5% when comparing the annual period. Also similar to our year-end commentary, we are holding our estimated operating margin guidance for the year to 10% to 11% in the Electric Power segment, which reflects our expectation to perform within the 10% to 12% range in the third and fourth quarters of this year.","","For the Oil and Gas segment, as Jim commented, oil price uncertainty has created incremental softness in demand for certain of our services. And as such, the midpoint of our range now reflects operating margin slightly lower than 9%, and our midpoint revenue guidance requires no incremental mainline pipe project starts for this year.","","For additional guidance, we expect net income attributable to noncontrolling interest to be approximately $1.3 million in the second quarter of 2015. However, these JV relationships wind down by the middle of the year, and therefore, we expect no noncontrolling interest deduction in the latter half of 2015.","","We currently estimate our diluted share count to be about 215 million shares for the year. Both the second quarter and annual 2015 guidance reflect the current foreign exchange rate environment. Continued movement in -- for foreign currency rates in the future could make comparisons to prior periods difficult.","","We expect CapEx for all of 2015 to be approximately $275 million to $305 million when factoring in 2015-to-date acquisitions, which includes CapEx for our Fiber Licensing and Other segment of about $50 million to $60 million without regard to the planned disposition of these operations later this year. This compares to CapEx for all of 2014 of $301 million.","","I'll now turn my commentary to a discussion of our announcement to divest of our fiber optic licensing operations. As discussed in today's release, we entered into an agreement to divest of these operations subsequent to the end of the first quarter for approximately $1 billion in gross proceeds. We currently estimate net proceeds from the transaction to be approximately $800 million. We expect to record a gain upon closing of the transaction. However, as the timing of the close is uncertain, my previous guidance comments include the contribution of the fiber operations as though we maintain their operations through the entire year. As such for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2015, Quanta's fiber licensing operations are estimated to generate approximately $105 million to $110 million in revenue and contribute $0.12 to $0.13 in diluted earnings per share.","The transaction was committed to in the second quarter, and we will be evaluating whether to treat the operations as assets held for sale as part of our second quarter reporting. In any event, upon closing, the results of operations would be expected to be treated as discontinued operation, at which time we will provide supplemental information to restate previous periods for comparability.","","We believe there is opportunity to create incremental shareholder value with the proceeds from this transaction by our repurchasing our stock, acquiring energy infrastructure services companies and\/or making strategic investments. We will continue to evaluate all of the opportunities we could -- we believe could create shareholder value going forward. However, we expect to use the proceeds for a combination of these purposes. As a reminder of our recent activity in these regards, through the date of this call, we have invested approximately $322 million in cash to acquire companies and approximately $275 million in cash to repurchase stock since January 1, 2014. We currently have $225 million available under our current stock repurchase program. Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and repurchases of Quanta stock.","This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Jim, first question for you. Given the confidence you have on your -- the momentum in your core markets, clearly, your stock is undervalued. So as you look at the opportunity with the fiber optic sale and really how you see investments, would your stock not be the best investment? And when we look at that $800 million in net proceeds you'll be getting from there, would it -- can you at least try to give us a bit of an idea of how much of a chunk of that could potentially go towards the acquisition at this point -- sorry, towards repurchases at this point?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I'm going to let Derrick talk about that briefly. I'll just say that the uses of capital, we've got the significant amount of working capital to fund on pipeline projects. There's M&A activity and certainly, there's an opportunity to buy back stock. So I don't think there's going to be much change in use of capital, at least the strategy for our uses of capital, but I'll let Derrick add some additional commentary.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, Tahira, I agree with Jim's comments. I mean, although we do see opportunities there, you can see with our original repurchase program that we've used a good portion of that all the way through the first quarter of this year. And we have $225 million remaining under that program to date. So we obviously see that being one of the uses of capital and a good use of capital. Having said that, M&A and investments we still believe are significant contributor, and in fact, we believe create greater long-term value. And so we will still be looking at that. We still consider ourselves to be an acquisitive company. But I think it will be a combination of those things, is what you'll see. And we'll be opportunistic at how we balance those based upon the M&A and investment-type pipeline, looking back and forth between that versus capital repurchase. The other thing I'll comment that although we announced the transaction today, it's still subject to regulatory approval, and there's a timing issue to when that may close. And although we anticipate a very low risk to closing, there is still a bit of risk to that. And I think that she -- we will be, in our minds, a little premature to make a significant move in a permanent capital play until we see how that plays out.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Fair enough, folks. Second question is in regards to the electric transmission side. Clearly, there are some very large projects still out there, as you mentioned. As revenues slow down because these projects are being delayed, can you still see backlog grow as some of these hit by the end of the year? Or does it seem like on the electric T&D side, we are now looking at maybe backlog investing flattish?","James F. O'Neil","I think that you can have quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in backlog, Tahira. But it should remain strong and even grow, if we get some pent-up backlog because we can't get through the construction delay. Because of construction delays typically projects aren't awarded until they get the permitting cleared and the projects moved to construction. So delays in backlog in revenues kind of work hand in hand with one another. But I do think that certainly, the multi-year outlook is really -- is strong. What's happening is we're getting a lot of -- our work is starting to move toward the Northeast U.S. and into Eastern Canada. That's where you typically have harder -- our customers have more difficult times permitting lines, primarily because of the customer population and density, but we do think that we'll break through here as we move into '16. And there are other opportunities in the Southeast U.S. and the Western U.S., particularly to deal with the intermittency of renewables, where permitting has historically been easier in the western states. So we see a lot of opportunity out there for growth. How backlog plays out: It should remain strong and grow over a multi-year period.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Now that we're a little bit further into the oil downturn, gentlemen, what do you -- you guys have $1 billion shale business on the pipe side. And then I assume you're doing some electrification in the shales of -- in your power segment. I mean, what are you seeing in the shales right now?","James F. O'Neil","I think on the last call, I said that the low price of oil would affect us about 5% of our total business. It's probably a little bit more than that right now. Fortunately, we weren't really concentrated in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, where those oil-rich sands and those areas have been impacted from the wellhead to the midstream gathering programs. Those are down. The Marcellus, we're still active there. We have seen a little bit of slowdown but that's primarily because of the inability to get permitting for the main pipelines to take product out of there, not the low price of oil. But overall, the gathering work we anticipate will still run about the same revenue -- at the same revenue level as we -- have been experiencing over the last several years. And if it did fall off, we certainly believe that any fall off in the oil and gas sector, whether it's a downturn in gathering or services impacted by the low price of oil will be offset by mainline additions that we expect here, not only this year, but over the next several years.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","That's my follow-up question on the mainline additions. Why would Columbia be -- award this job now for something that starts in 2017?","James F. O'Neil","Well, because customers are concerned about capacity. And to our comments over the last several quarters, there are some customers that are trying to plan their -- plan out their construction strategy earlier in the game. So you are going to see some awards, I believe, over the next several quarters that will have some time in between the contract award and when the project's start date is. And a lot of that is being driven by these projects are very large in size and scope. They need to be planned early. And they need to have a certainty that the construction resources will be available to do the work.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Noelle Dilts with Stifel.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","For my first question, I just wanted to dig into the free cash flow profile of the business a little bit. First, just on the kind of core business, given that you're expecting somewhat lower growth in transmission this year, how are you thinking about working capital investment? Do you think it's still going to be an investment this year? Or that it could be a source of cash? And then, also am I thinking about this correctly, with the fiber optic licensing sale, that it should actually be free cash flow, accretive, given that you're losing some net income but obviously, you've been investing heavily in CapEx for that business? So overall, you could actually see a bit of the benefit.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, as it relates to the kind of global free cash flow, I've made comments last year that I thought 2015 might have the opportunity to have overall stronger free cash flow. We're seeing that here in the first quarter to the extent that there is a little bit of a flatness in revenues that generally offers opportunity for a stronger bit of free cash flow. But right now, I'm still looking at my DSOs to still run probably in the 80-day range throughout the year, so that will create that kind of a regular pace. And to the extent that mainline opportunities come about, mainline is actually where I see a bigger need for working capital and some of the demand. So I think that will offset some of that creation of cash that might happen on the electric power side. Most specifically, we think that we'll see -- continue to see those jobs ramp up throughout the rest of the year, which will continue to draw on working capital. On the fiber side, yes, what I would say is we have historically invested CapEx about equal to the cash flow that, that segment created. So net-net, we were about a 0 dollar free cash flow for fiber. So once you take that out, at least as ratio perspective, it seems to improve the ratio.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Second, just given that you have these funds coming in, can you just expand a little bit on your appetite for acquisitions? You've been making a lot of smaller bolt-on acquisitions, would that -- is that what you continue to plan to do? Or would you look to maybe make some larger acquisitions? And then, you talked about wanting to increase your presence in the energy space. Would this be kind of continuing to look in electric and pipeline? Or do you think you might look to maybe just a tangential energy market?","James F. O'Neil","Noelle, this is Jim. I think we're going to continue to be opportunistic on acquisitions. I don't think -- our strategy has not changed. I do believe that we will see the same number of acquisitions that we've, as far as the number that we've transacted on, will be comparable to the last several years. The dollar value will probably be a little bit lower. So the total consideration we pay for acquisitions in '15 will probably be less than what we did in '13 and '14. I don't see any big acquisition out there. And I think that's probably the concern of investors that we're going to take this money go make a big play in M&A, and we don't see that right now. I think we're going to continue to be very selective and continue to follow the same strategy that we've embarked on the last several years.","Derrick A. Jensen","One bit additional color to that is that of those acquisitions, you might see the cash-stock mix switch a little bit. As you've seen throughout the first quarter and second quarter, actually most transactions, if not all, have effectively been all cash transactions. The size of those transactions dictate a little bit of that, such that you might see us using a little bit more cash because of those smaller-sized deals.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just 2 questions. One, in your prepared remarks, Jim, I think you mentioned some delays on certain transmission projects related to your usual regulatory stuff. I was just hoping you could provide some color in terms of the total size of the projects, how many they are? Is there anything similar about those projects, which are causing sort of the regulatory issues? Or is it just more of the same? And sort of could you quantify what your impact is in terms of earnings for '15? And does that roll into '16? And then, my second question, just again on the -- the decision to sell. You, obviously, got a really good multiple: The 15x. That's interesting. But is there -- should I read anything, Jim or Derrick, into the timing? I mean, you obviously got a very good multiple. And we can also argue that the multiples for the businesses that you're in are probably fairly depressed, given the market short-term view on sort of energy? So are you trying to be, I guess, opportunistic here just because these multiples are depressed for the potential acquisitions you're looking at?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, first on your question on transmission projects, I think it's pervasive throughout both larger projects and also projects we're doing under MSAs to where it's just more difficult to cite any infrastructure. The larger projects I do want to reiterate, they're not canceled. They just get pushed out. It's very difficult to sight and permit some of these larger lines, and we do see delays of up to years here. We were in some of the final stages of permitting and sighting. We thought projects would move forward by the end of this year, but they slipped into '16. And again, the smaller MSA-type transmission projects, we also see some issues there, especially in areas that have a population concentration. It's just difficult to even site projects that are just a mile or 2 long if this transmission and not reconductoring of any existing right-of-ways. As far as Sunesys, there was no rhyme or reason to why, there was no -- we didn't sell Sunesys because the M&A multiples were down in the Oil and Gas sector. This is something that we've been contemplating primarily for several different reasons, but the fiber market has continued to accelerate. The competitive environment has continued to change. There's been a lot of mergers, acquisitions, private equities involved, very -- a lot of aggressiveness by competition to penetrate Sunesys' footprint. We don't have the capital to compete in that environment today. I mean, that business has changed significantly over the last 5 years in a good way. We've done our best to create, and we have created value for our investors but we think that at the rate that the market is accelerating, we felt that we could lose our competitive advantage because we didn't have the capital to compete. I mean, you're seeing hundreds of millions of dollars deployed by customers -- or by competitors into this space. And it does -- that business takes a lot of cash to compete, and that's not who we are. We're an energy infrastructure company and we had to pick our priority. And our priority is certainly to build out opportunities in the energy infrastructure space, and that's where our capital is going to go. So it's just the best decision for the employees of Sunesys and it's the best decision for our shareholders and it did happen at a very opportune time, I think, in the industry. In our industry, both from on the energy side and on the fiber side for Crown Castle.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dan Mannes with Avondale Partners.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","So another follow-up on the electric side, Jim. So just so I understand, this sounds like an evolution from maybe the fourth quarter as to incremental delays. When you think about your guidance for this year, your second half guidance doesn't look like it was materially changed. So is this essentially a bet that you're going to get sufficient pipeline to backfill? Or is that pipeline on the mainline side that you already have that's going to backfill for these delays?","James F. O'Neil","No, we've got -- at the midpoint of our guidance, we have, in hand, the mainline work this year. So if there aren't any delays, I mean, these are projects that are permitted or ready to go, that some of them are even on construction now. We would, on the higher end of our guidance, would require some new awards, which is a possibility in the fourth quarter of this year because we do see things on the mainline side beginning to accelerate. But we would require some uncommitted mainline to get to the top end of our guidance. I think on the electric side, I mean, transmission, we're not -- we have not peaked, but we've -- we have taken a pause. And that's going to happen. I mean, we've had significant growth in transmission over the last several years. Some of these delays -- we are pausing. I mean, we're still going to generate revenues at a high level, consistent with where we've been here over the last several quarters, but we're not going to see a fall off. But I think our growth -- any falloff can be -- will be replaced or augmented by mainline pipe on a consolidated basis.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then real quick, as it relates to the fiber business, obviously, you have pretty attractive takeout multiple. But just wondering, as you thought through this process, were there other opportunities to do this, i.e. was there consideration of spin-off? Was this an auction? Or was this just a bilateral negotiation with you and Crown Castle? If you could just give a little bit more color on the decision-making?","James F. O'Neil","Well, we've had a great working relationship with Crown Castle over the last several years. They've licensed our fiber for their small-cell deployment. And it just evolved into a discussion from working together as strategic partners to try to deploy their small-cell. And it moved into a situation where we did consider other options at the time, very hard. We did bring in JPMorgan from the standpoint of helping us work through those decisions. They've done more fiber deals than anybody in this space. We felt that the offer that we received from Crown Castle was very attractive compared to historical multiples that have been paid in this business. And so we felt that it was in the best interest to move forward with them to see if we can strike a deal. One of the main reasons we did that is I didn't need disruption of the Sunesys' workforce. And very public processes can create a negative impact on operations. So it just worked out really well. I think it was the cleanest way to do a deal. We got outside advisers. We did consider options, but the multiple that they were offering us in the process was, I think, the most efficient way and the quickest way to get to an SBA.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'm wondering if you can just give us a sense for the oil and gas booking activity that's going on in Canada, both on the smaller side and at Banister. What kind of work is being booked there right now? And how are you managing the resources there, given the uncertainty of some of the bigger projects?","James F. O'Neil","I think Canada is a very robust environment. It's -- Banister is the #1 player in that market in Canada in mainline. We have seen some delays here in '15 in some of Banister's. The opportunities that we expected in '15 did get pushed, but I would say that our robustness and the outlook is for Banister is more than what we anticipated when we bought them. And certainly, I think that mainline opportunities are going to play out for them in a big way as we move into '16 and beyond because they are the #1 player in Canada, and they have significant customer relationships with pipeline companies in Canada. So the Banister acquisition was very strategic for us. And while '15 will be a little bit soft for them, we're going to see some nice opportunities in the outer years with Banister leading those mainline pipe efforts.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. On the electric side, I think you mentioned the power plant that was not performing to expectations. Can you just give a little more color there? Remind us of how big that project is? What's going wrong? How far along it is and how confident are you that there won't be any kind of further negative issues there?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, the main problem there was material delays. I mean, we were on schedule. We're not really having performance issues. It's about a $200 million job. I believe we're 50% complete on it. We had some material delays on critical components that -- from manufacturing that created some issues. So we had to take some hits on that projects in the first quarter, but we believe things are heading in the right direction now there. But it was worthy of pointing out because it did have an impact on the quarter.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Alex Rygiel with FBR Capital Markets.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","To follow up on the last question, has the challenge with the power plant project changed your view on power generation at all?","James F. O'Neil","We've always said that we were going to be very selective in power generation. This is not an area that we see as a growth platforms per se but an area that we're going to be opportunistic on the smaller combined cycle plants. It's unfortunate that we have this issue here, but we do see opportunities to capitalize in some specialized areas on power plants going forward but this isn't a third leg of a stool or growth platform for us. It's more like renewables, that we have the expertise in-house to execute at a certain level on these projects. And we'll continue to be opportunistic when we can. Unfortunately, we've just had some issues on this 1 job, but I think there's opportunities going forward to take advantage of in this market at times.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Derrick, and I may have missed this. What was the foreign currency impact on backlog for both 12 months and total backlog?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, from a foreign currency perspective quarter-over-quarter, I'd call it, roughly 3%. It's about $140 million in electric power, I think, I called out for backlog, and that's 12 -- that's sequential backlog.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Rogers with D.A. Davidson.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Jim, just following up on comments about some of the deferrals and delays on the power side and also on the pipeline side, that you're seeing owners try and line up projects earlier. What are you seeing in the pricing market? I mean, that would suggest that there is excess capacity in the electrical side and capacity's tight on the pipeline side.","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean, some customers are traditionally bidding out projects as they've done in the past. Many have moved to a negotiated type stance to whether they're negotiating solely with 1 contractor, or 2 contractors on bigger programs. We're seeing a trend in that direction. I would say on the bidding, you're always going to have competition and you're going to always have to people that are being irrational and we're going to use our same bidding discipline that we've employed over the last several years. So our margins that we're bidding are no different than the margins that we've bid on in the past. But we are, on a positive note, seeing many customers again with these big capital programs that are moving toward a negotiating -- negotiated stance while -- exclusively with contractors. But margins in backlog right now are consistent with what we've historically generated over the last year or so.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And how far away are we from an improvement -- I mean, margins in the pipeline business that are double digits on an annual basis, that several years away still?","James F. O'Neil","Yes. I mean, I think margins in that segment are directly correlated to executing on mainline pipe projects and having a healthy amount of mainline revenue. And I think that's imminent. I mean, I think that as we get into '16, we should be in that 9% to 12% range if the mainline pipe programs play out as we expect. So I know people have been waiting for this for quite some time. We've been speaking about it for a couple of years. It's probably slipped about 9 months to a year from when I thought it was going to happen. Instead of being a '15 dynamic, though, I really think '16, certainly. We're starting to really get some visibility now that gives us some confidence that mainline pipe in '16 is going to happen.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe Derrick, for you, just some these numbers you gave, but just on the acquisitions that were completed in the quarter. Can you give us the backlog, the annualized revenue and maybe the aggregate capital deployed? The backlog and the annualized revenue by segment? Just to have -- give us a sense about how those things might be filtering in over the next year.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, I assume you're talking about the ones that were closed here in the second quarter. There's a couple of small deals. I'd say run rate revenue is probably in the $25 million to $35 million range in electric power. And backlog, call it, probably about $35 million, $40 million.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Nothing on the pipeline side?","Derrick A. Jensen","No, not for the deals closed in the second quarter they were both electric power.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got you. And on the big 2017 gas pipeline, that didn't go in backlog yet, did it? Or will it be in the second quarter of '15 backlog?","Derrick A. Jensen","No, it's not in backlog as of 3\/31.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from William Bremer with Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Many of my questions have been asked and answered. Have there been many change orders in either of the segments at this time?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, I mean, change orders are a regular part of our business, both approved and unapproved change-orders. That's an ongoing part of our business. I'd say there's no one quarter per se that stands out more than another in that regard. I did comment, as it relates to the specific activity we called out for -- here in the first quarter that we have not booked anything unique to that activity. So to the extent that are able to go through and do anything from a quantification perspective, that could lead to some potential upside in future quarters. But as it stands for those projects, we have not recorded any change orders.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay, Derrick. And another question focused on the oil and gas arena, primarily on the margins there this first quarter. Any one particular project that had an impact on margins? Or was it really just many of them in the weather areas that you voiced earlier?","Derrick A. Jensen","No, I mean, there wasn't any particular project performance that stands out really to cause an individual fluctuation per se on oil and gas. The margins for the first quarter, once you take out the arbitration cost for last year, are very comparable quarter-over-quarter and reflects, in our mind, a fairly normal seasonality. We would expect that there would be a little bit of pressure in the oil and gas margins in the fourth -- first quarter and then continue to grow throughout the year, much like we saw in last year. So as we go out further, I think you'll see us back into that 9% to 12% range overall. But I would still always anticipate that the first quarter have some degree of challenge just because of the normal seasonality.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Shlisky with Global Hunter Securities.","Michael Shlisky - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","So in the quarter, your corporate costs were up 11%, but your revenues were only up 7%. Are there any sort of onetime items in the quarter that are kind of worth pointing out? And what's the appropriate corporate cost rate going forward?","Derrick A. Jensen","There was -- there weren't anything particular to call out. I mean, we've got just kind of normal conversation adjustments, primarily associated with cost of living as well as that you have the full year effect or starting to get full effect, new employees that were hired last year. A lot of that having to deal with a lot of the greenfield and strategic initiatives that we have going on and bringing on personnel to support those initiatives. So that's why you'll see a little bit of G&A front running some portion of revenue in that. As far as guidance, overall, I think I'd say that corporate unallocated will continue to run somewhere in the 2.5% to 2.9% range; fairly consistent with what you saw in 2014.","Michael Shlisky - Global Hunter Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then secondly, on Australia, can you maybe update us on kind of what's been going on there? And do you have any plans to accelerate or decelerate your investment there given all the cash coming in and the FX rates?","James F. O'Neil","We still look at Australia as a great opportunity for us to expand the Quanta footprint. They had a great year last year. Probably won't see growth there because of the economy and the price of oil, but don't see any big fall-off there either. Coal seam gas projects are moving forward, but many of our customers in coal seam gas also have some oil interests. So they've been hit there on their other investments and their cash flows are down. So their pace of investment in the coal seam gas development has slowed somewhat. But with that said, there's opportunities to take advantage of in the electric space as well, and we continue to look at opportunities to grow there. There's just so many market drivers there that, with the deregulation that's occurring there, the aging infrastructure, renewable interconnections, there's a lot of opportunity to expand our electric and to maintain and grow our pipeline segment as well, as the opportunity exists. So I would say that we're going to just be calculated and our investments in Australia and slowly and opportunistically grow that platform. But there won't be any big play in Australia because of the Sunesys transaction.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Maybe talk about the expectations for the Electric Power segment margin in the long term? Do you think, given the changes in the backlog and product delays, that your expectations for the longer term outlook on the margins front have changed?","Derrick A. Jensen","No. I mean, we would still say that overall, we see electric power margins being able to be within the 10% to 12% range long term. This year, we still see the opportunity, for the latter half of the year, for our margins to be in that 10% to 12% range once we get past some degree of the seasonality that we're having here in the first and second quarter. And so with that, I mean, we are -- as Jim commented earlier, the margins on our backlog are very comparable to what we've seen over the last several years as far as -- from an execution and expectation standpoint. So I think that we'll see clearly opportunity for 10% to 12% margins in the Electric Power on a go-forward basis.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just on the mainline work, I mean, I must have missed this question, if you were already asked. But are you seeing any impact at all on the pricing environment and the margins that you expect from that segment especially? And how should we think about, again, the back half of the year, given the mix of your expectations or given the mix of mainline work? Do you see that margins in the back half of -- will be much better than the first few quarters?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, I would say it's very similar to electric power. Our normal seasonality is that as you look through the years, the second, third and fourth quarters have a tendency to have both expansion in revenue and somewhat an expansion in margin throughout. So to that end, I think that we'll see higher margin opportunities in the Oil and Gas segment for the third and fourth quarter. And your first part of that, which is speaking to mainline, I mean, we continue to see that also that margins are very capable of getting us back into the 9% to 12% range and executing at that level. And over the long term, we very much see that those mainline contributions will be pushing us -- pushing the segment to that type of level of performance.","James F. O'Neil","Yes, and I want to reiterate, our bidding discipline has not changed on mainline as well. And we continue to see additional opportunities come in, employing that discipline. So as Derrick stated, once we get into next year and we have a significant level of mainline pipe, we should be able to get within the range that we expect in that 9% to 12% range.","Operator","And this concludes the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","James F. O'Neil","Well, I'd like to thank all of you for participating on our first quarter 2015 conference call. We do appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services.

Duke?","Duke Austin","Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic commentary before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our first quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","Quanta's first quarter results were consistent with our expectations and put us on track to achieve our full year outlook. Our end markets are strengthening and we continue to believe we are entering a renewed multiyear up-cycle for our business. The successful execution of our strategic imperatives, coupled with favorable end-market trends, positions us well to further separate Quanta in the marketplace and for profitable growth.","Fundamental to Quanta's growth is our view that our backlog will remain strong and has a potential for solid growth. Our electric power segment backlog increased without the inclusion of multiple larger project opportunities that are in various stages of regulatory review or that remain subject to competitive submission processes to meet state and provincial energy policies.","Oil and gas segment backlog declined in the quarter, primarily due to burn associated with significant pipeline construction activity, seasonality and the cancellation of a pipeline project contract for which we received a cancellation fee. As a reminder, oil and gas segment backlog can be variable due to its faster book-and-burn nature and the timing of larger pipeline project awards.","As we mentioned in our Investor Day a month ago, we feel incrementally better about opportunities to book pipeline work for the second half of this year, which should positively impact backlog as contracts are executed. We're in the late-stage negotiations on multiple larger pipeline projects that are expected to start construction in 2017 and are in discussions for billions of dollars of larger pipeline projects that could break ground over the next several years.","Overall, we are supporting our customers' project scoping and infrastructure development initiatives across our segments and believe there is opportunity for our backlog to increase to record levels over the next several quarters.","Turning to the electric power segment, Labrador Island Link transmission project for Nalcor Energy in Canada is progressing well. In addition, full scale construction on the Fort McMurray West 500 kilovolt transmission project is on track to begin in the third quarter of this year. We have completed many important engineering and procurement milestones over the past two years for this EPC project and now look forward to the construction phase.","The Fort McMurray West project is the largest individual project ever awarded to Quanta. Based on this expected timing, the Fort McMurray project should ramp up as the Nalcor project moves to completion. This dynamic should provide an efficient transition of our people and equipment, improve the stability for our Canadian operations and provide multiyear visibility since the project is scheduled to complete in 2019. Though our Canadian operations remain challenged by economic conditions, we are proud of how our team has executed on the Nalcor project.","Overall, our customers' multiyear capital budgets continue to increase and should remain robust for some time. We continue to believe larger transmission project awards will likely increase over the next 18 months. We are in various levels of active discussion with numerous utilities and merchant transmission companies in North America about their transmission projects.","Several of these projects are making progress with permitting and regulatory approvals, which increases our confidence that they could break ground over the near to medium term. In addition, small and medium transmission projects, as well as distribution work, remain active, and large multiyear MSA proposal activity is at record levels.","Further, we believe the deployment of several new large multiyear capital programs by our customers is imminent. These programs include both larger and smaller electric power infrastructure projects to upgrade and enhance the grid. We are able to provide comprehensive turnkey solutions for these multiyear capital programs that we believe are unmatched in the industry. As we have said in the past, we believe we are uniquely well positioned to provide solutions for these potential opportunities, which are of the size and scope our industry has rarely experienced.","We continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our electric power segment and believe we are entering an upward multiyear cycle. The end-market drivers we have spoken about for some time continues to spur demand for Electric Power Infrastructure Services. These drivers, including the need to maintain and replace aging infrastructure, generation mix shifting to more renewables and natural gas, grid modernization and regulation aimed at improving grid reliability are what we believe will continue to provide opportunities to grow are our electric business.","Turning to our oil and gas segment, we generated record revenues in the quarter, which is also noteworthy because it occurred when it's typically the lowest quarter of the year due to seasonality. The quarter's record revenues were primarily driven by strong activity on several larger pipeline projects in the Southern United States and in Canada, which contribute to significant margin improvements versus the same quarter last year. We did, however, experienced some margin pressure in our base business.","For example, we have been increasing and training our workforce to meet our customers' needs for the multiyear gas distribution and integrity programs. However, a couple of these customers delayed commencement of work under our MSAs during the quarter, which impacted margins. As discussed earlier in my remarks, we believe the larger pipeline project market will remain active for several years and are pleased with our execution to date.","In addition to larger projects, we see opportunity for base load work to continue to grow over the coming years. This base load work includes supporting midstream infrastructure, downstream support services, natural gas distribution, pipeline integrity, MSAs, pipeline logistics management, horizontal directional drilling and engineering.","During the first quarter, we resolved the litigation initiated by Dycom Industries related to the non-compete agreement entered into in connection with Quanta's disposition of certain communication construction operations to Dycom in December of 2012. While the terms of the resolution are confidential, we are very pleased with the outcome.","We began the expansion of our U.S. communications infrastructure services operations following the expiration of our prior non-compete agreement in early December 2016, and with this litigation now behind us, our ability to continue our U.S. expansion efforts is unencumbered. Our U.S. market expansion efforts have been very well received by our current and potential customers, and we are actively pursuing opportunities with various U.S. telecom and cable MSOs.","We have developed a workforce and delivery model over the past several months and anticipate receiving awards in the second quarter. Outside of the U.S., we signed several MSAs in Canada. During the first quarter, deployed fiber to eight communities throughout the country, and our Latin American operation continues to expand its fiber, wireless and cable operations, which are all performing well.","Quanta has provided infrastructure services to the communications industry since the company's inception and the expansion of our U.S. operations complements our existing and growing operations in Canada and Latin America. All three of these geographies provide multifaceted opportunities for growth in a broad diversified customer base, which we believe is advantageous versus focusing on just one area.","We're excited about the market opportunity and look forward to sharing our progress and success as we grow our communications infrastructure services operations. We also continue to advance our infrastructure solutions capabilities with strategic partnerships between Quanta, our customers and capital partners. These typically take the form of concessions, public-private partnerships or private infrastructure projects in the markets served by Quanta. These structures are fairly common arrangements in the infrastructure world and Quanta has good success with partnerships like these over the recent years.","Quanta believes aligning is a true partner in these projects, and for select projects investing alongside our customers, creates a strong collaborative relationship that is open and transparent. We believe this approach yields greater opportunity for Quanta and our customers to drive a more efficient and effective design and overall structure that reduces cost and increases the chances the project moves forward and is executed successfully.","Infrastructure solutions is a capability that we've been building and executing on for a number of years. These successful efforts have resulted in approximately $2 billion of project revenue across our core competencies in electric power, oil and gas and telecom and across our geographies in Canada, the U.S. and Latin America. Further, we are pursuing a number of additional projects that fit well with our infrastructure solutions capabilities.","During the quarter, we enhanced our capabilities with the establishment of First Infrastructure Capital, or FIC, which is a partnership between Quanta and select infrastructure investors. FIC provided $750 million of available capital to invest in infrastructure projects with the potential for this additional capital from our existing FIC partners. This partnership is an important part of our broader strategy of partnering with our customers and providing fully integrated, differentiated infrastructure solutions while leveraging Quanta's operational excellence, strong execution capabilities and project finance expertise.","In summary, the year started off well and we are on target to achieve our full expectations. While project permitting and regulatory challenges remain, we continue to have a positive multiyear view of the end markets we serve and believe we are entering a new - renewed multiyear up-cycle for our electric power, oil and gas and communications infrastructure service capabilities. We are confident that Quanta is well positioned to provide unique solutions to our customers and capitalize on favorable end-market trends.","We are focused on operating the business for the long term and continuing to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset will continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for our stakeholders.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our first quarter results. Derrick?","Derrick Jensen","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $2.18 billion for the first quarter of 2017, reflecting a 27.1% increase from the first quarter of 2016.","Net income attributable to common stock was $48.3 million or $0.31 per diluted share compared to net income attributable to common stock of $20.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2016.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.39 for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $0.23 for the first quarter of 2016.","The increase in consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2017, as compared with first quarter of last year, was primarily associated with increased capital spending by our oil and gas pipeline customers on larger projects, certain of which moved into full construction during the second half of 2016 and continued into 2017.","Our consolidated gross margin was 12.2% as compared to 11.9% in the first quarter 2016. This increase was driven by improved margins in both segments, which I'll discuss later in my prepared remarks.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were $184.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 or 8.5% of revenues as compared to $158.5 million or 9.3% of revenues in last year's first quarter. The increase in G&A was primarily due to higher compensation costs largely associated with higher incentive compensation based on current level of profitability as well as annual compensation increases and increased personnel to support business growth.","Other increases include a $1.9 million loss on a planned sale of a construction barge, approximately $1 million in incremental administrative costs associated with acquired companies and costs associated with ongoing technology and business development initiatives.","Higher quarter-over-quarter legal costs, inclusive of the attorney's fees and expenses of $4.2 million attributable to the non-compete matter, largely offset the decline in G&A associated with severance and restructuring costs recognized in the first quarter of 2016.","To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues increased 2.7% to $1.22 billion when compared to last year's first quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher customer spending associated with larger transmission projects, $18.7 million in additional emergency restoration services revenues and approximately $10 million in revenues from acquired companies.","Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in the power plant related revenues due primarily to a lower volume of renewable power projects ongoing in the first quarter of 2017, and to a lesser extent, to the completion of a power plant project in Alaska during 2016. Operating margin in the electric power segment increased to 8.2% in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to 7.4% in last year's first quarter.","Operating margin improved primarily as a result of $21.3 million of project losses related to the power plant project in Alaska that were recognized in the first quarter of 2016 as well as the incremental emergency restoration services in 1Q '17, I spoke of earlier, which typically yield higher margins.","Partially offsetting these increases were slightly lower margins related to a large Canadian transmission project that, although progressing well, continues to hold contingencies in order to address performance risks associated with the remaining challenging project conditions as well as variations due to typical seasonality and the timing of starts and stops of projects.","As of March 31, 2017, 12-month backlog for the electric power segment was $3.6 billion, which is an increase of 6% when compared to December 31, 2016, and total backlog for the segment was $6.8 billion, reflecting a 1.5% increase since year-end. As compared to the first quarter of 2016, total backlog for the segment increased 5.6%.","Oil and gas segment revenues increased 82% quarter-over-quarter to $958.7 million in 1Q '17. This increase was primarily due to increased capital spending by our customers on larger pipeline transmission projects. The increase in revenues from larger pipeline projects also drove the operating margin to 4% in 1Q '17 from 1.1% in 1Q '16 as these larger projects typically have a higher margin profile due to the associated risks.","Additionally, the overall higher revenues in the segment allow for better coverage of fixed and overhead costs. We executed within the segment largely, as expected. Margins were positively impacted by the termination fee that Duke mentioned related to a project cancellation during the quarter.","However, this was offset by specific negative impacts due to adverse weather conditions on certain projects as well as lower margins from two distribution MSAs associated with unexpected delays in the release of work although crews had already been mobilized.","As of March 31, 2017, 12 month backlog for the oil and gas segment was $1.9 billion and total backlog for the segment was $2.5 million, both representing a decrease compared to December 31, 2016.","These decreases are primarily due to burn of larger pipeline projects that moved into full construction, and to a lesser extent, the first quarter project cancellation. As Duke commented in his prepared remarks, we have been in active discussions on a number of pipeline projects, which gives us confidence in future backlog materializing.","Corporate and nonallocated costs increased $7.5 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to 1Q '16, due to $3.5 million of additional compensation costs and $1.8 million of increased costs associated with ongoing technology initiatives. Again, the higher legal fees this quarter were partially offset by lower severance costs as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016.","For the first quarter of 2017, cash flows used by operating activities of continuing operations were approximately $3.8 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $42.2 million, resulting in $46 million of negative free cash flow.","This compares to free cash flow of $163.2 million for the first quarter of 2016. Free cash flow for the quarter was negatively impacted by higher working capital requirements associated with the significant increase in the number and size of oil and gas infrastructure projects that moved into full construction as compared to last year's first quarter.","In addition, the timing of revenues in 1Q '17 were more heavily weighted towards the last month of the quarter, partly due to emergency restoration work performed in March. These negative impacts to free cash flow during the quarter are partially offset by the positive impact of improved operating results.","Additionally, the invoicing challenges and billing delays on two electric transmission projects in remote regions of Northeastern Canada, which we have discussed in previous calls, continue to negatively affect cash flow. The overall AR and unbilled position for these projects remains comparable to the fourth quarter 2016 due to current quarter collections being offset by the recognition of additional revenues.","The various receivables, change orders, and to a lesser extent, claims associated with the customer's scope changes as well as access and delay items continue to be processed by both parties. We continue to work collaboratively with the customer and have numerous meetings scheduled throughout the upcoming months as the job nears completion.","Despite the larger balances related to these invoicing challenges and billing delays, DSOs remained relatively consistent with 78 days at March 31, 2017, compared to 74 days at December 31, 2016, and 76 days at the end of last year's first quarter. At March 31, 2017, with $106.5 million in cash, we had $323.2 million in letters of credit outstanding and had $417.7 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with $1.18 billion in total liquidity as of March 31, 2017.","Turning to our guidance, with the strong revenues in the first quarter, we are increasing our full year 2017 revenue expectations to range between $8.1 billion and $8.6 billion. Our range of guidance contemplates that at the low to midrange, revenues in the second and third quarters could be comparable to the first quarter or could be lower due to potential project delays or even cancellations, while at the high end, we could see slight sequential growth from the first through the third quarter.","In any case, we would still continue to expect a revenue decline in the fourth quarter as compared to 2016, primarily due to the timing of larger pipeline projects. Based on this increased revenue expectation, at the high end, we could see revenue growth slightly exceeding 10% in both segments. Shortly after this conference call, we will post a summary of our guidance expectations in the Investors & Media section of our website.","We continue to anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year to be between $1.52 and $1.77 and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $1.82 and $2.07. Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share presented in our release.","Our annual 2017 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange rate environment. Fluctuations of foreign exchange rates could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and could cause actual financial results to differ from guidance. We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, which positions the company for continued growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with the focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital, capital expenditures and organic growth.","We continue to see acquisitions as a fundamental component of our strategy, and with the formation of First Infrastructure Capital, we also see continued, if not incremental, opportunities for investments supporting our customers and the development of incremental backlog for Quanta. Although we take an opportunistic approach to these two components of our capital allocation, we believe that these opportunities could require significant uses of capital.","This concludes our formal presentation and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Noelle Dilts of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Noelle Dilts","Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to start on your pipeline backlog. So it sounds like you guys are pretty confident on the outlook there and the opportunity around some large projects in spite of backlog being down in the quarter. So the first question is, are you in sort of very advanced discussions on some of these jobs and you're just waiting for formal approvals to come through? Or is that just they're going to get awarded down the line? And then the second question there is, how much did the project cancellation impact backlog? And then if you could just discuss sort of what happened there and how often you see these types of cancellations that would be helpful.","Duke Austin","Yes, Noelle, this is Duke. As far as the backlog goes, and where we're at in the pipeline cycle there, it's lumpy, we've talked about it. We've announced ACP before. It's not in our backlog today. So you can see some of the stuff that's not in there and others that are imminent here. So it's - we're just in late stages of negotiations. It doesn't meet the criteria to put in our backlog. We feel confident that we'll fill that up with our large pipeline business. The 2018 cycle is robust. The latter half of 2017 is looking favorable. So we're happy with where we're at on that. As far as the cancellation fee, there are some contracts that contemplate this and delays and this is one of them. Roughly, the amount was around $100 million so for 2017.","Noelle Dilts","Okay. Great. And then could you give us an update on your utilization in terms of your mainline spreads in the quarter? And if you had to make an estimate, how utilized is the industry today? And at your Investor Day, you talked about 2018 potentially being capacity constrained. Are you still thinking that's the right way to think about it?","Duke Austin","Sure. We're in a robust environment in our large pipeline business. Rover's moving along. I think we're in good shape in 2018 as well as we stated in the past that we do have capacity. We can still book work. But I feel confident that with the ongoing opportunities and what we see, we should be in pretty good shape here for the next few years.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning guys.","Duke Austin","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Duke, you mentioned at your Analyst Day that you're starting to see some signs of life in your Canadian oil and gas business. When do you think those signs of life can translate into results? I think you mentioned that Canada was overall, right now, a low single-digit margin business. From what you see right now, do you have enough visibility to say your margin in Canada can be higher than that later this year or even just in 2018?","Duke Austin","Yes, I think you have to look at it on the electric side and the gas side and split it. If you want to talk about Canada, the overall economics, being energy based, are down but our project-based business and the need to move natural gas to the coastline is there. We like where we're at. We like where we're positioned there. We're starting to see some projects move forward in your shales, in your Montney shales and such moving that gas out. And when you get some takeaway in there, things will look good. We've seen Trans Mountain get mentioned a few times. Those kind of things, those larger projects stroll up resources in the country and so that allows others - other projects that we'll be on to - we can execute well.","So I like where we're at there. I think we're cautious about the overall economy on the gas side, but there's signs of life. On the electric side, with us having a backbone project of WFMAC and coming off Nalcor, we are seeing some stuff in the East, Toronto and in the West. Alberta is still, besides WFMAC, it's still very depressed there. So we're optimistic on the coast and we're cautious about the Alberta market. But all in all, we're executing through it pretty well through a tough economy there. And if you go back a few years in Canada, it was our highest margins in our company. So I'm optimistic we'll come back to those margins over time.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. That's helpful, Duke. And Derrick, you raised guidance for the year by a couple of pennies. You talked about having increasing conviction in the fourth quarter. When I look at the revenue guidance raise and the $0.02 increase, it looks like the revenue guidance raise is on sort of low-ish low margin. Maybe you can talk about that. But do you feel more confident here in the fourth quarter, even with the oil and gas backlog down? So fourth quarter is not going to be that big trail off that you talked about last quarter as a concern?","Derrick Jensen","Yes, what I'd said is I still expect the fourth quarter to be a downtick, irrespective of where we see the overall uptick in revenues. Last quarter to - fourth quarter '16 versus fourth quarter '17, I still believe that we're looking at a downtick. The uptick in the revenues overall for our guidance, some of that came from the strong quarter in the first - the strong revenue in the first quarter, but otherwise, it comes from some level of incremental comfort as we spoke about before in the back half of the year. But that's coming from both electric power and oil and gas, probably somewhat equally at this stage. We see some opportunity in backlog for both. But I'd still think you need to be factoring in a downtick in the fourth quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Tahira Afzal","Hi Folks.","Duke Austin","Good morning.","Tahira Afzal","Duke, first question is really in regards to follow up on what Noelle was asking. You're pointing to a record backlog. And if you really do the math over the next quarter, it basically implies a pretty sizable opportunity on the bookings side. Should we - are any of those dependent on the FERC quorum at this point? Or is the timing of the bookings and the risk really not regulatory related at this point?","Duke Austin","Yes, as I've said with Noelle, I think what we see and our opportunity that we see and where we're at in the stages of the contract negotiations, we feel confident in the statement. So I'm fairly optimistic that we'll be in record backlogs.","Tahira Afzal","Got it. Okay, Duke. And the second question is on the telecom side. I know it's just a small part of your business right now but one that could potentially be growing pretty rapidly. Should we be looking for any visible announcement around MSAs from key customers to really help us feel comfortable around how you're doing there?","Duke Austin","I would say, Tahira, we'll over-communicate a bit for a few quarters here on telecom because we'll give you some idea of where we're at. I do think we're a little bit behind where I'd like to be. When you have a lawsuit in front of you, it does. It is a distraction on the operation and that past us now. And hopefully, that's the last time we'll talk about that, I think it is. And we're optimistic of the markets and you see it growing. You see what AT&T, Verizon and others are doing in that business. And our Canadian operations, our Latin America operations are growing nicely, similar to what you see others are doing in the U.S. So we had really good feedback from the customer base and I'm confident we'll move forward here in the next few quarters. And we'll definitely communicate it to the investment community.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Wittmann of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Andrew Wittmann","Great, thanks and good morning. I guess I wanted to start my questions on the Labrador Island contract. I heard a couple of things in the script but thought maybe could use a little bit more color. In particular, you mentioned that's - it's on track and it's going well but you are baking in some level of contingency. I want to understand that a little bit better. As you finish up here later this year, do you expect, because your booking it more conservatively here, that if things progress at the existing pace, that you'll be able to book an incentive award or some sort of third quarter benefit when that thing completes? But I also heard that, obviously, the receivables have been slow to come in and that there's potential for claims on that. So I was hoping you could give us some sense about the magnitude of the claims that you're contesting and the impact that might be having on the receivables as well.","Duke Austin","Yes, I'll talk a little bit about the job itself and let Derrick talk a little bit about the numbers. From our standpoint, we're working collaboratively with the client and I think both of us have the same goal in mind and that's for a completion and it be a successful project. There's nothing to read into that other than we're working together to - on both commercially and on schedule that they would like to see completed this year. So we're working through all the issues that it takes to do that. It is a 1,200 kilometer or so job across very remote country and you get 50 foot of snow in the winter and so things, you get a thaw. And so it's difficult from a construction standpoint and we've done a great job executing through it. I'm happy with our performance there. And so the client's happy with us and we'll get through the commercial issues here over the next few quarters. And I'll let Derrick comment on where we're at from a cash standpoint.","Derrick Jensen","Yes. Also, this relates to the contingencies. I mean, the contingencies are normal in any job like this. The job is a very large job, as Duke spoke about. And to that level, I mean, we're going to manage those contingencies relative to the risks that we see ahead of us. Is there the opportunity for some of those contingencies to come through with an expanded margin? I would say yes. It's typical to all of our type of work we think that if we can execute through contingencies it offers us a degree of upside. We have not factored that into the equation because it is still a complicated job.","As it relates to the receivables, as we've talked about in previous quarters, effectively, the new revenue for a given period is replacing the settlements of older balances. So we're just kind of turning the balances each individual quarter. The overall net position has stayed relatively constant over the last 6 to 9 quarters as the new work is replacing the old. And then as it relates to any aspect from a change order perspective, most of that is really just kind the unit adders in the contract itself and any of that is the smallest portion of the overall receivables, unbilled production and change orders. It's the smallest component of the equation.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay, that's helpful. My follow-up question was on the pipeline segment. And there, I just wanted to take your pulse a little bit on - from the various basins. I mean, you guys have been pretty clear over time that, out east in particular, some where you believe you are competitively advantaged. But the Permian has clearly been an active shale basin here with a bunch of work. Now I believe that's been largely a nonunion basin, but I was just wondering about your degree of confidence in participating in some of that work with your largely union precedent?","Duke Austin","Yes. Last year, we added some nonunion capabilities in addition to what we've had. All those projects were around the edges on all of them. And so we see them depending on where we're at from capacity and what they're trying to accomplish. We're in there. We're in all the basins for the most part. There's also some EPC opportunities with both pipe and stations in that arena that will be around. So we like it. We like it. It gets capacity out of the market as well. So again, as you start to see that takeaway come in, you'll start to see midstream business come back and all those markets are good markets for us.","Operator","The next question is from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. A couple of questions, one, Derrick, I don't think, in the prepared remarks, I heard you comment on the margin targets by segment for the year. So I just want to make sure that hasn't changed. And then I also want to understand sort of your revenue guidance at the low to the midrange. I think you said revenues will be comparable or down a little in - or comparable in Q2 and Q3 versus before, you were saying revenues should improve sequentially, just generally. So what changed that? And at the mid- to low end of the range, how do you hit your margin targets for the year if revenues aren't up? Because I always thought you said utilization in revenue ramp were one of the bigger drivers behind hitting your margin targets.","Derrick Jensen","Yes, our margin targets for the year still remain unchanged. You're looking at electric power probably in the low 9% to mid-9% and for oil and gas to be somewhere between the 5% and 6% range, which is comparable to what we said at year-end. Relative to revenues, before, we thought we would have a lower revenue number for the first quarter. Revenues for the first quarter came in pretty strong. So to that end, that's what's giving us the commentary around the potential for flat to lower at kind of the midpoint range or to low end of the range as it relates to the second and third quarter. There's still the ability to have the sequential increase in the second and third at the high end of the range. And so I think that commentary is consistent.","But we're trying to be prudent about the way the timing of work can go, whether it be between delays or cancellations. So that's why you're seeing our commentary at the midpoint to low end of the revenue saying that it could be flattish. And then overall, as far as whether that puts pressure on it, that's what we've tried to consider in the margin ranges, that the low end to the high end of revenue is driving kind of the low end to the high end of the overall margin ranges. So I think that's fairly consistent as far as what we think about absorption of costs. That's what we said at year-end.","Jamie Cook","Okay. And then just, I guess, two other follow-up questions. You said the cancellation in oil and gas, that was $100 million, right? But how big was the termination fee that hit the oil and gas segment? And then when I look at your electric power margins, while they improved on a GAAP basis, if you adjust the Alaska problem project in '17, your margins are actually down from 9.2% last year to 8.2% this year. So I'm just trying to understand that. Is that all just Canada? And then I'll get back in queue.","Derrick Jensen","Yes, Duke did comment that the cancellation for the project was around $100 million. As far as the fee, we're not in position to really quantify. We try not talk about the individual profitability of any individual contract. As it relates to the down margins, yes, you're correct, adding back the power plant last year would get you to something over 9% to something closer into the 8% range this quarter. But that was what was expected. We had commented about the seasonal effects that we could see and a lot of that coming out of Canada.","Canada had a - has normal kind of a volatile - it froze and it warmed up and all that stuff hasn't impacted the margins. We had incremental adverse weather across both Canada, U.S. and Latin America this quarter, so - but all of that was effectively baked into our previous expectations. Lastly, I mean, it's the ramp-up as we look at the later part. We've mobilized a lot of crews in order to set up for how we're going to be executing on some of the MSA work here in the second and third quarter. So a combination of factors but the margins overall this year were still coming into around our expectations.","Duke Austin","Yes. Jamie, I'd like to add a little bit of commentary on that. We got $6 billion or so to execute through the next three quarters, and obviously, the first quarter has got the most seasonality in it. We're through it, so we can see the visibility in the next three. As we execute through, we will update. Also, as Derrick said, we added roughly around 1,000 employees in the quarter. And as you do that it in your baseload business for the future, it's difficult to put the thing into three month windows. So as we have to talk about today, that's a good thing going forward. We're, by our highest headcount, 29,400. So we're optimistic about what's going on with the base business and also where we're going in the future. So it did put a little pressure on this three months here.","Operator","The next question is from Matt Duncan of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Matt Duncan","Hey, good morning guys. So in oil and gas, you talked about some of the things that impacted margins and I'm curious if you can maybe quantify how much the impact was in those items underutilization of some of your people that would be doing MSA work, the weather impact. What was sort of the total impact on margin? What could it have been without those problems?","Duke Austin","Yes, I don't - I'll let Derrick give you a quantification. I just - it's a general quantification to us. It's just we know it's pressure when we see 1,000 employees get at it. We know the Northeast. But we contemplate a lot of that in our guidance and so for us to say we didn't contemplate any of that would be a fallacy because we knew seasonality was there. We've stated it when we talked in our Investor Day that we thought that there would be some seasonality, we contemplated it. Yes, there were some impacts, both sides of this. But again, we contemplate the seasonality in the first quarter. But adding 1,000 employees and the seasonality is kind of what we're talking about.","Derrick Jensen","Yes, I don't know that I'm in a spot to specifically quantify the ups and downs. I would agree with Duke's commentary that, effectively, the margins came in very near what our original expectations were and so any of the ins and outs were effectively offsetting during the quarter.","Matt Duncan","Okay and then a couple of others. So on the revenue guide, Derrick, did I hear you correctly that there's the potential for both businesses to have 10% growth? I guess, is that kind of the high end of the guidance range if they could both be over 10%-plus? And along that vein, what level of second half revenue does the guidance contemplated in oil and gas? And how conservative are you still being with that outlook? I know you said you feel a little bit better about the prospects for the back half, so curious on that. And then last thing on the number side, just can you give us some thoughts around what the U.S. telecom reentry could add to revenue this year.","Duke Austin","Yes. From a revenue perspective, yes, at the high end, I would tell you at this stage, I mean, it's possible that - for both segments to slightly exceed 10% to get to the high end of the range. And then from a timing perspective and how that plays out, I think that we've still yet to see the risk profile as the back half of the year may still yet not materialize for oil and gas, which is what's giving the variability in the overall revenue profile with the back half still having the risk of having declines. Although we feel incrementally confident in the nature of the rewards, as it stands here, I mean, until we actually receive and place them in backlog.","We're not in position to guide to anything stronger and to continue to caution that the back half of the year could have weakness such as the fourth quarter. Much like we said at year-end, it could be down. And then the last part of your question, telecom, yes, as it stands here right now, we've not baked in any incremental aspects of telecom. We're still looking at something in the $150 million to $200 million range from both Canada, the U.S. and Latin America contributions. We have not increased anything relative to telecom.","Derrick Jensen","I think just as a general statement, to caution a bit, you still have a new administration. We needed FERC to get in place. We do think that that's going to happen but it does put pressure in some of the near-term things. So we need to be cautious of that in the back half of the year and how we look at it. And so that's - we're waiting on some of that to come through. You also still have some state permitting issues, especially the water permits in the Northeast. You see issues there at times. So we'll be cautious about how we look at that and when we give guidance. And so we think about that when we're putting the midpoint of the range here.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Fisher","Thanks, good morning. Since you put out there the thought about the opportunity to hit record backlog in the coming quarters, just, I don't know, timing is just still uncertain. But just trying to gauge your sense of what the chances of getting to that as soon as Q2, or is that sort of not even a possibility or it's more like a Q3, Q4, Q1 kind of thing for next year?","Duke Austin","No, I mean, I don't want to put a time frame on it. We're going to collaborate with our customers to get the right contracts in place for both risks and M&As. It takes time. They're big projects, obviously. So as you walk through those, it just takes time. So I don't want to put a time frame on it but I would say the next few quarters here.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And then in terms of the execution on some of the bigger projects, and I couldn't tell before is if when you're talking about 1,000 people added, if that was in - if that was the integrity work or if that was in the electric side but trying to get at the margins in the oil and gas side of the business. Is the execution on your larger projects, are they at a minimum hitting the as-bid margins? Because I know you had - you mentioned some weather-related delays. So just kind of curious, as we do expect to continue booking more of a larger project, how was the execution going on those projects?","Duke Austin","We're not complete with all of them. Many of them are in the late stages and we're happy with what we've done as far as executing on the broad spectrum of all of our pipe and our spreads. We're extremely satisfied with where we're at. We can always do better but we're happy. I think what puts pressure on our segment is that you have a lot of ancillary businesses with your MSA work, your integrity work, which is good and its good long-term work, but you do get seasonality. And when you are ramping for these long-term integrity programs, along with that seasonality puts pressure in any given quarter when you add those folks.","So lots of your adds are developed in this quarter or to support that piece of business and those guys once you get them trained. And also, we had some customers that delayed or were working through some state regulatory issues that cause some delays in MSAs that were anticipated to go in the first quarter. So that also caused a little pressure in the segment. We'll work through that as we go and start executing on their budgets for the year. Again, it's the right answer for the long term of the business, it just puts a little pressure here in the quarter. But we're happy with the way we executed on our mainline work.","Steven Fisher","And are they hitting the as-bid margins? Or was that the weather delay kind of keeping you below those or the weather issues?","Duke Austin","Well, we're not done with them yet, but we're happy with where we're at.","Operator","The next question is from Chad Dillard of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chad Dillard","Hi, good morning. Just a question on the FERC commission vacancies, this is probably more an industry question. So how are the approval delays for 2017 affecting the competitive dynamics on the pipeline contractor side? Is there a sense that 2017 work is getting pushed out to 2018? And if 2018 was already going to be a tight year, how - like would that suggest better pricing or terms for the contractors? How are you seeing this dynamic at play?","Duke Austin","From our standpoint, the way we looked at 2017 is playing out largely like we thought it would. As far as the way our customers look at it, they may look at it a little bit different than we did. But from our standpoint, the way that we see things happening is basically like we thought it would. What's going in '17 is going and with a few exceptions. Some of them did push a bit, but for the most part, it's playing out like we thought it would. We do need to get some commissioners in place. I don't think it's an issue. The administration has committed to putting people to work. I think you'll see that. The biggest issue that we see is probably in the Northeast with some of the water permits and some of the things that are going on there that you've seen make the press. All in all, it's lining up like we thought it would.","Chad Dillard","And can you speak to what you're seeing on the pipeline base business side? I mean, specifically, I mean, how much do you see this market growing in '17? And how should we think about the mix if we're looking at first half of this year versus second half?","Duke Austin","I mean, I'll make a general comment on it. We've talked about the integrity business in our LDC, our local distribution markets, and the sustainability of that over the - there's 20 to 30 year bills as you get low natural gas prices, low interest and they're able to lock in long-term bills. I think it's good for the ratepayer. It's good for our customers. So as you see that, you'll start to see them announce it in their capital budgets and we're executing on those CapEx projects across multi-years, 20 or so years. We like the market. We think we can grow it double digits. And then that piece of business, it's a long-term stable type work. It does have lower margins than your larger diameter pipeline work. And it does have more cyclicality as you go into the winter months, just the way it is. So it's just, in general, lower margins, more seasonality, but its good business and a good long-term business and we understand the risk on it.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Rygiel of FBR. Please go ahead.","Alex Rygiel","Thank you and thank you for taking my questions. First question, you increased your revenue guidance a little bit despite the loss of the pipeline project. So did you raise because of upside in electrical awards or did you raise because of upside in pipeline awards or did you raise because of increased confidence in kind of the core business?","Derrick Jensen","Yes. It's a little bit of all. I mean, we have since the cancellation actually already been awarded a few, subsequent with the quarter, additional contracts, smaller contracts that offset that individual cancellation, but then also, the strength of the first quarter. And then, lastly, as you said, I mean, it's a little bit more visibility in both the electric power MSA work that's coming forward as well as Duke talked about the potential for some of these additional oil and gas awards. So it's a little bit of a combination of all.","Alex Rygiel","And then you added 1,000 employees in the quarter, but revenue guidance is sort of flat going into the second quarter. So what am I missing?","Derrick Jensen","Well, I mean, what we're saying is that it's possible for it to be flat. At the high end, it talks about that there's a sequential growth coming into the second quarter and in the third quarter. But a lot of those employees also have to do with electric power.","Duke Austin","Yes, Alex, some your spreads will come down as well in the quarter. So the net effect of that, as the spreads start to come off a bit in the quarter, it's just a dynamic.","Operator","The next question is from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.","Adam Thalhimer","Hey, good morning guys. The oil and gas projects that you talked about you're in late-stage negotiations on, how many of those have you been selected versus if there's still a competitive process going on?","Duke Austin","Yes. I just - I really don't want to get into it. I just - from my standpoint, we're in late stages negotiations on multiple large projects and I think it's - we'll talk about it more as we get them signed up. We talked about ACP so others have announced that, announced what's in their backlog, so you can see the type of contracts we're talking about with Atlantic Coast there.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay. That's helpful, Duke. And then the follow-up I just wanted to ask you. In terms of this positive multiyear outlook for oil and gas, is the - was oil price volatility kind of returning over the past couple of months? Does that concern you as it relates to the multiyear term outlook?","Duke Austin","Again, we watch that. Everything concerns me and so we stay on it, we stay and watch it and think about it and think about how it impacts our business and our customers. And so yes, we're watching it closely. Most of our projects are natural gas based at this point. And we're moving gas and that's baseload fuel at this - what we see going forward, it will continue to be baseload. If you look at it, it surpassed coal and your electric grid. You need redundancy. We like that business, LNG export. I think that piece of business is really good. Oil, we're watching it closely. It affects Canada more so than the Lower 48 as far as what we're doing on a daily basis. And it also affects the overall economy in certain areas. So we keep our eye on it. So far, we've kind of weathered through some of the lower pricing and the volatility in it. Our customers continue to spend CapEx on different things and with the low interest environment and low natural gas, so it allows us to get a multiyear view on many things in our business.","Operator","The next question is from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Brent Thielman","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Duke, your comments on - I was interested in your comments on some of these customers in the power area close to deployment as new kind of multiyear capital program. Just, one, I want to confirm that incremental spend to the big opportunities you already see out there. And then, two, what sort of opportunities do you see from these? Are they small, large transmission projects? Are the programs as big as what you're seeing out there today? I guess, any color behind the scenes there would be interesting.","Duke Austin","Yes. I think it's just - if you go to the major IOUs and specialty or integrated IOUs, nat gas and electric, if you just look at their CapEx and their OpEx budgets, they're giving five year guidance for the most part. As you look at that and you look at the incremental impact and how much more that is due to all the things that we talked about with grid modernization, it allows us to get more visible and work with them on multiyear builds as they get regulatory - they're getting their regulatory relief there and I'm able to talk to them about a long-term agreement in the rate base.","So I think it's good for the customer. Fuel's going down. They can invest in infrastructure and talk about a multiyear view. And this is unique over the last year, so you're starting to see this. And it's additive to what was already going on in the industry. So we like what we'd see. It gives us an ability to provide the solution that we think we're unique on and talk about multiyear programs and how we help with those. So we like that piece of business and think it's something that's additive to what's been going on in the past.","Brent Thielman","Okay. And then just one more on the communications business and maybe I'll ask a different way. The agreements you talked about potentially being close to executing with the big service providers, any flavor whether that's coming in the next quarter or are we still a few quarters out on that?","Duke Austin","The overall environment in the communications business is robust. They need people to build infrastructure. So as you see that, you can see I'm talking about it as well in our CapEx. You can see others talking about how they're putting on people. It's a big market. I'm optimistic we'll be able to sign stuff fairly quickly here.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Duke Austin","I'd like to thank you all for participating in our first quarter 2017 conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest on Quanta Services. Thank you, and this concludes our call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Good morning everyone and welcome to the Quanta Services second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. On the call, I will provide operational and strategic commentary before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our second quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance and multiyear outlook. We continue to execute on our core business and strategic initiatives and continue to believe that our end markets are strengthening. As a result, we believe 2018 and 2019 are firming up to be solid years for both our electric power and oil and gas segments and that Quanta is in a renewed multiyear up-cycle.","While the timing of when project contracts are signed and reflected in our backlog can be challenging to predict, we have good visibility into the overall CAPEX and OPEX spends of our end markets and remain in active discussions with our customers for billions of dollars of work. I will note that the timing for larger projects is currently more difficult to predict due to the lack of commissioner quorum at FERC.","Despite these challenges, we believe it is not a matter of if larger projects move forward, but when. We continue to believe end market drivers remain firmly in place and that we have the opportunity to achieve record backlog levels over the next few quarters.","Turning to the electric power segment, we are generally pleased with our performance during the quarter as mentioned earlier. We continue to invest in the workforce for our electric distribution business, which created short-term margin pressure in the second quarter, but it is necessary to support future growth. Nevertheless, we are on track to achieving our margin expectations for this year and continue to believe we have the opportunity to improve operating margins to double-digits as these investments pay off and our Canadian operations strengthen with the start of field construction of the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project.","Our customers are actively executing on existing capital programs. Small and medium transmission projects as well as distribution work remain active, and we continue to have discussions with customers about the solutions we can deploy for new large multiyear capital programs. These programs include both larger and smaller electric power infrastructure projects that are designed to upgrade and modernize the grid.","On prior calls, we have talked about and anticipated an increase in larger transmission project awards. Earlier this week, we announced that Quanta was selected by American Electric Power, or AEP to provide EPC solutions for the Wind Catcher Generation Tie Line Project. The anticipated contract value for this project makes it the largest award in Quanta's history.","The Wind Catcher Tie Line consists of approximately 350 miles of a single circuit 765 kilovolt power line and two new EPC substations in Oklahoma. We will provide turnkey EPC services for the entire project. Once completed, the line will deliver energy from the Wind Catcher wind farm in Western Oklahoma to customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas.","We are providing early phase project services to AEP. And subject to AEP obtaining regulatory approvals, we expect construction to begin in the later part of 2018 with the completion expected in late 2020. We have yet to determine whether the project will be included in the third quarter 2017 backlog.","Quanta has built more high-voltage electric transmission infrastructure in North America than any other specialty contractor. With industry-leading experience constructing 765 kilovolt lines, Quanta brings significant scope, scale and financial resources as well as a track record of safely executing large complex projects. We are also able to provide cost certainty to these projects like the Wind Catcher Tie Line, all of which, we believe, are competitive advantages.","We have agreements for and continue to discuss additional large transmission project opportunities with numerous utilities and merchant transmission companies in North America. Several of these projects are making progress through the permitting and regulatory approval process, with announcements possible in the medium-term.","Further, our ongoing investment in training through Quanta's world-class training facility, college and trade affiliations, and other regional activities, and our commitment to meeting the long-term needs of our customers sets us apart in the marketplace and will continue to pay dividends. We have added to that effort by helping form a non-profit line school. Although in the early stages, we believe this school will help to develop quality line workers to supplement our growing resource needs.","Our oil and gas segment had a good second quarter as we executed well on several mainline projects and other work, which resulted in solid operating income margins. Further, backlog held up well in the second quarter, especially considering segment revenues increased strongly over the same quarter last year. As a reminder, oil and gas segment backlog can vary -- variable due to its faster book and burn nature and the timing of larger pipeline project awards.","In July, Quanta was awarded two spreads of the Canadian section of Enbridge's Line 3 Replacement Project. Quanta's scope of the work includes the construction and installation of approximately 168 miles of new 36 inch diameter crude oil mainline pipe, which will begin in Hardisty, Alberta and continue into the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Construction is expected to begin this month and is anticipated to continue through 2019. This project supports our prior commentary regarding improved expectations to booked pipeline work for the second half of this year.","As I commented earlier, FERC currently lacks a commissioner quorum, which is required to provide final approval for major projects, including pipelines. Due to this uncertainty, customers have been reluctant to sign project contracts. A recent Bloomberg article estimated that there is $50 billion of energy projects that are held up and waiting FERC approval. The Trump administration has nominated candidates to fill all currently vacant FERC commissioner seats and we believe a quorum will be achieved over the coming months as commissioners proceed through the confirmation process. The majority of the pipeline projects waiting for FERC approval are planned to begin construction in 2018.","Quanta remains in late-stage discussions and negotiations on multiple larger pipeline projects, and we continue to believe that 2018 and 2019 will be active years. We believe a number of them will be awarded pending their receipt of FERC approval or perhaps earlier and should break ground over the next 24 months. ","A couple of weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Stronghold, a leading specialized services company that provides high pressure and critical path solutions to the downstream and midstream energy markets. Stronghold is a strategic acquisition that will allow us to capture a greater portion of the industry operating and capital spends. With positive industry dynamics, visible cross-selling opportunities, and Quanta's support, we believe there is a multiyear opportunity for Stronghold's operations to achieve double-digit growth. ","Stronghold's recurring revenues, accretive operating income margin profile, and strong free cash flow generation align well with our strategic imperatives for long-term profitable growth. Since announcing the acquisition, a number of Stronghold's customers have responded very favorably and we have received inquiries from several customers that would like to learn more about the comprehensive solutions, a combined Quanta and Stronghold can provide them. ","The growth of our communications infrastructure services operations continues and our outlook remains positive. Our U.S. market expansion efforts are going well and continue to be very well-received by current and potential customers and we are actively pursuing opportunities with various U.S. telecom and cable MSOs. During the second quarter, we booked approximately $150 million of new project awards in North America, the majority of which were in the United States. We are in discussions with providers across North America and in certain countries in Latin America for projects worth several hundred million dollars in the aggregate, which, if we are successful in signing, would be performed over the next few years.","Additionally, during the second quarter, we completed the strategic acquisition of an established communications contractor that serves the Southeast and other regions of the United States with strong customer relationships. Now as a part of Quanta, we are growing the business and have strong support from its key customers. We remain focused on organically growing our communications services offerings. However, we will evaluate select acquisitions that bring strategic value to Quanta and allow us to provide differentiated solutions and that can accelerate our expansion efforts.","In summary, we remain on track to achieve our full year outlook, continue to have a positive multiyear view of the end markets we serve, and believe we are entering a renewed multiyear up-cycle for electric power, oil and gas, and communications infrastructure services operations. We are confident that Quanta is well positioned to provide unique solutions to our customers and capitalize on favorable end market trends.","Our small and medium-sized base business work continues to grow nicely and we are seeing larger electric transmission and pipeline projects move forward as evidenced by the Wind Catcher Tie Line and Line 3 Replacement Program projects. We are making progress with our U.S. communication services expansion efforts and see meaningful growth opportunities for our operations in North America and Latin America.","We are focused on operating a business for the long-term and continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core businesses and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mind-set will continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for all stakeholders. With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our second quarter results. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen","Thanks Duke and good morning everyone. Today, we announced record second quarter revenues of $2.2 billion. Net income attributable to common stock was $63.8 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared to net income attributable to common stock of $16.6 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.50 for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $0.18 for the second quarter of 2016.","Consolidated revenues increased almost 23% when compared to the second quarter of last year. This overall increase was primarily associated with increased capital spending by our oil and gas pipeline customers on larger pipeline transmission projects and increased capital spending by our electric customers on multiple types of services and project sizes. Our consolidated gross margin was 13.7% as compared to 11.2% in the second quarter of 2016. This increase was driven by improved margins in both segments, which I'll discuss later in my prepared remarks.","Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $185.9 million in the second quarter of 2017 or 8.4% of revenues as compared to $156.6 million or 8.7% of revenues in last year's second quarter. The increase in SG&A was primarily due to higher compensation costs largely associated with higher incentive compensation based on current levels of profitability as well as annual compensation increases and increased personnel to support business growth. Also contributing to the increase was $5.1 million in incremental G&A expenses associated with acquired businesses, which included a $3.8 million increase in acquisition and integration costs.","We also made a $2.4 million charitable contribution during the quarter. This contribution was an initial grant to help form a non-profit line school and to fund its operations for the remainder of 2017. We anticipate making future annual contributions starting in 2018, which with the school now established, we would expect to include in our future annual guidance.","To further discuss our segment results, electric power revenues increased 12.2% to $1.3 billion when compared to last year's second quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher customer spending in both our recurring type revenues of distribution and smaller electric transmission projects as well as a higher contribution associated with larger electric transmission projects as more of these larger projects were in construction during the second quarter of this year.","In addition, we had approximately $15 million in revenues from acquired businesses and $8.1 million in additional emergency restoration services revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in power plant-related revenues due primarily to a lower volume of renewable power plant projects and a completion of a power plant project in Alaska during 2016.","Operating margin in the electric power segment increased to 8.7% in the second quarter of 2017 as compared to 6.6% in last year's second quarter. This increase largely resulted from $30.5 million of project losses related to a power plant project in Alaska that were recognized in the second quarter of 2016, which negatively impacted margins in last year's quarter by approximately 260 basis points. Partially offsetting this increase in the quarter were slightly lower margins associated with our distribution services as we ramp on certain training and development costs for upcoming work as well as variations in segment margins due to typical seasonality and the timing of project start dates and completions.","As of June 30, 2017, 12 month backlog for the electric power segment was $3.6 billion, which is an increase of 1.6% when compared to March 31, 2017, while total backlog remained relatively constant despite record second quarter revenues for the segment. As compared to the second quarter of 2016, total backlog for the segment increased 6.5%.","Oil and gas segment revenues increased 42% quarter-over-quarter to $899.6 million in 2Q 2017. This increase was primarily due to increased capital spending by our customers on larger pipeline transmission projects. The increase in revenues from larger pipeline projects also drove the operating margin to 7.5% in 2Q 2017 from 1.9% in 2Q 2016 as these larger projects typically have a higher margin profile due to the associated risks. Additionally, the overall higher revenues in the segment allow for better coverage of fixed and overhead costs.","As of June 30, 2017, 12 month backlog for the oil and gas segment was $1.7 billion and total backlog for the segment was $2.4 billion, both representing slight decreases compared to March 31, 2017 and year-end 2016. These decreases are primarily due to burn of larger pipeline projects that moved into full construction. Our second quarter backlog does not reflect the July award of Line 3 and as Duke commented in his prepared remarks, we have been in active discussions on a number of pipeline projects, which gives us confidence in future backlog materializing.","Corporate and non-allocated costs increased $18.6 million in the second quarter 2017 as compared to 2Q 2016 due to $12 million of higher compensation costs, largely associated with higher incentive and non-cash stock compensation expense based on current levels of profitability, $3.8 million in higher acquisition and integration costs, and the $2.4 million charitable contribution to the non-profit line school.","For the second quarter of 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations were approximately $8.7 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $54.5 million, resulting in $45.8 million of negative free cash flow. This compares to free cash flow of $12.1 million for the second quarter of 2016. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2017 was negatively impacted by increased working capital requirements related to the increase in number and size of oil and gas infrastructure projects and to a lesser extent, electric power infrastructure projects, partially offset by more favorable operating results.","Regarding the two electric transmission projects in remote regions of Northeastern Canada where we have had previous billing delays, as anticipated, we reached a resolution on all of the outstanding issues. The amended contract eliminates the previous scheduling and billing issues and establishes new processes, which eliminated the access and delayed items mentioned in previous earnings calls.","After reaching this agreement, our net receivable position decreased as of June 30, 2017 and we have received additional payment subsequent to the quarter-end of $79.5 million. Total cash received from this customer during the second quarter of 2017 and through the end of July was approximately $277 million and the project is scheduled to be completed by year-end with no further receivable or billing issues anticipated.","DSOs increased to 80 days at June 30, 2017 compared to 74 days at December 31, 2016 and 74 days at the end of last year's second quarter. This increase was primarily due to more favorable billing terms for certain projects ongoing in 2016 as compared to projects ongoing in 2017.","At June 30, 2017 we had $99.6 million in cash. We had $324.7 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding and we had $480.7 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with $1.1 billion in total liquidity as of June 30, 2017. Subsequent to the quarter, we closed the Stronghold acquisition and increased borrowings on our credit facility by an additional $360 million related to the cash consideration for the acquisition.","Considering our expected performance for the rest of the year and our typically stronger back half of the year free cash flow, we believe we will see our end of year leverage profile within our preferred 1 to 1.5 times EBITDA range. We believe this leverage profile allows us to continue to be opportunistic with deployment of future capital.","In May of this year, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a $300 million stock repurchase program. The authorization covers a three year period and we anticipate utilizing the repurchase program opportunistically as well as to potentially offset dilution from stock issued to fund acquisitions or under our equity compensation programs. To-date, we have made no repurchases under this authorization.","Turning to guidance, we are increasing our full year 2017 revenue expectation to range between $8.65 billion and $9.05 billion. Our range of guidance contemplates the potential for project delays and cancellations. Fourth quarter revenues are still expected to decline compared to the third quarter of 2017. Based on our full year revenue expectation, we expect double-digit growth percentages in electric power in 2017 over 2016 and including results of Stronghold, we expect oil and gas revenue to increase around 20% to 30% over 2016.","We continue to see operating margins for electric power in the 9% to 9.5% range for 2017 and oil and gas segment operating margins, in part reflecting the margin accretion from Stronghold, to now be between 5.5% and 6% for 2017. Due in part to the increased borrowings for Stronghold, we anticipate interest expense for the year to be approximately $17 million to $18 million. Also, the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project began construction in the third quarter. As such, we can now more accurately anticipate the construction offset associated with our investment in the project, which will be recorded as other expense below operating income. Our forecast for the year for other expense is now approximately $7 million to $9 million. Non-controlling interest deductions have also increased slightly and should be between $1.5 million and $2.5 million for the year.","We anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year to be between $1.57 and $1.75 and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $1.92 and $2.10. Included in our outlook is the expectation that for the remainder of 2017, the acquisition of Stronghold is expected to generate approximately $240 million to $260 million of revenues and approximately $6 million to $7.5 million of net income attributable to common stock. ","The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Quanta's GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock by $0.02 to $0.03 and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock by $0.06 to $0.07 for the remainder of the year. Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share represented or presented in our release.","Our full year 2017 guidance reflects foreign exchange rates comparable to the first six months of 2017. Although Canadian and Australian rates have strengthened against the U.S. dollar a bit in the last few weeks, we have not considered this increase in our updated annual guidance. Fluctuations of foreign exchange rates could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and could cause actual financial results to differ from guidance. Shortly after this conference call, we will post a summary of our guidance expectations in the Investors & Media section of our website.","We are committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, which positions the company for continued growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital, capital expenditures, and organic growth. We continue to see acquisitions as a fundamental component of our strategy and with the formation of First Infrastructure Capital earlier this year, we also see continued if not incremental opportunities for investments supporting our customers and the development of incremental backlog for Quanta. While our stock repurchase authorization offers us the additional option to return to stockholders, we will continue to take an opportunistic approach among all components of our capital allocation.","This concludes our formal presentation. And we will now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from Matt Duncan of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. ","Matt Duncan","Hey, good morning guys. So, first question I've got, Duke, you talked about this a little bit in your prepared comments. It's regarding the lack of a quorum at FERC. And it sounds like you still feel pretty darn good about the outlook for 2018 and 2019, pretty on par with your comments from the analyst meeting back in early April. At what point would the lack of a quorum at FERC become a problem potentially, for revenues and profits in 2018? When do you think you need to see that by, for everything to stay on track timing-wise into 2018?","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","Yes, good question. From our standpoint, what we're hearing from customers and how we're looking at schedules, we believe that everything that we're hearing that there will be a quorum, number one. I think yesterday or day before yesterday, some of them moved through committee, so that's a good thing and a good sign. We're not here to predict when that's going to happen. D.C. has been -- every day is something new. So we don't know, but our customers are optimistic and so are we.","As far as when we need to get it, it depends on the regulations and what area you're in and how much they relax those as well. What we're hearing is good things about some of the relaxed -- relaxing some of the regulations on us as far as clearing and things of that nature will ease the construction and so you could get later in the year. But as we see it right now, we're optimistic that the quorum will happen and we'll get approvals on some of these larger projects.","Matt Duncan","Okay. And the second question, on Stronghold actually. Not long after you guys announced that deal, there was another public industrial services company that preannounced a pretty messy second quarter. So can you help give people a little bit of peace of mind here on sort of how your business -- how that business, I guess, has held up better than other industrial services companies? What is it that makes it a more sticky business that's been able to grow that you think you can continue growing? And then, maybe talk a little bit more about what some of the cross-selling opportunities are that you see there and the revenue opportunity associated with those markets.","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","Yes. So in general, the industrial service business, we've been in it a long time, and we performed very well on our high-voltage side down. So we understand the market and we understood the others that have -- came out with announcements and where they were at as well when we made this acquisition. We fully understand.","So that being said, what we do is we're critical path on both sides of that. And it's necessary -- our services are necessary in any turnaround and also in any cost structure that you would have in a turnaround. So if you wanted to expedite a turnaround, we believe that what we do is critical from our handling capabilities on the catalyst side to our high voltage side as well. So those two things are extremely important as well as all your ancillary services around that.","That being said, the company that we bought has a five year track record plus a double-digit growth as well as a margin profile that's industry-leading, and we're confident in our guidance and what we bought. We're happier today or as happy today as we were when we purchased the company and believe the company itself fits in well. And everything that we've seen has been great as far as the management team and we're extremely happy and they fit in well as far as that goes.","As far as cross-selling, we've been able to cross-sell already and have good client conversations about how the two put together and we can do unique things on the turnaround side.","Operator","The next question is from Tahira Afzal from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Tahira Afzal","Hi, guys and congrats on a decent quarter. I guess, first question. If you look at your comments in the past, Duke, about record backlog this year, would those still hold if you don't book Wind Catcher in the third quarter or did that project just come out of the blue in terms of timing of booking?","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","My comments were pre-Wind Catcher. And I also want to reiterate on the quarter, I think we had an exceptional quarter. We're right on track. We think that, from what we see, the markets and also our guidance is intact and we're affirming as well as increasing as far as I'm concerned.","Tahira Afzal","Got it, and I agree based on what I saw today. And, I guess, the second question, Duke, we track these transmission projects pretty closely. It seemed like this one popped out, at least for us, out of nowhere a week before you announced it. Have you seen some of the regulated utilities that have been a little more slow in terms of announcing larger projects come back on the map?","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","Yes, Tahira I think you know we've been consistent in talking about our base business, which is particularly about 85% of what we do on any given day is our base business. The larger projects are a small piece, 15% of the business. So we're around the edges on them all. We talk to our customers all the time. We're involved in many, many projects, some as big as Wind Catcher, some not. But in general, we understand the markets. We understand the end markets and then we're able to get in front of that and provide solutions. We've said all along, we need to be solution-based. We need to able to program manage. We got out in front of some engineering capabilities, and it's consistent with what we've said for the previous years and where we're going with the company as far as the solution base. And our relationships with the clients and our execution capabilities are exceptional. Our guys in the field are just exceptional.","Operator","The next question is from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. A nice quarter and bookings. I guess two questions; one, Duke, longer-term or Derrick, you guys put out at your analyst meeting your medium-term targets of the $10 billion in revenues. With the Wind Catcher project in Line 3, just sort of how you're thinking about the time line associated with the $10 billion, does that get pulled forward to some degree maybe to three year versus five year and confidence that margins will come through, given some of these bookings? And then, I guess, just the second question, I was pleasantly surprised by the bookings on the communications side. So can you just talk about the momentum you're seeing there and whether there is any upside to the implied revenue guide for communications in 2017? Thanks.","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","Yes, Jamie. I think, in general, what we'd say -- let me go backwards on the communications side as we've kind of commented on the $150 million to $200 million. We think we're on upside of that, the $200 million, as we sit today. And we're proud of where we stand there and what we've been able to do so far, primarily with organic growth there, almost holistically, organic growth. So we're happy with where we sit as far as the communications go.","I'll comment a little bit and turn it over to Derrick on what we said from a comment. When we gave the commentary on the $10 billion and what we said, we said we could see it. We never gave a time frame. We stand by that. We can see it. And so we see it; it's attainable. We wouldn't say it if we couldn't see it and I'll leave it there. I'll turn it to Derrick on the numbers.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes. Well, I mean, inherently I mean, our original discussion of that was excluding acquisitions. And so the Stronghold acquisition alone gives us a $500 million uptick to that number. And so based upon the guidance that you're seeing here for 2017, which is only inclusive of a partial year of Stronghold, I think that you would say although we're not in the spot of giving that multiyear guidance yet, that you would see a number in a much more sooner time frame.","Jamie Cook","And sorry, just the one thing you didn't answer, and Derrick, and I'll give this question to you because we've been going back and forth on this for a couple of years. Given the bookings that we're seeing, can we get confidence that, at least by 2018 we're back in our targeted range for electric transmission and, to some degree, oil and gas?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, I think that quite honestly, when you look at our annual guidance of 9% to 9.5% for electric power, for us to get into that type of range you're going to have to see a stronger performance in the back half of the year. And that stronger performance is going to be at or near that double-digit margin. I'll reiterate that over the last couple of years, I've spoken about, and it's the same thing for 2017, that electric power, excluding Canada, is operating at the double-digit margin range. As it stands here for the -- for 2017 as a year as well as even the second quarter, it was very near or at the double-digit margins, excluding Canada. And so the headwinds in Canada had put some pressure.","As we look at the back half of the year, it is some of the improvements in Canada because of the moving on to some of the larger transmission projects that are also helping to contribute to the higher margin profile for that back half of the year. So on an ongoing basis, we think that, that still bodes well for us to feeling comfortable with those double-digit margins on electric power.","Operator","The next question is from Noelle Dilts of Stifel. Please go ahead. ","Noelle Dilts","Hi guys, good morning. It was nice to see the Enbridge Line 3 win in Canada. It looks like you got about 25% of that Canadian mileage. So looking at that job, it looks like there is the two spreads scheduled to begin this year, six spreads scheduled to begin in 2018. So my question there is, is there any additional opportunity associated with those six spreads and then how are you thinking about the U.S. portion? And then, of course, any assistance you can give us to help us size that opportunity would also -- the portion you've won and then potential opportunity would also be great?","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","Thanks Noelle, I think, in general, that we basically work with Enbridge on the rest of the project. We bid some of it in Canada. There's another portion that will come out later that we'll bid as well. They're great clients. We continue to work with them, a collaborative effort across both Canada and the Lower 48. We're not -- I don't want to get into a bunch of comments on where we're at on specific projects for competitive reasons, but in general, great, great client and we look forward to work with them -- working with them on this piece of work.","Noelle Dilts","Okay, great. And then, can you just give us a little bit more color on the telecom acquisition, sort of what this brings to you from a strategic standpoint, maybe key customer relationships that maybe come in with this, how you think it could grow? And then, are you looking to do additional kind of smaller bolt-on telecom deals?","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","Yes. Noelle, it was a small acquisition. And it brought, actually, no backlog to us in the Southeast, but great client relationships and such. So we're able to leverage their client relationships across a broad spectrum and add our solution capabilities and some of the people that we had already. And we pulled them out of Canada and such and then really boosted our telecom operations and get a kick start in the Southeast. If we're able to do that in multiple areas, we'd do it, but it was a very small acquisition. I do not think we have a kind of a program as such as far as an acquisition profile in any way, shape or form going forward. We said we'd organically grow and I think that's the intent, but we're not going to pass up good opportunities.","Operator","The next question is from Alan Fleming of Citi. Please go ahead. ","Alan Fleming","Hi guys, good morning. Duke or Derrick, you averaged around 6% oil and gas margins through the first half of the year versus closer to 1.5% in the first half of 2016 and then last year you did 5%. So we know you want to keep expectations manageable for particularly the fourth quarter and you did raise the bottom end of the guidance there to 5.5% to 6%. But given kind of the confidence that you have in bookings and Line 3 coming in, I mean, is maybe the low end, at least the low end looking a little conservative now?","Derrick A. Jensen","No. I mean, I think that our primary concern is the timing of projects themselves. I mean, when you think about that, any of the projects in oil and gas specifically, can be moved -- whether it be the third quarter or fourth quarter, the timing of when the weather aspect and whether you are able to accelerate based upon the winter weather or not. So we're pretty cautious about that. And at the same time, I would still say that we still see a reasonably marked downturn between the third quarter and the fourth quarter because of the timing of when we're working on some of the larger transmission projects.","So you're right that we had pretty strong margins in the segment in the second quarter. But I think as we go forward and here in the third and the fourth, you should expect some level of margin pressure in the fourth and a big portion of that is us being cautious about how the winter builds into playing out.","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","Yes, a little commentary as well. When you compare it to 4Q of 2016, we are on multiple large spreads in the South and so that's not in our backlog as we see it today. So that's part of our comparable issue as well.","Alan Fleming","Okay, that's helpful. But maybe you can talk a little more about how you're thinking about cash flow in the second half of the year, DSOs around 80 days this quarter. I mean, what's your confidence in being able to get those down in the back half and do you think you -- a little bit more focus on working capital can help even as some of these larger projects start to ramp like Fort McMurray and Line 3?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, I mean, I think that, in my prepared remarks, I commented that we're typically in the back half of the year, we're a stronger free cash flow company and I think that will be very much the case here still for 2017. At this stage, I would tell you that I expect free cash flow to be stronger than it was last year. Previously, we had been forecasting that the Canadian work would have some delays in that, but obviously we have reached a substantial improvement of that here in the second quarter. That's going to contribute to the third and fourth quarter free cash flow. I feel pretty comfortable that we'll have a pretty strong end of the year in that regard.","Operator","The next question is from Chad Dillard of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Chad Dillard","Hi, good morning. So you mentioned that there is an investment in the distribution that caused margin pressure in the transmission during 2Q. Can you just talk a little bit more about this, could you quantify how much pressure there was? And is it only a 2Q event or do you expect that pressure to continue over the next couple of months? And then also, just moving over to oil and gas, were there any closeouts for that segment in 2Q, if not, were there any baked in, in the second half of this year?","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","Yes, I'll take the electric side of it. In general, I think what we saw in the quarter, we added 500 or so people. We've added 1,500 as we look at the year so far just without the acquisition. So when you're doing that, in the distribution business especially, it does create some inefficiencies. It was -- what we see in baseload work and how we're ramping on that certainly caused some unique issues as well as we are ramping on our telecom business. And so in the segment, it caused some unique variables. And I think that's not what you see going forward. When you look at this business as we do and give guidance over a period of time, our ability with utilizations and such that just goes away. But that was a unique kind of quarter where you saw some pressure. It was not that much. And as Derrick said, we were still in the double-digits in the Lower 48, but we thought we should at least comment to it.","Derrick A. Jensen","Relative to gas, I mean, we did execute two contingencies in a couple of our larger -- large diameter projects. That's -- we bake contingencies into these projects to deal with the risks inherent with them. But as we came to the second quarter, we were able to execute through and manage those contingencies so such that as some of those jobs neared completion, you saw that fall to the bottom as expanded margin.","Chad Dillard","That's helpful. And then, just moving over to Canada, can you just talk a little bit about the bidding environment on the transmission side? How's that changed in the last three to four months and whether you're seeing any recovery or have conditions softened in that market?","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","Chad, in general in Canada on the electric side, we see on the larger side -- large transmission side, we still see opportunities there. We've been disciplined about how we bid this work. We're starting West Fort McMurray now in the field and we're happy with where we sit there. We'll be -- we'll continue to be disciplined up there. We know our costs. We know where we're at, and we see it strengthening from a large project standpoint with non-core Nalcor as well as starting West Fort McMurray. And even when we come off Nalcor, we feel comfortable that we'll start to see that market strengthen due to that -- those projects as well as some of the base business coming back on your Eastern side of Canada as well as on your Western side of Canada. But in general, the overall economy is depressed due to the energy markets. We've been [indiscernible] that will help on the gas pipeline. So we are seeing opportunities there as well. But more importantly, I think our discipline on large projects and how we price work at states that size and we don't have any projects that we are off the rails or any issues, which I think says a lot about our execution capabilities as well as our bidding discipline as we move forward.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please go ahead. ","Cleveland Rueckert","Hi, good morning guys, this is Cleve on for Steve. Duke, just jumping back to the conversation about the FERC, once a quorum is established, how quickly do you think pipeline projects could actually move forward? I mean, are they pretty much staged and ready to go or is there additional citing and state regulatory requirements that need to be finalized?","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","I mean, I think, in general, the process within FERC has moved forward. The work underneath is ongoing, right of ways and things like that are getting bought, easements, all the necessary things within the state levels are getting done. We're optimistic on the ones that we're looking at or working or collaborating with our customers that we're moving forward. And as we stated before 2018 and 2019 we believe will be a robust environment. And so when we see that, again, it's mainly just waiting on the FERC quorum and final approvals, in my mind, to see us into 2018 and 2019.","Cleveland Rueckert","Okay. And then, I just had a question on the EPC power projects. When you guys book that work, how does -- and, I guess, how does Quanta's risk profile change? Is there any more or less fixed price risk on this type of work or is it really just more of an opportunity to expand into different areas of the project?","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","We've been -- we've performed EPC work for 50 years, primarily on the transmission side of the business, substations. So we're very familiar with EPC and the risk profile. I'm confident in our capabilities internally to perform that work on leaner construction. And again, we had the power plant that was a problem, but that was something completely different, something that we stated that we're not in today.","So that being said, we do understand the risk profile, having had -- of that project, on something that we didn't understand as well. So I think, in general, what you see and what you see in our backlog and our ability to perform on EPC, on electric side or the gas side, we do it very well. We're excited about the opportunities.","Cleveland Rueckert","Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Rygiel of FBR & Co. Please go ahead. ","Alexander Rygiel","Thank you and nice quarter. Duke, can you talk a little bit about the mix shift in your electrical business, particularly as it relates to increasing level of EPC work and how we should think about its effect on margin over the next two years?","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","Yes, Alex. We looked at that. I think, in general, what -- we can stay in our historical margins with the mix of EPC that we have today. If that changes, we'll come out and say so, but what we see today, we're very comfortable. And I'll let Derrick comment on some of that, but in my mind, I'm happy with where we're at. I think we can stay in historical margins. We're not there yet, but probably we'll be there and even with EPC, but I'll let Derrick comment.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes. The only thing being is, is that if materials is a larger component of the overall contract, in some circumstances, you see pressure on margins. But to Duke's point, to the extent that we have contracts where material component is larger and diluting the margins, it will be our intention to somehow kind of bifurcate. So people are able to see what's happening from the construction side versus the material side, but we'll have to just address that as the level of mix of those contracts come forward.","Alexander Rygiel","And I believe your revenue contribution from Canadian operations last year was around 20% of total company revenue. How should we think about that number changing over the next couple of years? And what kind of implications are there towards that change?","Derrick A. Jensen","That's probably right. It's in that 20% range. On a go-forward basis, we'll have to look at how, as an example, Stronghold and the like comes in. I think for right now though, between the markets that we see in the opportunity, whether it be in oil and gas or electric power, I think still holding something in that 15% to 20% range for now is likely a good number. We see double-digit type growth opportunities in the Canadian market as much as we do in electric power. So right now, I think I'd say you probably anticipate some sort of similar percentage.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Wittmann of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. ","Andrew Wittmann","Great, thanks. I guess my first question is on the pipeline side of the business. And you guys always have a pretty good sense about when -- on projects that your customers want to move on relatively urgently when you've got the awards. And so, I guess, I was just hoping you could give us a sense of the quantity of work that's pent up at the FERC that you know that once they do rule on it, you'll be ready to get to work in short order.","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","Yes, and I think we have consistently commented on this that we believe we'll be booked in 2018 and 2019 in the Lower 48. We stand by those comments.","Andrew Wittmann","But can you give a dollar amount to it, I guess, is my question.","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","I just did. We're going to stand by our books. We believe we have a robust environment. It's difficult for us to comment on what that is going to look like. And certainly, in 2018 to 2019, we're not going to give multiyear kind of quantification on it other than to say it's a robust environment and our spreads, we believe, will be booked in 2018 and 2019.","Operator","The next question is from Brent Thielman of D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead. ","Brent Thielman","Hey, thank you, good morning. On communications, is that running -- or, I guess, with the new work you've picked up and are looking at here going forward, any reason to believe that could potentially be accretive to electrical segment margins as that ramps up?","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","Yes, I mean, again, as you start to see utilizations go up and project mix go up when you see bigger projects and the big transmissions start to move back in, as we've said before, the margin profile and -- at the risk profile and margin profile, we believe we can execute through. Certainly, it drives your margins up, but again, our base load work and what's going on in there as well, it's not necessary, but it should enhance margins.","Brent Thielman","Yes, okay. And then, Duke, what is something like Wind Catcher moving forward due to the market. Can something as large as that be a catalyst to get other utilities moving a little faster on the programs or at least look to secure contractors like yourself?","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","Yes, I mean, I think, as far as we see it, the labor environment and the amount of labor and qualified supervision that's in the market out there today, we talked about in the past that we've been a little heavy in supervision in certain areas a year ago or a year and a half ago because we saw some of this coming. We're in a really good spot from a labor standpoint as well as working with our line programs and things like that. We saw some costs roll through there.","We got in front of the build. We consistently talk to our customers about what's going on and preplan and get involved with them on a collaborative effort. And that being said, it allows us to look at things like Wind Catcher and a multitude of projects, both on the merchant side and with our customers that -- most of over 50 years with us. So we stay involved with them and I think we're in a good spot and we really like the market going forward as I said before.","Operator","The next question is from Noelle Dilts of Stifel. Please go ahead. ","Noelle Dilts","Hi guys, just a couple of quick follow-ups. So first, given what we're hearing from some of your peers about weather impacts in the quarter, I was curious if; one, weather was meaningfully detrimental at all in the quarter and also if you had any meaningful storm work? And then second, I was wondering if you could give us just an update of what your mainline spread utilization was in the quarter?","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","Yes, Noelle. I think, in general, from a weather standpoint, I mean, we bid kind of a weather pattern in our work and certainly there was probably something across -- the Northeast, I believe, was pretty wet. Again, we looked at it. We looked at the weather patterns, we have historical, and we worked through it. And basically, some of our design is that we're in West, East, wherever it's at and we were able to execute through any kind of weather issues. I'll let Derrick comment on the storm.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes. I mean, we had kind of a typical quarter. We had about $25 million to $30 million worth of storm work this quarter.","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","And I think if you look at the business from a mainline and base work, and this and that, again, about 75% to 80% of gas pipe is base load work, not mainline, so -- magnitude.","Noelle Dilts","Okay, thanks a lot. ","Operator","There are no additional questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Earl C. Austin, Jr.","Yes. I'd like to thank you for participating in our quarter -- 2017 conference call. I'd also like to thank the 32,000 plus employees in the field for safely executing through the quarter.

Duke?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services first-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. On the call, I'll provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our first quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","As many of you know, in March, Jim and our board of directors decided the time was right for me to step into the CEO role as part of Quanta's leadership transition planning process.","I'm humbled and honored by the trust and confidence they have placed in me with this appointment. I feel fortunate to transition into the role following Jim's leadership and strong direction over the past five years. I'm the third CEO of Quanta. I've had the privilege to work with great industry leaders over more than two \u2013 my two-decade career.","I'm fourth-generation in the business and began working side-by-side with my father in the field. I've spent the last 15 years of my career at Quanta Services, most recently as Chief Operating Officer. I worked closely with Jim, Derrick and our founder John Colson and others to develop Quanta's strategic initiatives. As such, you can expect a continued focus on operational excellence in building a company for long-term profitable growth.","With that, we will continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class filed leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers.","We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset will also continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for our customers, stockholders and employees. I look forward to future conversations with you through the year and appreciate your support.","Quanta's first quarter results put us on track to achieve our full-year outlook. Revenues were $1.7 billion for the first quarter, diluted GAAP and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.13 and $0.23 respectively.","While these items declined versus last year's first quarter, which was expected, we ended the quarter with record backlog, which exceeded $10 billion for the first time in the company's history. We believe this bodes well for Quanta as we progress through the year and for years to come.","For our Electric segment, the volume of larger transmission projects revenues declined quarter-over-quarter and our Canadian operations are experiencing a challenging operating environment due to the Canadian economy. Despite these headwinds, our core transmission and distribution operations executed well.","We did incur additional losses on the power plant project in Alaska, which we have spoken about on prior calls. As we entered the testing and commissioning phase of the project, we experienced engineering and production issues that created additional construction costs. We revised our total estimates on the project to factor in these issues and additional time on the site, and recognized these extra costs in the first quarter.","Additional resources have been allocated to deliver a quality project to the customer and bring it to scheduled completion. Although, we anticipate putting forth claims for a significant amount of these costs related to these issues, we have not recognized any potential recovery at this point.","The project is more than 90% complete and we expect to finish it in the third quarter of this year. These losses were not previously contemplated in our guidance, which highlights the strong performance in our core transmission and distribution operations in the first quarter.","With respect to margins, I want to reiterate that we are committed to returning margins to historical levels. However, we are mindful not to compromise our core capabilities and long-term approach to growing the business.","We are proactively addressing our margins by adjusting our cost structure where appropriate, continuing to optimize the use of our equipment resources across the company, and providing value-added solutions to our customers.","We expect improved Electric margins \u2013 segment margins results this year and maintain our positive multi-year outlook on the North American electric transmission and distribution markets.","The industry drivers that we have discussed with you over the years remain firmly in place to spur infrastructure investment, such as an aging grid that requires significant investment to maintain reliability, the generation mix shifting to more renewables and natural gas and the implementation of the existing regulations.","We also see several new drivers that we believe will be positive for our industry such as the extension of the renewable electricity production tax credit, New York's clean energy standard, which calls for 50% of the electricity consumed in the state to come from renewable resources by 2030, and the Canadian government's clean energy initiatives and regional transmission plans.","We believe all of these are significant drivers for new generation sources, which will require greater transmission investment for great connection in the United States and Canada. The high-voltage electric transmission award opportunities that we have referenced over the last few quarters are exemplified by our recent contract with Eversource Energy to build a Northern Pass Transmission project, which was signed in the first quarter.","This project was previously submitted for the New England Clean Energy RFP as part of a competitive process seeking a transmission solution to advance the clean energy goals of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island and to bring clean energy to New England power grid.","If selected, the Northern Pass Transmission project will be an approximately 192-mile transmission line that will bring more than 1,000 megawatts of clean, affordable hydroelectricity from Canada to New England. This project was not reflected in our backlog at the end of the first quarter.","In addition, our distribution services continue to grow as our customers increase spending levels to upgrade aging distribution infrastructure and to harden the systems to better withstand extreme weather events.","The electric distribution market has been growing nicely for several years and we believe distribution investment could continue to grow. For example, estimates from the C3 Group call for North American electric distribution construction spending to exceed $35 billion through 2020.","Overall, we continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our Electric segment. We will continue to build our base business, while remaining nimble to capitalize on large multi-year project opportunities that develop.","Turning over to our Oil and Gas segment; revenues and margins were lower this quarter versus the same quarter last year, which was also consistent with our expectations. We expect improved performance for this segment as we move through the year, with the second half of the year being meaningfully stronger than the first half, driven by expected significant increase in large pipeline revenue contributions.","We expect to have a greater number of large pipeline projects in construction this year than any other year since 2010. The large pipeline market is very active with projects successfully receiving FERC and other approvals and an active bidding and negotiating environment. In the first quarter, we signed large pipeline contracts for an aggregate contract value of more than $800 million, which we expect to realize this year and next.","Looking forward, we continue to work with our customers on additional large pipeline projects and have visibility into significant project activity for the next several years. The need for natural gas associated with coal to gas generation switching, natural gas mainline system redundancy and increased natural gas demand, particularly in the Northeast, are all drivers of current natural gas pipeline demand.","And as LNG export facilities come online in North America and export volumes increase, we expect additional large pipelines will need to be constructed later in this decade to feed considerable volumes of natural gas to those facilities. While the LNG market is facing challenges due to low oil prices, it is a market we are watching with cautious optimism. We believe our natural gas distribution and pipeline integrity services have attractive growth opportunities as well.","The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, recently proposed new regulations, which should continue to drive multi-year opportunities in the natural gas distribution market as customer integrity programs continue to accelerate.","And finally, a strength of Quanta is our ability to be opportunistic. One of our strategic initiatives for long-term growth is to find adjacent market and new market opportunities. Over the past several years, we have been growing our telecom infrastructure services operations in Canada by leveraging our Electric Power services resources reputation and relationships.","We have also successfully greenfielded and grown our telecom infrastructure services operations in various Latin American markets. You may recall from our fourth quarter earnings call that we were recently awarded two sizable telecom concession projects in Latin America. We hope to leverage our telecom success in Latin America and to the Electric Power and other infrastructure service opportunities in that region.","Following the expiration of our telecom non-compete arrangement, a natural progression of these efforts and our success will be to expand our operations in the U.S. telecom infrastructure services market, which we believe offers a significant long-term growth opportunity. We will currently perform limited telecom-related infrastructure services in the U.S., consistent with what is permitted by the terms of our non-compete arrangement.","I'm not going to go into detail about our strategy to return to the market today, but once our non-compete arrangement expires later this year, we envision growing our telecom infrastructure services business in the United States. In summary, we expect a significant increase in activity levels in the second half of the year and are on track to achieve our full-year outlook. We continue to have a positive multi-year view on the end markets we serve and believe we are well positioned to serve the expanding needs of our customers.","Quanta's entrepreneurial business model is unique and a critical driver of our success. We believe we have the best leadership and the best skilled workforce in the markets we serve. The combination of acquisitions and organic growth has allowed us to build a nimble company with a comprehensive breadth of self-perform infrastructure solutions, which significantly distinguishes us in the marketplace. All of this positions us to generate long-term shareholder value while maintaining the core values that have served us well through changing market conditions.","With that, I will now turn over the call to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of the first quarter results. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.71 billion for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $1.86 billion in the prior year's first quarter. Net income from continuing operations was $20.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations of $47.7 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2015.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release, was $0.23 for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $0.28 for the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily a result of fewer ongoing larger electric transmission and large-diameter pipeline projects in the current quarter, resulting mainly from fluctuations in project timing and regulatory delays on certain mainline pipe projects and to a lesser extent from reduced demand for services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending.","In addition, consolidated revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $32 million, or 1.9%, compared to the first quarter of 2015 when quantifying the estimated impact of changes in foreign exchange rates between the quarters. Partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of approximately $30 million in revenues generated by acquired companies, primarily in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.","Our consolidated gross margin was 11.9% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 12.8% in the first quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to increased costs associated with continued engineering and production issues on a power plant construction project in Alaska that resulted in $21.3 million of project losses recorded during the first quarter of 2016, and the previously mentioned decrease in revenues from large electric transmission and mainline pipe projects, which typically yield higher margins.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were $158.5 million in the first quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $13.1 million as compared to the first quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to severance costs associated with the departure of Quanta's former President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as severance and restructuring costs associated with certain operations, primarily within the Oil and Gas segment, which totaled approximately $6.3 million.","In addition, increases were from $3.6 million in incremental general and administrative costs associated with acquired companies and $3.6 million in higher salaries and benefits costs largely associated with cost-of-living increases.","Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 9.3% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 7.8% in the first quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the severance and restructuring costs previously \u2013 mentioned previously, as well as reduced revenues for the first quarter of 2016.","To further discuss our segment results, Electric Power revenues were $1.19 billion, reflecting a decrease of $53.3 million quarter-over-quarter, or approximately 4.3%. Quarter-over-quarter revenues were adversely impacted by reduced customer spending, primarily associated with large electric transmission projects. Foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted first-quarter 2016 revenues in this segment by approximately $18 million.","These negative factors were partially offset by the contribution of approximately $25 million in revenues from acquired companies and approximately $12 million in higher emergency and restoration services revenues. Operating margin in the Electric Power segment decreased to 7.4% in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 8.8% in last year's first quarter.","This decrease was due to increased costs on the power plant project in Alaska during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, the decrease in revenues from a large electric transmission project mentioned previously negatively impacted this segment's margins as our revenue mix shifted to a higher proportion of smaller scale transmission work.","Although, we experienced strong execution on transmission work overall this quarter, this change in revenue mix inherently carries a higher degree of inefficiencies associated with transitioning between smaller projects that are not experienced during continuous production on larger projects, as well as certain large transmission resources being underutilized during the first quarter of 2016.","As of March 31, 2016, 12-month backlog for the Electric Power segment decreased by 1.4% and total backlog increased 1.4% when compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in total backlog was largely attributable to approximately $90 million of favorable changes in currency rates.","Oil and Gas segment revenues decreased quarter-over-quarter by $94.4 million or 15.2% to $526.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. This decrease was primarily a result of fluctuations in large project timing, regulatory delays on certain large mainline pipe projects, and to a lesser extent, reduced demand for services due to lower oil prices and their impact on customer spending. Segment revenues contributed from our international operations were negatively impacted by approximately $14 million, as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rates in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015.","Operating income for the Oil and Gas segment as a percentage of revenues decreased to 1.1% in 1Q, 2016 from 3.9% in 1Q, 2015. This decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenues was due to the decreases in revenues from large-diameter pipeline projects, which typically carry higher margins, the impact of lower overall revenues reported by this segment, which negatively impacted this segment's ability to cover fixed and overhead costs, as well as the impact of approximately $2 million in severance and restructuring costs.","12-month backlog for the Oil and Gas segment increased by $584.5 million, or 30.8%, and total backlog increased to $608.2 million or 19.8% when compared to December 31, 2015. These increases were due to the award of several large diameter gas transmission projects during the quarter. It is worth noting that as a result of these awards, as of the end of the first quarter, the midpoint of our annual revenue guidance does not include any uncommitted revenues associated with large diameter pipeline projects.","Corporate and non-allocated costs increased to $6.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 1Q, 2015, primarily as a result of $4 million in costs associated with the departure of Quanta's former President and Chief Executive Officer. For the first quarter of 2016, operating cash flow from continuing operations provided approximately $199.7 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $42.6 million, resulting in approximately $157.1 million of free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $122.4 million for the first quarter of 2015. Free cash flow for the quarter of 2016 was positively impacted by lower working capital requirements due to fewer ongoing large electric transmission and large diameter pipeline projects in the quarter.","DSOs were 76 days at March 31, 2016 compared to 75 days at December 31, 2015 and 84 days at March 31, 2015. DSOs were lower at March 31, 2016 compared to March 31, 2015, primarily due to favorable billing terms for certain large projects ongoing in 2016.","Investing cash flows of continuing operations during the first quarter of 2016 were impacted by aggregate cash consideration paid of approximately $39.7 million, net of cash acquired, related to the closing of three acquisitions during the quarter.","Financing cash flows of continuing operations during the first quarter of 2016 were impacted by net repayments of $75.2 million under our credit facility. At March 31, 2016, we had approximately $155.3 million in cash.","At the end of the quarter, we had about $321.1 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments and we had $397.7 of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $1.25 billion in total liquidity as of March 31, 2016.","As previously mentioned in our fourth quarter earnings release call, we only provide annual guidance and will adjust our expectations as we move through the year, if needed.","For the year ending 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. This range contemplates Electric Power segment revenues ranging from a decline of around 5% year-over-year at the low end of our guidance to revenues in the segment remaining flat at the higher end of our estimates, with the remaining difference in revenues coming from growth in the Oil and Gas segment.","As it relates to seasonality, I would generally assume usual seasonality through the year with the first quarter being the lowest with respect to consolidated revenues and margins. We continue to expect revenue and margin improvement sequentially in the second quarter and again in the third quarter with the third quarter expected to be the strongest quarter of the year.","I would assume revenues and margins in the fourth quarter to fall somewhere between that of the second and third quarter and that overall the second half of the year to be more heavily weighted than the first half of the year.","Consistent with our previous guidance commentary, we expect a more pronounced difference between the quarters of 2016 than we have experienced in recent years. We expect a sizable ramp-up in revenues through the third quarter, as we expect a significant number of large pipeline projects to begin moving to construction in the second and third quarters of this year.","For 2016, we believe margins will continue to be at levels lower than our historical expectations, with the Electric Power segment margins somewhere in the 8% to 9% range, and Oil and Gas segment margins between 5.5% and 7%.","In addition, largely due to ramp-up in revenues I spoke of earlier, we expect margins to reflect a fair degree of seasonality with a more pronounced effect through the year in Oil and Gas segment, due largely to the anticipated timing of large pipeline project starts.","We estimate that interest expense will be between $15 million and $20 million for 2016 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for 2016 to be between 36.5% and 37.5%. Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects foreign \u2013 current foreign exchange rate environment.","Continued movement of foreign exchange rates in the future could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and could cause actual financial results to differ from guidance. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share for the year ended 2016, we are assuming 156.9 million weighted average shares outstanding.","Consistent with our previous guidance, our estimates include the reduction in shares in April 2016 associated with the final settlement of the shares delivered under the ASR program. The actual shares delivered as part of that settlement was approximately 9.4 million shares. This brings the total shares retired under the arrangement to 35.1 million shares at an average price of $21.36. In total, under our previously authorized $1.25 billion share repurchase program, we've acquired $1.2 billion of stock at an average of $22.10.","Under the current and most previously completed share repurchase programs, we have now repurchased approximately $1.7 billion or 71.7 million shares of our common stock. This has reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 32% and reduced them to the level we last had almost a decade ago.","This, while Quanta is now nearly four-times the revenues of our company back then, and while maintaining the current leverage profile of less than one turn of EBITDA. We would intent to use the remaining $50 million available under our 2015 program to repurchase additional shares opportunistically, depending on the overall capital needs of the company.","In spite of the incremental project loss recorded during the first quarter, we continue to anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.30 and $1.50, and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.61 to $1.81.","Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on the basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release. CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $200 million to $220 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million.","We expect to continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, positioning the company for continued internal growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with the focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth, and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and repurchase of Quanta stock.","Lastly, I worked closely with Jim throughout his entire 17-year career at Quanta, and we all want to thank him for his many and significant contributions. Through his years here he helped put in place much of the foundation that made this organization a success.","He was a valued leader and we all wish him well. Jim and Duke forever worked as a team, such that for us, the transition to Duke as our CEO is natural, anticipated, and supported by our entire organization and we look forward to many successful years with his leadership.","This concludes our formal presentation and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Matt Duncan with Stephens. Your line is open.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good morning.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","So the first question I've got is on the Oil and Gas segment. You guys obviously had a great bookings quarter there and I think if I heard you correctly you don't need any more bookings there to get to the midpoint of the revenue guide. But how are you expecting backlog to trend there over the balance of the year? Are you still seeing enough work that you think you can continue to grow that backlog level, even as you work off the high level of backlog you've got there now?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah, Matt. This is Duke. I think, again, backlog, the way it takes us a while to negotiate some of these larger projects. So I don't want to comment on exactly when backlog will come in. It's a robust environment, bidding environment on large pipe, as well as other MSAs in the Gas segment. I think we will continue be opportunistic there and able to book work. I just don't know the timing on it as we move forward through the year.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. No worries. In Electrical, if you take out the Alaska charge, the $21.3 million, it looks like that margin would have been about 9.2% this quarter. That's the highest margin I think you would've had since the first quarter of 2014. So I'm just curious how you think it's going to trend from here over the balance of the year and what you guys have been doing on the cost side to try and get the margins back into your historical target range?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. From a trend perspective, I think what we look at is that, inclusive of the charge that you'd have margins kind of progressing through the year. You're right that the first quarter margins without that charge are higher. We had some actually good weather this quarter throughout, had very good production on a number of projects, transmission and distribution wise, so that did come in a little bit higher than what we would have thought or had expected for the first quarter.","But, in general, we're going to stick with our overall 8% to 9% for the year because as we move forward through the year, we still have some of the pressure of lower contributions of large transmission work as compared to 2015.","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yes. And also, Matt, the breakup in Canada in the second quarter is obviously something that we'll take into account. And the more pronounced Canadian economy being down will affect us there in the second quarter. So it will be more pronounced in the second quarter. But, again, our goal is to get the 10% to 12% range in the Electric Power segment over time.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to Tahira Afzal from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, folks, and congrats on a decent quarter.","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good morning, Tahira.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","First question, Duke, when I take all of what Derrick has said and put it together, it seems like potentially if things go as planned, your third quarter could probably be the strongest cash EPS quarter you've seen?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Tahira, I think that's correct. Again, there's the projects, and it's definitely in the later half depending on where the projects go. So, the third quarter, yes, it's setting up to be the biggest quarter.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then, Duke, you talked a little more about telecom and there was some other news that came out this morning. Can you elaborate on what you are seeing there that's really making you jump in? You just got out of the sector a bit back and now it seems you guys are interested again.","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yes, Tahira, I don't really want to comment a lot about it other than to say what we said in our prepared remarks is that, we are in the business in Latin America and in Canada and stay that way. And so as far as the strategy going forward, we'll update you as we go forward.","But in general, we're always optimistic around things \u2013 or in line adjacent to what we do, and that's certainly is something that's adjacent to our markets we serve in different areas. So, again, we'll \u2013 and as far as what was said, I really have no idea other than to say that there is a public statement out there that has our whole buy-sell agreement in a website. So everyone can turn to that to look at what it says.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move next to Dan Mannes with Avondale. Your line is open.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good morning, Dan.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","First, Duke, congrats on the promotion.","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Thank you.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Sure thing. And then secondly, first, on the Oil and Gas business, you guys booked some pretty good mainline work that it sounds like is heavily towards 2016. Can you contrast that booking with the guidance? Was there any thought \u2013 did this just fill the gap, or can you walk us through maybe your thought process on why maybe this didn't even push guidance a little bit higher? Or is that due to the Electric side?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Dan, if you recall, in our last conference call, we talked about we had anticipated some of these awards to come through to fill the gap, and this is actually the closure of that. So it did just effectively fill the gap. We have no uncommitted large diameter work in our current forecast as it relates to meeting the midpoint. And then some of these projects still get rolled over into 2017. I mean, only roughly a little over half of it is contributing to 2016.","So, as it stands here today, we're not looking at doing anything from a guidance perspective. To a great extent, we continue to be cautious about how the timing of these projects would go. And mainly it's associated with potential delays, and we're definitely trying to take that in consideration overall relative to our expectations.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Makes sense.","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","And again, we continue to look at work throughout 2016. We're not stopping from that standpoint. We continue to bid and negotiate and look at work in 2016. But, like Derrick said, that should fill up what we said we would do.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Got it. And then the follow-up question is really related to your capacity. Given the amount that you've already booked, how much room do you have to add more work, and if you can contrast that U.S. versus Canada, for the balance of 2016?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, I mean, we have capacity, Dan. We're not at capacity on either side of it. Canada is probably softer than the lower 48 at this point in gas. But, we still have some room to book. We'll be cautious about how we go about it and where it's at. And again, the way the regulations are working with the state and federal getting involved in all these larger projects, we're pretty cognizant about how we talk about it.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. I guess two questions. One just broadly on your margins assumption for 2016. If I look at Electric Power, you mentioned another award that you booked, which wasn't in the first quarter backlog. Your margins ex the project were again at the higher end of what you're targeting for the year. If I look at the Oil and Gas business, recognizing the first quarter margins were weak, but we expected that, the bookings that you put up in the quarter and what appears to will happen throughout the year are pretty good.","I'm just trying to understand why margins couldn't potentially be higher, given the bookings that we have and the underlying profitability of the business. So is it still uncertain, while you've booked things, on timing? Is the pricing environment more competitive, so the stuff that we're booking is lower margin? I'm just trying to get a feel for why margins broadly couldn't potentially be higher, because the bookings are there, unless there's other projects that we're concerned about.","And then my second question, Duke, is a question to you more strategically. Back to the telecom business, while you can't give us your exact plan, as you're refocusing on the telecom business, do we read that as potentially longer term or an 18-month, you're not as optimistic about the growth opportunities that the Electric Power or the Oil and Gas business can generate? I'm just trying to think, is this incremental or is this a diversification strategy because you see one of the other businesses sort of tapering out? Thank you.","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yes. I'll take the last one first and just say, in general, we are always looking at adjacent markets and markets that our customers are driving us towards. So we feel like anything that we are going forward with would be an adjacent market or something that's strategic to us.","We've stated many times that if we're going in something we think it has the ability to be a $1 billion business as we look long term. And again, anything you see us doing, that's where we're going. And we stated \u2013 we don't want to get too far on the strategy on any certain one of them, but that is certainly something that we are looking at to grow us into the future.","As far as our end markets, our end markets that we're currently in today are robust. We are in the telecom market in Latin America and Canada, and it's a good market there as well. Our end markets today are robust and we're very happy with where we're at.","And anything that we are doing on the outside of that is additive and adjacent and strategic to us as we grow the business out in the long term. And as far as what's in backlog and where that's at and our margins for the rest of the year, I'm going to let Derrick answer that.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Jamie, overall, more specifically, I'll start with Electric Power, we are seeing a lower margin profile, but it has nothing to do with the bidding environment or the way we are approaching bidding.","I mean our margins in backlog from a bidding perspective are comparable to what you've seen in the past. What you've got, though, as we face the rest of 2016, you have a lower contribution of on larger transmission work. And those carry higher margins, so you have a higher complement of the smaller transmission work, which bears a little bit lower margin.","And then in addition, the Canadian economy overall has put pressure on the margins on the electric side there and we are factoring that into our expectations for 2016. So it's not a pricing or a bidding environment for us, it's really just the kind of the complement of the work that's contributing to 2016 versus what you've seen in the recent past.","Also actually you made reference to the project that we announced that is not in backlog. At this stage in the game that's also not in our expectations because it's not in backlog either at March 31, or in the second quarter. We've not place that project in backlog at all as of yet.","And then still yet and relative to the pipeline side, we are mobilizing on a lot of jobs all at the same time here into the second and third quarter and to that end, that bears a degree of risk and we've tried to take that into consideration in our margin expectations. Mobilizing on that much work, you want to be prudent how you think about the execution profile of that.","Lastly, as you mentioned, there is a degree of the timing of when that work falls. We try to be prudent with that, looking at how in the past we've had projects move from one quarter to another for some delays, inclusive of the fact that we anticipate some risk that projects could move, to a certain extent from 2016 into 2017, so we've tried to be prudent across both of those to take into consideration the environment we are working in.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go now to Noelle Dilts with Stifel. Your line is open.","Noelle Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. First, on the transmission market and addressing the shift in terms of the mix that you're seeing in terms of large versus small projects. When you look forward, when I look at the transmission market, it seems like we're starting to see fewer but larger projects out there on the horizon, and it also seems like there's a bit of a trend where some of the project developers are shifting or splitting up some of the larger projects into smaller pieces. As you look forward, do you think we're going to see a rebound in large project work or do you think that shift toward smaller project work is going to be around for a couple of years?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","As we look at the electric transmission market, we see the opportunity on these larger projects. They are there. How they go about executing them as far as from small to large, it's really customer driven. It's all over the place on that. So, again, we look at it on all sorts of ways as far as that goes. But our capital budgets, our core customers in the market and IOUs continue to grow. We continue to see demand in that market. And from our standpoint we see it long term. The transmission backbone is aging. The way you're bringing renewables on and the way you need to move power across the U.S., is certainly a demand for transmission.","So, we'll take advantage of small or large. The projects are there. We are going to adhere to our bidding profiles that we have in the past, which we won't win them all. So again, I think there is risk to the projects, we take that into account when we're bidding this work. And so we won't win all these larger projects, but there is the opportunity for us to win our fair share. And we like the market as we go forward on the transmission side.","Noelle Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then in Oil and Gas, I think on the fourth quarter call, you talked a bit about the gathering and smaller project work that you're doing in the Marcellus being down maybe on the order of 50%. Can you talk about if that's tracking in line with your expectations and how you're thinking about gathering work moving forward? Have we essentially bottomed in that market yet?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah, I mean, for the most part we participated in the gathering market in Canada and the Marcellus. So, we don't feel the major effects of all the shells being down. But for what we did do in the Marcellus, it is off some. But certainly offset by the larger diameter pipe moving gas through redundancy on your gas side as well as just moving it across Northeast. So \u2013 and in Canada, we do have some projects there moving gas as well. So, while it is off some, I think the larger diameter pipe offsets that.","Operator","Thank you. We will go now to Steve Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning and congrats, Duke.","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good morning.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","There were some big developments at Nalcor recently. Can you just talk about those two projects? Are you guys on track from a cost and timing perspective? How big a risk is there that your work is forced to slow down or maybe your inflow of cash payment gets kind of disrupted at all by the whole bore of rethink of the major projects there?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah, Steve, we're well into the project. And so we have not seen anything on the ground there that would make us think that the project would be canceled or delayed. We continue \u2013 I mean the material is there, the right-of-way is certainly getting cleared as we go forward. So I don't see any kind of disruption on Nalcor. It is remote. There is a lot of press in Newfoundland. So, again, we are cognizant of that. We are working with the project team and also we will be working with the new CEO as he comes in to make sure that we are both on the same page. And as far as where we are at, we are comfortable with our estimates on the project.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And you mentioned Northern Pass and a few positive developments in transmission. I know you've talked about this a few times on the call already. But I guess just to what extent has your view of the revenue growth potential of the transmission business changed over the last, say, few months? Are you now more positive about this being a growth business over the next 12 months to 24 months? Are you the same, less so? How's your view on the transmission market changed just in the last few months?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","I think the need for transmission remains, both in the lower 48 and Canada, especially when you tie in renewables and you need the backbone of natural gas. So the need is there. How the projects get developed and how they get out and when, is the key to it. And I think we are following all those larger projects, as well as the underlying need for the smaller transmission coming off the backbone as well. It's there. It's just how also the economy affects some of that smaller transmission as well. So, you have to take all those things to account. But saying all that, I would say, we're optimistic that the end markets transmission will be back and the larger transmissions will be back as we go forward. If not, we will adjust our cost. And again, historically we can remain in the 10% to 12% range for the long term and we view it a long-term business and we will be in that range, long-term.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. Just wanted to I guess talk a little bit more on Steve's earlier question about some of the Canadian projects. But you had the Fort McMurray West project with Adco that was \u2013 I guess was supposed to start sometime next year. With some of the softening in the Canadian market that you referred to, is that one still on track to start up, as well? What's the status of that $1 billion project?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yes, so we work with the ASO (48:05) there, who's our client on that project and we are meeting with them regularly, monthly, and we feel like the project is on track to go. It may expedite a little bit, but as far as we are concerned, it's on track and everything that they are telling us, there is a need for the reliability in Alberta. So, we will be getting started on that here later in the year or early 2017.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then there was an announcement of a fairly large privately-held pipeline company that actually filed for bankruptcy. Are you seeing stress from your competitors that maybe don't have the exposures that you have that are an opportunity for you to maybe move into some geographies where you weren't or maybe pick up some assets in M&A at a discount. I guess the question is, how much disruption is out there? Is this the first of many? Is this unusual? And what's the implication for your business?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yes, I don't want to comment on our competitors. Obviously that's in the marketplace and everyone knows kind of what's out there. What I will say is that the capital markets are there. We are talking to all of our customers about solutions. The risk of large diameter pipe is certainly evident in there and we understand that. When we acquired Price Gregory, we acquired them for that reason. Their expertise in large diameter pipe and the risk associated with it. We feel like we've got the very best management team you can get in that area and mitigated those risks and feel confident in our ability to execute on large pipeline projects. As far as the risk that others are willing to take, we can't control that.","Operator","Thank you. We will go now to Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital. Your line is open.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good morning.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","On telecom, historically the margins there were a little bit \u2013 they were consistently lower than T&D. And I'm just wondering if versus four or five years ago, has the industry changed at all? Do you think you can generate higher margins there going forward?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Anything, any business that we do adjacently will take the margins into account and make sure that they're inherent with what we believe is appropriate for the risk we take as well as our capital. So, we'll take in those accounts when we look at any kind of markets we are in, so if we move into that market, we would look at those things before we moved.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And I wanted to ask on the transmission side; previously you've talked about FERC 1000 being a driver and maybe even a driver for projects, specifically in 2017. Is that still how you look at FERC 1000?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","What I would say about FERC 1000 is, in general, it gets a lot of press. It's more about just merchant transmission, I would say, and just to say that there's a lot of things going on within our industry around merchant transmission and whether they go or not is very difficult. We are around the edges on all those large transmission jobs. We are involved in them, we see them. But again, it's our core business we are focused on, on a day-to-day basis and driving margin to our core business and that's what we are focused on, while we are around the edges on all the rest and the markets are good with or without FERC 1000.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning guys. It's Alan Fleming on this morning, in for Andy. Duke, have you seen any change in the bidding environment in Oil and Gas over the last couple months, with the rise in oil prices, and has the tightening in the mainline industry had any impact on pricing or terms and conditions yet?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yes. I mean, so natural gas \u2013 what we're really seeing is in natural gas removing natural gas. And it doesn't have anything to do with the price of oil in our mind. For redundancy to export LNG in places, various things, Northeast, you're going to have to have backbone gas to support your renewable infrastructure, and so that gas, the movement of it, is going to be there. It's economical, and so we'll continue to see that movement.","And as anything \u2013 when the market gets constrained at what you can do and the people that can do it, obviously the terms get better. We try to take a fair approach with the customer in good and bad times and negotiate a fair contract for us both and get the right kind of risk associated with it in any contract we look at. But we're in this for the long term. We're not trying to \u2013 we want to be in here forever, so again, we take that into account when we look at these contracts.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Let me ask you a little bit of a bigger picture question. The Alaska power plant project has been a thorn in your side for several quarters now, it looks like it will stretch into 3Q. Maybe you can just talk about some of the lessons learned from that project and how it could impact what you plan to kind of do in moving the company forward. And how do you limit these types of issues from coming up in the future as you try to move into an adjacent market, and is fixed price power a business that you want to be in?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good question. From my standpoint, we're going to focus on our core and look at our core businesses, what we're really good at, which is people and equipment. When we look at these adjacent markets, I think we've done a nice job over time of being able to create value for our shareholders in these markets. We do have a one-off project, that's more than a thorn to me, but it feels like a stick. But we are going to get that straight up in Alaska; we feel like we've got that at the right, we're set there, so at the right outcome and also with the customer.","What we're going to do on the Electric Power side is, we were in solar, we were looking at that and our customers, all of them are building some natural gas, so again adjacent market, our customer was driving us that way. We'll make sure that we negotiate good contracts when we look at those projects and have the right management team. We have brought in a seasoned management team here at Quanta on that project, so we're comfortable with where we're at there.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go now to Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Just wanted to push you a little bit on the large transmission projects; so bookings are pretty nicely in Electric Power during the quarter, but could you talk a little about what you're seeing in terms of mix of large versus small projects and then compare that to what you're seeing in revenue? I just want to understand what the trajectory is and how to think about the next 12 months to 18 months.","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yes, again whether you look at it from a large standpoint or a small standpoint in transmission, we do see both kinds of projects all the time. It's more about the capital budgets in the transmission market of our customers, and all those capital budgets continue to be robust. And so whether it comes out in a big large project or one that's divided into three, the project itself and the need for transmission is still there. And we see both, we have large transmission in our backlog, such as the one in Canada.","We continue to bid on projects such as the clean line Northeast clean RFP with Eversource. That's also something that we're looking at. If that goes, it changes the way the big versus small, but again, there will always be intermittency between big and small as we move forward. It's more about the whole capital budget and how we look at it internally. So we're focused on returning our core business in the Electric segment to the 10% to 12% with even small or large transmission.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then just moving on to Canada. What are you expecting in terms of revenues in that end market? And how are you thinking about where utilization is? Do you think you need to do a little bit of restructuring there? And can you pull some of your assets over to the U.S. to support some of the mainline buildout there?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, as it stands, I'd say that Canadian revenues are probably going to be somewhere in the 15% to 20% range. They're down a little bit as compared to what you've seen in the past. And then relative to costs and efforts there, I mean, a larger portion of what we're looking at from a margin perspective is focused on the Canadian operations. And in fact through the latter part of 2015, the largest reductions in cost have come out of Canadian markets.","So, we are very focused on ensuring that we'll be able to position that market to be comparable to, or complementary to, the efforts that we're taking to be able to get the margins back into the profile that Duke has spoken about. As far as the movement of people and equipment, we do look at that regularly back and forth between Canada and the U.S. It's all obviously very economic and market dependent and oftentimes job dependent. So we take advantage of that to the extent that we can, when the opportunity presents itself based upon the individual projects","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah. And I would say that geographically there's always cycles in the market and, by no means, the projects in Canada are there. It's just about when they come online or when we start bidding them. And we can't tell yet where that's at due to the regulatory environment there, but the demand to move both gas and product from east to west, and also if they look at some clean energy standards, you will see some dynamics go on with renewables there that will need transmission. So it's a robust bidding environment right now in Canada. But you just can't tell when it's going to move.","Operator","Thank you. We will go now to John Rogers with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open","John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Hi. Thanks. Just a couple quick things to follow up on. Duke, in terms of the acquisition strategy at this point, you had a couple of small deals in the quarter, what's your thoughts on priorities here, especially given your look at the market? And then maybe does that include telecom out beyond 2017, or you probably don't want to talk about it at this point?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah. Our priority is to focus on our core business and to return our margins back to what we expect. But as we look out from an acquisition standpoint, we will be strategic in how we make them. Again, we don't necessarily have a footprint today of a list of people that we're out trying to get or some certain company that we are after to acquire. It's more about just finding adjacencies where we can leverage what we already have and make it much larger. And we're also looking at ways we can grow organically. It's not just about us looking at acquisitions or enhance our shareholder value, if we don't grow. So, all those things come into play when we're looking at our strategy.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Sure. But at this point, given how you look at the market, what the competitive landscape looks like, what your needs are, are there more opportunities interest in Oil and Gas versus transmission, or any thoughts there?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","No, again, we try to fill a strategic area if we make an acquisition through adjacencies or whatever it maybe. The customer is also asking us to do different things, so we look at that as well. So all those things come into play. But I would say in general, we watch how much acquisitions we make in one part of the business versus the other. We want to be \u2013 make sure that we are geographically as well as service line have a lot of variability in our service offerings.","Operator","Thank you. We will go now to William Bremer with Maxim Group. Your line is open.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Good morning, Duke, Derrick, and Kip.","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good morning.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Bill.","Kip A. Rupp - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi, Bill.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","First question, just give us a sense, if you can, on the amount of spreads that you'll be utilizing in the second and third quarter. First question.","Second question. We've had a lot of weather issues in certain parts of the country, even subsequent to the quarter. Maybe give us a sense on what was the impact during the quarter and what you're seeing the potential impact in the second here. And finally, just an overall update and congrats on the announcement of the pipeline in Australia, but can you give us a little more granularity there?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah. So, let me take a little bit on the pipe. Again, we've said in the prepared remarks, we'd be on more projects than any time in 2010. I don't want to really get into spreads, because I think it's a loose term and I don't want to try to define that. But again, what we said is, we'll be on more projects any time besides 2010. So, it will be robust in the pipeline market.","As far as again, there's some fires in Canada. I know everyone's seen that in the news. We're worried about our workforce right now and making sure everybody's safe, and they are and our customers, and make sure their employees are safe. So we reach out to them right now and try to get that, that's our first and foremost what we're after today and into the week. But I don't foresee that being an impact to us. It would be minor if it was in the second quarter. And I think the rest of it...","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","The third part was Australia","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Australia, we did pick up a line in Australia, a condensate line and so we're happy with that and our guys in Australia are executing on that as we speak.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Bill, I'll add a little bit from the second quarter, I mean we do have, as Duke mentioned earlier, Canadian breakup to deal with and so that will \u2013 and probably see a little bit lower margins in Electric Power side from first quarter to second quarter. But more broadly, and to the other weather impact, it's too soon to say as to how the aggregate projects move, but we'll be mindful of the weather relative to the overall margin expectation.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our final question today from Jeff Volshteyn with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you for taking my question. Good morning. When you look at your recent projects that you won in the first quarter, can you share some color on kind of where they are located? Are they all mainline? How far along are they in their regulatory processes?","Earl C. Austin - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah, in general, when we're talking about projects in guidance, we take into account most of the regulatory issues. So those have been taken into account. As far as where they're at, we're not going to get into the details of the projects at this point, other than to say that we think we'll be executing on them and we'll be on more mainline than we have since 2010, and we'll continue to say that. So, that's kind of where we're at on.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And as a follow-up, just to clarify. So for 2016, I understand you don't have any uncommitted projects to get to the midpoint of your guidance. But how much of your 2016 revenues have you already won and you have in the backlog and under contract versus how much you still have to win to get to that midpoint?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Well, first a clarification that we have no uncommitted large pipeline projects. We do have uncommitted work in the Oil and Gas segment associated with the remaining portion of the business, the distribution work, integrity, things like that.","But then to that end, I mean, if we have no uncommitted that means everything is currently in backlog that we would anticipate to execute on relative to the midpoint of our guidance on that large diameter pipe.","Operator","Thank you.

On the call, I will provide operational and strategic commentary before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our third quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","We are pleased to report this morning that Quanta achieved record quarterly revenues, operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter. We also ended the third quarter with record total and 12-month backlog.","Our backlog growth to record levels was driven broadly across our end markets and customer base, including through the support of electric and gas utility customers, incremental programmatic spending, and our communication customers' plans to push fiber deeper into their networks in preparation for the 5G platform. We believe this supports our continued favorable view of multiyear growth opportunities.","We are focused on continuous improvement and accountability to our multiyear plan. We have executed well against our strategy over the past several years and expect that 2019 will be a record year for Quanta.","As a result of our performance and the addition of several previously announced strategic acquisitions, we are increasing our revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted earnings per share expectations for 2019.","We believe our solid year-to-date results and these increases in guidance demonstrate the successful implementation of our strategic initiatives, our strong position in the marketplace, and favorable trends for multiyear demand of our services. We also believe our results reflect the benefits of service line diversity and our portfolio approach to managing risk, while enhancing earnings power.","Our Electric Power segment performed well during the quarter considering several unique challenges that pushed out some revenues and softened margins a bit. I will note, however, that despite these challenges, our U.S. Electric Power operating margins were double-digit in the quarter and we expect the same in the fourth quarter.","During the quarter, we experienced certain production and labor challenges associated with short-term fluctuations in activity due to high fire risk periods and fire hardening initiatives in California. We believe this was due in part to the unprecedented demand for our resources in the western region of the United States and continued to work through these challenges with our customers. Because our customers' resource needs can change rapidly, we have taken a prudent approach to our fourth quarter utilization expectations.","That said, we believe efforts to fire-harden the power grid in Western United States to enhance safety and service reliability in response to wildfire risk will ultimately result in significant fire hardening grid investment that could last well over a decade.","In Canada, we experienced short-term mobilization delays that impacted resource utilization on two projects. While these effects have carried into the first part of the fourth quarter, we expect improved resource utilization on these projects later this year and further utilization improvements in 2020 and 2021 as construction begins to ramp-up on these projects as well as the Watay transmission project, which is expected to begin construction in the first quarter of 2020.","More broadly, we see continued strength in programmatic spending by our electric utilities on their transmission and distribution networks. We are collaborating with our customers and providing solutions that include large-scale distribution programs, sub-transmission system expansions and a range of technology solutions designed to enhance and modernize the grids of the future, which will benefit the consumer.","Quanta is increasingly managing large portions of these multiyear multibillion-dollar programs, which we believe are in the early stages and will be long-term in duration.","Quanta plays a critical role in facilitating the technologies and lower carbon footprint of the future. For example, the implementation and widespread adoption of new technologies and services such as electric and autonomous vehicles and 5G require power and new infrastructure. And the power grid of today must evolve if it is to meet those additional demands.","We are in active discussions with key players developing technologies, helping them understand the needed infrastructure and how Quanta can help execute their go-to-market strategies.","As these industries deploy new technologies and continue to invest in the future, we believe Quanta will play an important role that becomes increasingly apparent to the investment community.","We continued to gain visibility into the 5G deployment opportunity and believe it is large and that the build-out will take many years due to the density requirements of small cells and the massive amounts of fiber required.","We believe Quanta is uniquely positioned to provide solutions that bridge the gap between wireless carriers and utility companies as 5G infrastructure is increasingly deployed on the electric distribution system, which will require significant time and resources.","Our consolidated communications operations did well in the quarter and we continue to expect full year 2019 revenues of approximately $400 million. We ended the quarter with total backlog of more than $770 million, representing a nearly 18% sequential increase. Our U.S. communications operations are leading the growth and profitability gains for these operations.","We continue to believe we are on track to grow this operation to approximately $1 billion of annual revenue over the coming years. Next year, we see opportunity for double-digit revenue growth for our U.S. communications operations with operating margins approaching double-digits on a full year basis.","Our pipeline and industrial segment had its best quarter in several years. Revenues increased nicely, but more importantly, operating income was a quarterly record and operating margins were 9%, a meaningful increase over the same quarter of last year.","The strong margin performance was driven by solid execution across our operations with materializing benefits of scale from our gas utility operations, excellent execution on our big pipe work, solid results from industrial services, and strengthening midstream activity in the U.S. and Canada.","We have made progress over the past few years towards our upper single-digit annual operating margin goal. We know one quarter is not a trend. However, we believe this quarter demonstrates the profit potential of our pipeline and industrial segment and is evidenced that the margin improvement strategy we've implemented over the past several years is paying dividends. I think it is worth revisiting the key components of that strategy, noting what we have done and what we are doing for sustainable margins going forward.","First, for the last several years, we have been focused on increasing and gaining scale in the base business and diversifying the services and geographies of the segment to create a more sustainable and consistent operation.","The steps we have taken to achieve that include organic expansion of our gas utility operations, the acquisition of Stronghold to establish a leading industrial services capability, and most recently, the acquisition of the Hallen Construction Company, which further enhances the scale of our gas utility operations, particularly in the northeast United States, and improves the margins of our gas utility operations. Going forward, we will continue to focus on growing that base business, both organically and by opportunistically pursuing select acquisitions.","Second, we sought to right-size and rationalize underperforming and non-core operations. In 2017, 2018, and 2019, we shut down, restructured and sold underperforming non-core operations and assets in our pipeline and industrial segment that were previously impacting segment margins by more than 50 basis points. Much of this effort is complete. However, we continue to evaluate our operations for additional steps that can be taken to improve this segment margins.","And finally, we wanted to complete problem projects and focus our efforts on opportunities within our core capabilities. We worked through and completed various problem projects over the past few years that generated unacceptable results.","For example, in the third quarter, we reached mechanical completion on a processing plant that has generated disappointing results for several quarters and has masked the positive results of other margin improvement initiatives.","Going forward, we are focused on pursuing and executing work consistent with our core capabilities. We are confident that our ongoing margin improvement strategy is delivering results and puts us on a path to achieve upper single-digits annual operating income margin goal.","We continue to evaluate opportunities to strategically expand our pipeline and industrial operations as we gain scale and diversity. We believe the result will be a segment with higher margins, less cyclicality, and high-quality repeatable and sustainable earnings streams.","Though we have more work to do, we are proud of our accomplishments to-date and want to recognize the dedication of our field leadership to that end. Over the years, we have also executed on a strategy to mitigate risks inherent to -- in our business, including economic risk due to diversification.","We have a diverse customer base with low customer concentration, a broad and diverse geographic presence and a diverse and expanding line of services. We believe our diversification strategy, favorable industry dynamics, and the strategic investments we have made will continue to benefit our results over a multiyear cycle.","We are confident in our long-term strategy and are focused on generating a more resilient and predictable earnings stream. Our end markets and visibility are strong, and we continue to believe we're in a multiyear up cycle with opportunity for continued record backlog this year and in 2020.","On a consolidated basis, approximately 90% of our 2019 estimated revenue is expected to come from base business activity. We believe we can grow those revenues at a mid to upper single-digit CAGR over at least the next three years.","Additionally, we continue to pursue billions of dollars of electric transmission and pipeline project opportunities and believe some could be awarded over the coming quarters.","While we provide our formal commentary and 2020 expectations on the fourth quarter earnings call next February, we currently expect growth in consolidated revenues, net income, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share in 2020 and for Quanta to achieve another year of record results. We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and expect to continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership.","We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's base business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model, and entrepreneurial mindset form the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO for his review of our third quarter results. Derrick?","Derrick Jensen","Thanks Duke and good morning everyone. Today, we announced record third quarter 2019 revenues of $3.35 billion, a 12% increase over the third quarter of 2018. For the third quarter of 2019, net income attributable to common stock was $136.1 million or $0.92 per diluted share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, was a record $1.14.","Our Electric Power revenues increased 16% when compared to the third quarter of 2018 to $1.88 billion and represent record quarterly revenues for this segment. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth for the electric power segment, which continues to be driven by base business activities as our utility customers expand their investment in grid modernization and infrastructure hardening, particularly in the western U.S.","The strength of the base business in the third quarter of 2019 offset approximately $100 million in reduced revenues from larger projects when compared to 3Q 2018. Also contributing to the increase were approximately $50 million in revenues from acquired companies.","Telecom revenues, which are included within our Electric Power segment, were slightly over $100 million with growth largely driven by our U.S. operations. Our U.S. telecom revenues have grown sequentially each quarter since the first quarter of 2017 when we officially reentered the U.S. telecommunications market.","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment was 9.4% in the third quarter of 2019 versus 11.1% in 3Q 2018. This decrease is primarily attributable to the revenue contribution and solid execution in the third quarter of 2018 on the Fort McMurray transmission project in Canada, which was completed earlier this year.","Comparatively, during 3Q 2019, our electric operations in Canada were negatively impacted by delays on certain larger projects as well as record rainfall across parts of Alberta and Manitoba.","Margins in our telecommunications operations were mid-single-digit led by performance in our U.S. telecom operations, but dilutive to overall segment margins. Excluding our telecommunications operations, Electric Power margins were 9.6% for the quarter.","Our pipeline and industrial segment revenues increased 8% when compared to the third quarter of 2018 to $1.48 billion. This increase is primarily due to elevated levels of smaller transmission and pipeline projects and gas distribution services, which offset a decline in revenues from larger pipeline projects. Additionally, third quarter revenues for 2019 included approximately $40 million from acquired companies.","Operating margin for the pipeline and industrial segment was 9% in 3Q 2019, an increase over the 7% margin in 3Q 2018. The margin -- the improvement in margin was primarily driven by strong execution across both larger pipeline projects and our gas distribution services.","Additionally, the third quarter of 2018 was negatively impacted by project losses associated with the processing facility Duke referenced that has now reached mechanical completion as well as challenges encountered on natural gas pipeline project in the northeast of the United States. The projects combined to impact 3Q 2018 margins by slightly over 200 basis points, but had minimal impact on 2019's third quarter results.","Corporate and non-allocated costs increased $16 million as compared to the third quarter of 2018. This increase is primarily due to a $9.9 million increase in acquisition-related costs, $4.6 million of increased amortization expense, and a $5.2 million increase in expense associated with changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. These increases were partially offset by a $4.2 million net decrease in incentive and stock-based compensation expense.","Overall, 3Q 2019 adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was a record $312 million, a 14% increase compared to $274 million in the third quarter of 2018. This represents the first time we have exceeded $300 million of adjusted EBITDA in a quarter and illustrates the strength of our portfolio approach.","For the third quarter of 2019, we have free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, of $30 million. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $91 million and net capital expenditures were $61 million.","Days sales outstanding or DSO for the quarter was 91 days, in line with the second quarter but 13 days higher than the 78 days in the third quarter of 2018. Continuing to impact our DSO are balances associated with the Fort McMurray project, certain balances associated with pipeline that projects largely completed in prior periods, and elevated receivables associated with two customers that implemented further billing modifications during the quarter. Of note, the Fort McMurray retainment was collected in full in early October and represents approximately $100 million of cash flow in the fourth quarter.","Additionally, while billing modifications have resulted in elevated receivables, payments were received during the quarter, albeit at a slower pace, and no items are in dispute. Subsequent to quarter end, billing and collections associated with these customers is improving and has contributed to a positive cash flow for the first four weeks of October.","Excluding the impacts described above, DSO for the quarter would have been approximately 82 days, higher than 3Q 2018, but more in line with historical levels, which have averaged 79 days over the 20 quarters from 2014 to 2018.","Based on projected revenue levels for the remainder of the year, the collection of the Fort McMurray retainment and positive developments in billing and collection with some customers, we continue to expect DSO improvement between now and year-end.","We did not purchase any of our common stock during the third quarter of 2019 and had approximately $287 million of available authorization remaining on our $500 million stock repurchase program at September 30, 2019. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2019, we announced our fourth quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share totaling $5.6 million.","During the quarter, we amended our credit facility, which among other things provided for an incremental term loan of $687.5 million, and increased commitments on our revolving credit facility by $150 million to approximately $2.14 billion.","At September 30, 2019, we had $80 million in cash and $1.87 billion of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, $1.26 billion of which is borrowed under the term loans and $608 million of which is borrowed under revolving loans. In addition, we had $347 million in letters of credit outstanding, leaving us with total liquidity of $1.26 billion.","Our debt to EBITDA ratio calculated under our senior secured credit facility is approximately 2.1 times. This debt to EBITDA ratio is above our targeted operating level of around 1.5 times. However, is attributable to the acquisition activity in the period as well as the previously discussed pressures on our DSO.","With the expected DSO improvement and earnings contribution from acquired businesses, we expect the leverage ratio to return to targeted levels in the near term. As of September 30, 2019, our aggregate total remaining performance obligations were estimated to be approximately $4.4 billion, approximately 66% of which is expected to be recognized in the 12 months.","Our total backlog was a record $13.3 billion, an increase of 9% as compared to the third quarter of 2018 and 8% over year-end 2019. 12-month backlog was $7.6 billion, slightly above the third quarter of 2018 and an increase of 8% from December 31, 2019.","Additionally, the Watay transmission project in Canada recently achieved financial close and Quanta received a notice to proceed. As a result, we will include the contract value of the project in our fourth quarter backlog. We will also include a large pipeline that was signed in October and was highlighted in this morning's press release, which we believe will result in record backlog again at year end.","Our total backlog continues to expand as we capitalize on the growing infrastructure investment activity across our end markets and specifically, the longer term demand for our base business activity.","Turning to guidance, given the continued strength across our base business activities and incremental contributions from acquisitions made during the quarter, we are increasing our consolidated revenue expectations for the year to approximately $12 billion.","With regard to the Electric Power segment, we expect revenues for the year to be approximately $7.2 billion. On an annual basis, we now see aggregate Electric segment operating margin ranging from 8.3% to 8.5%, with the $79.2 million effect of the Peruvian project discussed in our second quarter earnings call negatively impacting annual operating margins by roughly 110 basis points.","Due to the uncertainty around the timing of the commencement of activities certain larger projects in Canada and associated impact on fixed costs absorption, we now expect full year margins for the electric power operations to come in slightly below double digits. However, as Duke commented, our U.S. Electric Power operations are expected to exceed 10% for 2019.","Regarding our telecommunications operations, we continue to see the opportunity for operating margins to achieve upper single digits in the fourth quarter of 2019, with our U.S. telecommunications operations leading the way with the potential to hit 10% in the fourth quarter.","We now expect pipeline and industrial segment revenues to range between $4.75 billion and $4.85 billion with full year margins between 6.2% and 6.4%. We expect our full year diluted earnings per share to range between $2.49 to $2.62 and our adjusted diluted earnings per share to range between $3.16 and $3.28.","With regard to the acquisitions made in the third quarter, their results were in line with our expectations. And we continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share contribution for the full year to be approximately $0.06. Our expectations for adjusted EBITDA, including the $79.2 million second quarter charge, now range between $904 million and $932 million.","From a cash flow perspective, due largely to reduced revenues associated with the seasonality of our work and therefore reduced working capital requirements; we expect free cash flow for the fourth quarter to range between $300 million and $400 million, resulting in full year free cash flow between $100 million and $200 million.","Due in part to slight changes in working capital expectations for the year as well as incremental cash paid for acquisitions during the quarter, we now expect interest expense for the year to range between $65 million and $66 million.","We believe our third quarter results highlight the continued strength of our end markets and our ability to profitably execute across our operations. We remain confident in our long-term prospects for profitable growth and the repeatable and sustainable nature of our core markets.","This concludes our formal presentation and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey good morning guys.","Earl Austin","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Duke, 9% margin in pipeline and industrial is the highest we've seen since I think 2014 and we know it's a seasonably strong quarter for you. You talked about the reasons why margin's higher now. but does this give you more confidence that margin in 2020 could get a lot closer to that 8% to 10% margin goal you have for that segment, given the positive mix that comes from Hallen as well? Is there anything other than weather that stands in your way for a significant step-up in that margin moving forward?","Earl Austin","Yes, thanks for the comments. When we look at the pipeline and industrial segment, I think what you've seen us, and we've been consistent over the past three years talking about strategy there to build that base business up, continue to be more repeatable and sustainable. And that's what you're seeing here, broad-based beat on the quarter. And I do think as we move forward, we'll continue to get better and continue to get up in the upper single-digit-type ranges going into next year.","So, I think it is our seasonal quarter that is high for us. We, like I said, we executed through from Stronghold all the way through our big pipe, really nice quarter. It's something for us that we continue to see this. We've seen it for a long time and our strategy that we're making the right decisions in the field from a scalability standpoint and our expansions. How far we can go will depend on the markets in the northeast with our acquisition of Hallen as well as what we do when we book big pipe in the next year. So, we'll give commentary a little deeper there when we give our 2020 guidance.","Andrew Kaplowitz","That's helpful. And then can you give us some more color on the impact of Canada and particularly California utilization on Electric Power? Kind of seems relatively self-explanatory, utilization get better as large transmission projects ramp up. But are the utilities in California pushing off work there because of how difficult the season has been? Because I would have thought that there would too much work for you there now and the growth in that region will be the highest in your businesses.","Earl Austin","So, California is our biggest state. It's extremely complicated when you start talking about that amount of resources with the fires. And first of all, our main concern is make sure the safety of our people and also make sure that we're supporting our clients in a manner that's efficient. And so when we think about it -- when you think about these resources and resource ramp-up, utilization plays a big role there.","And we're in fire areas; obviously we shut down some of the areas. We have some crew movements in the quarter. We've worked really hard with all of our clients in California to make sure we're supporting them all in this. I think this is a long-term fire hardening approach, somewhat what you've seen from the hurricanes in the southeast in California now with the fires even in the west.","So, it's not just California, it's all of us. It has drained a lot of the cross-skilled labor resources out of the country into California. It's a big place for us. We're right in the middle of it. We're supporting them across the board. The quarter was a little inefficient. I do think that will work out.","We've taken a prudent approach to guidance, but it's a long-term build there and certainly, something that we're right in the middle of it as we go forward with planning and things like that. From that standpoint, we really like the business there long-term. We're just getting through some of the strife of the season here as you see on the news.","Andrew Kaplowitz","To be clear, you're actually hiring in California, right? You can't get enough resources there. It's just all that's going on in there, correct?","Earl Austin","We're hiring across the Board. If you look at our employee count for the quarter, we're up 4,000 quarter-over-quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning and congratulations on the pipeline and industrial margins. I've been waiting for this quarter for some period of time. I guess first just to follow-up on Andy's questions on the sustainability of these margins. I think you said next year, you target or whatever, upper single-digit. I mean what are your assumptions on that in terms of is that based on stuff you have to win? And I'm trying to understand how much of the acquisition that you did in the quarter is also sort of really helping margins, or if any of this is pricing scale, so just more color there.","And then my second question also as we shift to 2020, obviously you talked about free cash flow improvement in the fourth quarter. But is there any sort of structural improvements we can think about in the cash flow as we exit 2019? Thanks.","Earl Austin","Yes, Jamie, I'll out talk about the P&L margins. And we're not in a position to give 2020 guidance at this point. But what I will say is we incrementally get better. And I do believe we can operate in the upper single-digit margins the base business alone can operate there.","So, in my mind, we continue to get better and we'll operate better. We don't know all the synergies are, but I know there synergies there an expansion in the northeast will certainly be accretive to the segment. So, when we think about it, that's how we think about it going into next year. It's too early to say how much big pipe we can book, but we have said on a consolidated basis, we can grow the company next year. And 85% to 90% of that base business over a three-year period, we think we can grow kind of mid to upper single-digit.","So, we're giving you pretty good guidance on what we see from CapEx and OpEx of our utility customers, which is the very base of the whole company. And also we'll stack on the larger projects as we have in the past. And we'll be able to formulate what I believe is extremely good guidance going into 2020. We'll do it in February. ","Derrick Jensen","Yes, Jamie, relative to the free cash flow dynamic, 2019, we had a larger growth through the year compared to our original guidance at the beginning of the year. And as you know, the dynamics of that revenue growth is draw of working capital. So that creates largest portion of fluctuation for the extent going into 2020. Duke commented about confidence in consolidated revenue growth.","To that end, I think what we see is that will have a very somewhat comparable draw of working capital historically. We run about 15% working capital trailing 12 months. You just kind of think about it going in 2020.","On the aspect of dynamics of changes, DSO put a lot of pressure here through the third quarter. I talked about that as far as some of the billing dynamics. I think it improves a little coming into fourth. In 2020, I don't think that continues to linger. I think we'll be able to see improvements in DSOs more trending towards kind of historical levels.","Jamie Cook","All righty. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Sean Eastman","Hi team. Nice quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start on the Electric Power margins. So, it looks like you guys will actually have three good-sized transmission projects all running at the same time in Canada starting in 2020. It would just be great if you could give some color on how powerful that Canada utilization uptake could be as we look out the next year. Are you able to quantify what may be the relatively low Canada utilization drag on electric is this year? Or any way to approach that kind of dynamic would be great.","Earl Austin","Sure. When we look at Canada for the quarter, even for the year, they're somewhat down off West McMurray. We knew we were booking big work in the fourth quarter. We do have some drag in inefficiency with people and equipment and utilizations in Canada for even the year.","That being said, I think with Watay and some things moving along there, it stabilizes our Canadian market for the next 24 to 36 months, which gives as an anchor to grow our base business and do some other things there. So, we really like the margin profile going into 2020 and beyond, which will stabilize Canada and be accretive to what it was at this year for sure.","And it's continually -- we continually say and I'll say it again, we'll operate in this segment double-digit margins. We will over time. We'll have some quarters, we'll have some periods where it'll be 9.7, and you'll see it bump in to 10.3. So it's going to operate in that space.","I've said it over and over and I continue to stand by the segment has over time. No matter if its large transmission, small transmission, operated in double-digits, and that's our expectation going forward.","Sean Eastman","Great. It was nice to see you guys close on solidly accretive acquisitions this quarter. Can you maybe give as an update on how the pipeline targets looks out there? Do you think we can see another Hallen [Indiscernible] transaction in the near-term? Maybe you guys prefer the buyback in the near-term, or maybe you want to pay down some leverage, any color there would be great.","Earl Austin","Sure. When we look at Hallen, it's a great company. It's been in business since 1935. We worked on that for over two years. So, that was u s and that team and that management team working together. They want to be a part of Quanta. We wanted them to be a part of us. They fit really nicely into our strategy.","I want to say that our strategy is long-term and we've been working on this strategy for three and a half years. It's not a transformation. It's certainly something that's core to us to find great companies with the right culture. We're selective in how we go about it.","Certainly, there's companies out there that fit. And as we go forward, we have a strategy. You've seen is implement it. You've seen our uses of cash. We'll be opportunistic on how we do that, both from a company standpoint. We do have some growth -- organic growth.","So, one of the things we think it's a misnomer is our company, albeit we all believe is a management team of value, it's certainly a growth company in our mind as well. We're putting it up, we're showing the growth and you'll see it over time. So, from our standpoint, we'll continue to be opportunistic with cash and look for the best way to drive shareholder value.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Noelle Dilts of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Noelle Dilts","Hi, good morning and congratulations on a nice quarter.","Earl Austin","Thank you, Noelle.","Noelle Dilts","So, my first question, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you're seeing strengthening in the midstream market. And I think you've heard more cautious views out of some of the MLPs and developers and just general concern that there might be a little more conservative of cash. So, it was encouraging to hear those remarks.","I was wondering first if you have any thoughts on sort of what you're seeing in the market versus some of that commentary and what's giving you some confidence in the 2020 outlook?","Earl Austin","So, when we look at -- first of all, midstream market, when we look at our markets and what we're doing, it's a small piece of our pipeline segments. So, I'll just say just in our areas of the Canadian markets as well as some of the basins of that we're in on the midstream side; we do see some projects moving there.","So, I think you build a lot of big pipe over the last four, five years and you will come back in. We said it all along you'll start to see midstream pick up to fill up the pipe. LNG exports and things like that going on. There's still drilling places. In our mind, you'll continue to see that midstream be there for the foreseeable future.","That being said, we still see projects. And obviously price of all of things of that nature affect drilling, there's no doubt about it. It is cyclical on the drilling side. But the pipe side there's multiple projects. The opportunities are there backing up LNG and others. So, we're optimistic that we'll book our fair share of work into big pipe as well going into next year.","And when you look at the confidence in what we're saying, we said it over and over again that we will building a repeatable, sustainable segment. And that was our strategy three and a half years ago. That's backed up by 30-year builds of what we're seeing on distribution side of cast iron, steel replacements, large things all over the big programmatic spends much larger than things you're seeing on one piece of the pipe.","And from a permitting standpoint, from a regulatory standpoint, it's certainly more efficient for us and we can certainly guide better on those areas. So, those things are really stabilizing that segment and give us confidence that we can move up from a margin standpoint as well as giving good certainty that's a repeatable, sustainable segment. ","Noelle Dilts","Thanks. That's really helpful. And then on telecom, any changes on how you're thinking about the timing of some of the opportunity here in the U.S. are the trajectory of span? I understand you're a player and there's huge opportunity to grow. But overall when you think about the market, any changes in your thinking?","Earl Austin","No, the macro market in telecom business is certainly there. We'll be smart about how we enter areas and things like that where I think we play a unique role as 5G and the small cell deployment. As it relates to the electric distribution as it comes on systems, it's more efficient for that infrastructure. It's against density to be put on distribution, electric distribution facilities, we play a unique gap -- we bridge the gap there between the carrier and the utility, which I think that looks substantial as we go forward.","And the fiber behind it, everybody's trying to get closer to the customer with data and I think you'll start to see the 5G platform as they develop technology and things that gets the platform, the infrastructure that we see today will not supportive.","So, in my mind, technology and how it is forward will drive the infrastructure build as it has in the past. So, you're going to start to see that and I think the telecommunications and where we sit there, we play and I's unique role and the macro just macro market is good. We'll be patient and systematic about it.","Like we said, we added 4,000 employees. We are really concerned that we made sure from a safety standpoint and from an execution standpoint that we execute properly in the field. And we'll pace that growth. I would expect the telecom to grow similar numbers that we have this year ex-Peru.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chad Dillard of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Chad Dillard","Hi, food morning guys.","Earl Austin","Good morning Chad.","Chad Dillard","So, I just wanted to understand the cadence in transmission business. I think ensuring volume to 2020. Just trying to think through the impact of costs absorption from Fort McMurray rolling off, but at the same time, some of the new transmission projects, large projects in Canada starting to ramp up. Just given that, I think it tends to be a more first half-weighted opportunity. How do we think about just cadence in 2020?","Earl Austin","Yes, I mean I think as I said in the past, I think the segment itself will grow. I also think it will certainly operate in double-digit margins or have the opportunity there over time. And for sure this segment will. Canada plays a big part in that. I believe if you look at the U.S. margins this year in the segment, they're double-digits.","So, Canada is somewhat of a small drag, albeit last year with Fort McMurray, it was accretive. So, when I think about it over time, Canada is more project-based. And when we come off a large project and we know we are going into another large project, which if you look at Watay and East-West Tie together, it's over $1.5 billion worth of work. So, over the next 24 to 36 months when we look at that, we will making sure we have resources and we're making sure we have the people there that are qualified to start building that.","It is somewhat the climb there allows us to work more in winter when it freezes. It's hard to predict when it does freeze. So, that being said, it will have some cyclicality from a seasonality standpoint. When you have breakups certainly in your third quarter, it's countercyclical to the segment. So, in our mind, it's very, very good for Canada to be moving forward with these larger projects.","Chad Dillard","Got it. And then just on telecoms, can you just talk about what you're seeing in the ramp on 5G fiber? Because last 12 months compared to the next 12 months will look like in terms of your revenue growth keeping all that stuff?","Earl Austin","I think 5G is a platform. As you look at that platform and what it can do, it's really -- latency goes way down. High speeds as software develops against that and other things develop against that, you'll see more and more fiber. Everyone will want to get closer to the customer. And we continue to see that and the infrastructure in place today won't support the platform.","So, what you'll see as you continue to see our carriers develop the infrastructure behind the platform and that's what we see today. How fast they do it will depend on demand and as you see people want more demand, high-speed, we certainly think the generation that people want readily available data and that will only happen with the platform and the amount of fiber in data centers and things like that are in place to get to the customer quicker. So, it will continue to move forward. I think the denser it gets into the communities and into the suburbia will only broaden out the amount of work we do.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blake Hirschman with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Blake Hirschman","Yes, good morning guys.","Earl Austin","Good morning.","Blake Hirschman","Apologies if I missed it. But is there any update to kind of call out on the situation down in Peru. Has anything really changed since the last call?","Earl Austin","So, I think we were silent by design. It's really from our standpoint; we said we believe we ring-fenced it. We're certainly in conversations with the government there. We stay in conversations. We're handing over the network as promised. We are doing everything from our standpoint to put us on the right side of that situation.","I do believe that we have not seen anything there that would change at all our position. We still feel very comfortable in what we've done there on and on the right side of the law and what our contract says. We're in very good shape.","I would say the geopolitical environment in LatAm is ever-changing. And we assess -- we continue to assess and ring fence it. The work we have there is small in nature and nothing would be material other than what we already talked about. We think we're handing over the Peruvian network like we're supposed to do.","So, we feel comfortable just we'll continue to work with the government and do the right thing there. So, we're in conversations. I would just say nothing's changed financially there in my mind or from a risk standpoint, other than we continue to derisk the segment -- that division.","Blake Hirschman","Got it. And on capital allocation, it doesn't look like you bought back any stock in the quarter and haven't really done much year-to-date either. Just curious is that due to just you're pretty close on these deals and ended up closing it in September?","Earl Austin","That's right. I mean I think its sources and uses of capital. We knew we were very close, to close in some acquisitions we thought, in our mind, we'll be accretive going forward. So that was where we chose to deploy capital. We are a couple of turns there. We're two turns. We want to delever and I think you'll see us do that over the next few quarters. Derrick, any comment?","Derrick Jensen","No, nothing.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Thalhimer","Hey Duke, can you give us a better sense for the fire hardening opportunity from the west. Big picture if you think about it in next five to 10 years, what that could mean for Quanta? ","Earl Austin","Look, I think when you look at it; it's hard to say what's going on there today. It's difficult for not only the consumer but the utilities to try to get their hands around what is expected and what's the expectation. It's an older grid. It needs to be modernized, we said that in the past and I think that remains.","The output is a large piece of our business in California. It depends on what they do if they start to turn around and things like that, it could really expand other than what it is, it's a large multiyear-type build. And as that -- I think it needs to stabilize for us to be able to predict. And it has now stabilized at all yet.","So, I think when it stabilizes, we'll know more about what to look for from a CapEx spend. But if you look at our customer base there, they've all announced large fire hardening programs in the last. It's not just California. It's your western states and that's consistent.","And when we think about it, it's a large build. I don't know how to put a number on it at this point, other than to say if you look at what's happened from a storm hardening standpoint in the south and southeast, even in the Eastern Seaboard, it's bigger than that.","Adam Thalhimer","I guess I don't understand this. When you talk about stabilization, you're talking about the stabilization of one large customer or are people still trying to figure out how to deal with the problem?","Earl Austin","I think it's you have a large customer in California that covers a lot of the state. But it's multiple states, multiple issues on fire and just in general. It's similar to what you saw with hurricanes when hurricanes came through. Its wind events, fire events. You can call it climate change, I'm not sure. But what I would say is the fires are more violent. They're causing more issues in California and in the West.","So, that being said, like you've seen on hurricanes, it's the same type of dynamic you have to go back in and take infrastructure that was put in 50, 60 years ago and modernize it for today's environment. And that -- we haven't done a lot of that in the West, so you'll start to see that as we move forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Alex Rygiel with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Rygiel","Thank you. Good morning. Nice quarter. Can you remind us what you think the free cash flow -- power of free cash flow generation is with your asset base today? And maybe if you can identify the top three uses in 2020?","Derrick Jensen","Yes, what we talked about is the growth of the base business. We continue to think that is a big driver of more repeatable, sustainable EBITDA and repeatable, sustainable cash flow.","As growth levels even at mid-single-digit on a go-forward basis on base business, at -- with those types of expectations, that would be different than just kind of double-digit growth we've had over the last several years.","We still have the opportunity for that, but when we look at about a more mid-level percentage of that growth, it gives opportunity for cash flow. I think you're looking at something along the lines of -- we talked about kind of 40% EBITDA level, 40% to 50%. The drivers of growth, we look at how we lean into growth is always the number one place we end up putting into working capital and impacts free cash flow.","CapEx, we continue to be fairly capital-intensive. This year, we're going to have CapEx around $265 million. If I look forward, I think I would tell you somewhere in the $275 million to $300 million-type level.","And then this year with the aspect of some of these delays in billing, it puts a little bit of pressure on that. I still as I said in earlier comments with Jamie, I think those will ease up a bit, and we'll be able to see DSOs trending back down to closer to historical levels. And so to that end, -- we have the opportunity to finish very strong free cash flow over time.","Pinpoint at any individual year is always challenging for us. The starts and stops of projects, seasonal dynamics most, specifically how the storm events happen particular fourth quarter is an example, can put pushes and pulls and so we want to be mindful of those fluctuations.","Alex Rygiel","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Good morning. So, these MSAs are an important part of your recurring revenues. So, I'm just curious what your funnel of new MSA agreements look like over the next few quarters for bookings opportunities. How many existing ones you have that are expiring, and how many new bids are coming up for a decision, et cetera, beyond what you have already reported for Q4.","Earl Austin","I think when look at it as part of the base business; we don't necessarily track MSAs to that level. And so when you look at it, it ebbs and flows. It just depends. Some can extend for a year, some can extend for three. It's difficult for us to pinpoint that.","What we will say is when you think about 90% of the business, a lot of that is made up of MSAs. And what we're saying there is it will go mid to upper single-digits for the foreseeable future. So, you can see that we're booking quite a bit of MSA were going forward.","We talked in the past about us, our top 20 customers there in the utility space being very sticky. And I think that remains and we're adding customers from programmatic spending and things of that nature across the Board.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And then just maybe frame what the bookings could be in Q4 from Watay and the MSA and then how much backlog was added in the third quarter from M&A.","Derrick Jensen","Yes, the M&A is roughly call it 600, 650 in total with about 400, 450 of that being kind of 12-month. And then from the standpoint of projects in the fourth quarter, we targeted in aggregate, it's over $1 billion.","Operator","Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Dudas","Good morning. Sorry about last night and thanks for squeezing me in.","Earl Austin","Well, it happens.","Michael Dudas","Just looking at going to 2020 given where your labor force stands today and again given the issues in California and shifting and moving and such, how do you feel relative to your current base of labor? What you think you might need to meet what your growth expectations are likely to be in 2020 and beyond? And is the utilization effort of that labor going to be additive to some margin improvement in both segments in 2020?","Earl Austin","I think when you look at it and when we think about it we've invested over $100 million over the past five years or so in labor and our labor force. We're very proud of that. And that's what we specialize in, this craft-skilled labor and understand the markets, we understand labor in general. And it's a collaborative approach with our trade association unions, whatever it may be.","So, I think we stood in a very nice spot to continue to access labor, train labor, get it in the field quicker, get to market quicker and be more efficient with some other things we've done with our curriculums, our colleges, things like that.","I think you'll continue to see us get more efficient on organic growth. You'll start to see it in the pipe side, the telecom side. Certainly in the power side, we continue to believe we'll operate in double-digits.","Every once in a while when you have big movements and Canadian softness there on some of those larger projects, and we're sitting on some labor, we're a little inefficient, but over time, I think that's the right way to look at it.","And if you look at double-digit kind of margins and the margin profile with the growth behind it, it's certainly something that we think we're doing a really nice job of it. It's very core to our strategy moving forward. And you continue to see us evolve and get better there on a daily basis. So, I like where we're at. I like what we're doing. And I think we'll only get better as we move into the next three to five years.","Michael Dudas","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bill Newby with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Newby","Thanks and good morning. Congrats again on a great quarter guys.","Earl Austin","Thanks.","Bill Newby","Just a couple more follow-ups on the pipeline business. I mean really good growth there, especially relative to what you guys were alluding to earlier this year. I mean, Duke, you noted the areas of strength. But I guess relative to what you guys were seeing three months ago, where's the biggest variances in the activity levels that you're seeing?","Earl Austin","Look again I think from our standpoint, our utility business in that area has certainly exceeded our expectations from our standpoint, from a broad-based beat there. We did really well with the whole segment. We did execute well in some pipe. Those projects were certainly -- have contingencies in. We worked through some of that in the quarter; it was a nice broad-based beat.","And I think going forward we continue to see that base business both from an industrial standpoint, our distribution standpoint, continue to evolve, continue to enhance our margins, to stabilize it, and restack on large projects, which we'll talk about in February.","So, we really like the seven. It's been a long-term strategy. I'm really proud of what we've done there. It wasn't easy. We certainly were hard at it. And our guys in the field and leadership should really be commended, because it's coming together and we really like what we see.","Bill Newby","Great. And then I guess as you get in the fourth quarter here on Stronghold, what are you seeing in turnaround activity? Activity in the Gulf, I think there's a pretty tough comp relative to last year. So, any thoughts there?","Earl Austin","I think when you look at Stronghold; they're doing very, very well in what they're doing. Obviously, some of the quarterly dynamics quarter-over-quarter are there. We like where they sit. We think they're doing a nice job. Some consolidation going on within that space, but very accretive to the margin profile, doing very well and quarter-over-quarter honestly, not really looking at it from that standpoint. Long-term on a yearly basis, they exceed our expectations.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'll turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Earl Austin","First, I'd like to say the California's strife there and the fires there for our people and the people that's affected; we certainly stand behind them and our customers. It's not an easy place to be. So, we want to make sure that we help them and collaborate with our customers there.","And for all the people, 46,000-plus that are in the field, we want to commend them on the safety and things they're doing to make this company great. It's their company as well, so we want to commend them.","And thank you all for participating in our third quarter conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call.","Operator","Thank you. Today's call has concluded.

Jim?","James F. O'Neil","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta Services third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Before I begin the call, on behalf of the Quanta management team, we would like to express our concerns to our friends, analysts and shareholders that may have been impacted by Hurricane Sandy, many of whom may not be able to participate on the call today. You are in our thoughts and prayers.","After my operational overview, I will turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our third quarter financial results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","We continue to see market momentum in our infrastructure segments, particularly our electric transmission and pipeline services. In addition, because of the many nuances in building major infrastructure projects in today's challenging environment, our customers have become more selective in choosing a construction partner that can successfully manage safety and environmental concerns, project timelines and execution while meeting budget expectations.","Our third quarter performance reflects our customers' continued confidence in our ability to exceed expectations with consistent, safe and efficient execution. We are also -- we also expect strong demand for our services in the future from a broadening customer base as our infrastructure projects move forward.","Our revenues in the third quarter were a record $1.69 billion, a 35% increase compared to the third quarter of 2011, and revenues for the first 9 months of this year have increased almost 49% compared to the same period last year. Our 12-month backlog is at record levels.","Our employee count at the end of this year's third quarter was approximately 21,000, up 21% compared to the third quarter of last year and up 20% since the end of 2011.","Although emergency restoration service revenues were $81 million for the quarter, the highest quarterly level since Hurricane Rita hit the Gulf Coast in the third quarter of 2008, the quarter-over-quarter increase of $16 million was negligible relative to the overall revenue growth in the quarter.","Our third quarter results were primarily driven by a strong performance in our Electric Power segment due to the significant volume of electric transmission projects underway and our ability to safely execute those projects. Improved performance quarter-over-quarter and sequentially from our Natural Gas and Pipeline and Telecommunications segments also contributed to the strong results.","Our Electric Power segment revenues continue to reflect significant growth, and 12-month backlog grew due to new contract awards.","During the third quarter, Quanta was selected for 3 large electric transmission projects which have an aggregate value of approximately $400 million. We secured a contract from ATCO Electric to install transmission infrastructure for their Hanna Region Transmission Development Project in Southeast Alberta, Canada. This project is in the early stages of construction and is expected to be completed in 2013.","Southern California Edison or SCE selected Quanta to install transmission infrastructure for SCE's Eldorado-Ivanpah Transmission Project. This project is in construction, with completion estimated by July of 2013. In addition, SCE selected Quanta to construct its Red Bluff Substation Project, which also includes the installation of 2 parallel transmission line segments in eastern Riverside County California. This project is in construction and is expected to be completed by the end of 2013.","Quanta was also selected by American Electric Power or AEP to rebuild 66 miles of its 345-kilovolt line near Corpus Christi, Texas. We will perform this work while the line is in an energized state utilizing proprietary energized services capabilities and equipment to avoid service outages to AEP's customers during construction. This project is the first of 5 phases of energized transmission upgrades AEP has planned in this area which are projected for completion by March of 2016. Once completed, this first phase will represent the longest transmission line in the United States rebuilt in an energized state. And we believe we are well-positioned to be awarded the remaining 4 phases of this project.","Our proprietary Energized Services strategically differentiate Quanta from others, enabling us to provide solutions to utilities that minimize disruption to their customers when upgrading or replacing electrical infrastructure.","Last month, a Federal court entered an order finding that a product line sold by another company infringed on the United States patent for our LineMaster Robotic Arm. We will continue to be diligent in defending our proprietary technologies and work methods.","The outlook for electric transmission spending remains strong. We continue to see a significant amount of additional new, large transmission program opportunities that we expect to be awarded over the next 12 months. In addition, smaller transmission project activity, which represents approximately 50% of our overall transmission revenues, is significant as our customers upgrade existing transmission infrastructure to comply with NERC reliability standards.","Our electric distribution revenues continue to grow at near double-digit rates through the first 9 months of this year compared to the same period last year despite political and economic uncertainty. Pockets of distribution activity are being spurred by a pick-up in new home construction, but the primary driver of distribution activity continues to be reliability initiatives.","Our Renewables revenues increased approximately 104% to $306 million during the first 9 months of this year compared to the same period of last year, as we continued to build utility scale solar projects primarily in the Western United States. We have an active pipeline of utility scale solar opportunities that we anticipate will be awarded and move into construction in 2013.","Over the past week, we have deployed significant resources to 9 states and the District of Columbia for 8 utility customers to restore electrical infrastructure damaged by Hurricane Sandy. A storm like Sandy will obviously generate emergency restoration revenues for Quanta, however, these revenues are not all incremental. Our employees who are responding from points throughout the United States and Canada have been released from noncritical work where they were generating revenues to respond to this storm event.","Additionally, we have pipeline construction projects in the Marcellus, several large electric transmission construction projects in the Northeast and our Fiber Optic Licensing business in Philadelphia that may be negatively impacted by Hurricane Sandy. As a result, it is too early to determine the extent to which Hurricane Sandy will affect our financial performance this quarter, and our fourth quarter guidance does not take into account any positive or negative impacts from the storm.","Turning to our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment, revenues increased substantially compared to the same quarter last year and more importantly, operating income continues to improve. The strategic shift of this segment over the past 18 months to capitalize on shale infrastructure opportunities, as well as better project execution, is driving this improved profitability. We expect this segment to remain profitable for the remainder of the year and for 2013.","Demand for our pipeline shale gathering services is active and steady as the lack of gathering infrastructure in many of the shales remains a challenge for producers to transport product to market and processing areas. Most of our shale gathering work is being performed in the Marcellus, Bakken and Eagle Ford Shales. We believe demand for the shale gathering infrastructure will remain robust for the foreseeable future and that development of new shales in the future will create additional opportunities for Quanta over the next several years.","We continue to see signs that a significant volume of long-haul, large diameter pipeline projects could be awarded over the next several quarters and move into construction toward the middle of 2013.","A significant increase in the long-haul pipeline market, coupled with continued demand for shale gathering pipeline construction resources, could result in a significant tightening of industry capacity. A number of long-haul pipeline construction companies have moved pipeline construction resources into the shales to perform pipeline gathering work, and we do not believe all of these spread resources will return to the long-haul market.","We have been taking strategic steps to ensure we are in position to capitalize on the return of the long-haul pipeline market when it occurs while maintaining pipeline construction resources in the shales to help our customers develop pipeline-gathering infrastructure. We will continue to gain more clarity on the progress of long haul projects and the industry dynamics over the next few quarters.","We are optimistic that long-haul pipeline market conditions should improve in 2013 and 2014.","Our Telecommunications segment experienced solid growth in the third quarter. Revenues increased almost 21% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, driven by increases in the pace of construction on broadband stimulus projects in fiber-to-the-cell site initiatives.","Our 12-month backlog increased in the quarter, while total backlog decreased slightly due to backlog burn associated with the significant increase in projects under construction during this year's third quarter, as well as the expiration of several multiyear master service agreements at the end of this year that we are optimistic will renew before year-end.","We expect broadband stimulus projects to continue through the rest of this year and well into 2013 and expect sustained high levels of fiber-to-the-cell site activity through 2013.","The reallocation of funds within the Universal Services Fund to develop and operate the broadband networks in underserved areas of the country should also have a positive impact on our business. This program funding reallocation is in the early stages of deployment, and we anticipate that our Telecom segment will begin to experience the benefits of it in the latter part of 2013 or 2014.","In our Fiber Optic Licensing segment, revenues for the quarter were slightly up compared to the third quarter of last year. This segment continues to provide a steadily growing revenue and earnings profile with attractive margins and returns. Our contract sales for this segment for the first 9 months of the year have increased at a healthy double-digit growth rate, which indicates that the segment revenue growth is likely to accelerate next year.","We are increasing our full year outlook to reflect our strong results for the first 9 months of 2012, the expectation of continued strength in all of our segments for the remainder of this year, and better visibility in our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment. Derrick will provide additional detail about our outlook during his comments.","In summary, the demand for the services Quanta provides is substantial. All of our operating segments are executing well, and total company backlog remains strong. Based on the work we have in hand today, the opportunities we believe could materialize over the next year and our confidence in continued solid execution, we believe all of our operating segments will have a solid finish to 2012, and we look forward to a strong 2013.","I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his financial review of the third quarter. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.69 billion for the third quarter of 2012 compared to $1.25 billion in the prior year's third quarter, reflecting growth of about 35% quarter-over-quarter. Net income attributable to common stock for the quarter was $96.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share as compared to net income of $52 million or $0.25 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year.","Included in net income attributable to common stock for the third quarter of 2012 is $7.1 million of income or net benefit of $0.03 per diluted share, primarily from the release of income tax contingencies associated with the expiration of certain statutory periods that are no longer subject to audit.","The growth in consolidated revenues in the third quarter of 2012 was driven by growth across all of Quanta's segments, as well as the incremental contribution of approximately $62 million in revenues from companies acquired since the third quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of revenues from acquired companies, organic growth for the quarter was 31%.","Our consolidated gross margin increased to 16.6% in the third quarter of 2012 from 15.6% in 3Q '11. This increase was due to strong performance in each of our segments, as well as the impact of higher revenues, which improved our ability to cover fixed operating costs.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were $124.3 million, reflecting the increase of $31.9 million as compared to last year's third quarter. This increase is primarily due to $16.7 million on higher salary and incentive compensation costs associated with increased levels of activity and profitability; approximately $5.1 million in increased professional fees, primarily associated with ongoing technology development costs, business development initiatives and legal matters; and $4.6 million in additional administrative expenses associated with recently acquired companies.","As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses remained flat at 7.4% for the third quarter of 2012 and 2011.","Our consolidated operating margins before amortization expense increased from 8.2% in 3Q '11 to 9.3% in 3Q '12.","Amortization of intangible assets increased from $8.3 million in 3Q '11 to $10.5 million in the third quarter of 2012 due to acquisitions at the end of 2011 and the first and second quarters of 2012.","To further discuss our segment results, the Electric Power segment's revenues were up about $266.6 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 32%. Revenues were positively impacted by higher revenues from Electric Power transmission services, resulting from an increase in number and size of projects that were ongoing in 3Q '12 compared to 3Q '11, as well as increased renewables revenues.","The increase in revenues is also attributable in part to the incremental contribution of $53 million in segment revenues from acquired companies and an increase of $13 million in emergency restoration services versus 3Q '11.","Growth in this segment without revenues from acquired companies was still 27%.","At the end of the third quarter, 12-month backlog for the Electric Power segment increased 23%, and total backlog for this segment decreased slightly by 1% compared to the third quarter of 2011.","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment increased to 12.5% in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 12.2% in last year's third quarter, primarily due to the increased volume of revenues from services on higher-margin transmission projects. Also contributing to the increase was the increase in emergency restoration service revenues which typically carry higher margins.","Natural Gas and Pipeline revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by 53% to $397.5 million in 3Q '12, primarily due to an increase in the number of shale gathering system projects currently under construction.","Additionally, we saw increases in revenues from natural gas distribution services as the outsourced gas distribution work for Puget Sound Energy was just starting up in the third quarter of 2011.","At the end of the third quarter of 2012, 12-month and total backlog for this segment increased about 26% and 11%, respectively, compared to the end of the third quarter of 2011.","Operating income for the Natural Gas and Pipeline segment as a percentage of revenues increased to 5.8% for 3Q '12 from a negative 1.6% for 3Q '11, due primarily to the impact that lower revenues earned in the prior year and on this segment's ability to cover fixed operating and overhead costs as our efforts to move into shale gathering system projects had just begun in the third quarter of 2011. Current year was positively impacted by the overall increase in the volume of this segment's revenues due to the shift to more shale gathering system projects.","Revenues from our Telecommunications segment increased $29.2 million or 21% to $169.9 million in 3Q '12, primarily due to an increase in the volume of work associated with stimulus-funded fiber optic network projects and higher revenues from fiber-to-cell site and wireless initiatives, resulting from higher capital spending by our customers. Compared to the end of last year's third quarter, 12-month backlog for the segment increased 6%, and total backlog decreased about 2%.","Operating margin in the Telecommunications segment was 13.1% in 3Q '12 compared to 11.3% in 3Q '11. This increase in margin is primarily due to increased demand for our services, allowing for margin expansion, as well as the impact of revenue increases on this segment's ability to cover fixed and overhead costs.","Fiber Optic Licensing segment revenues were $28.6 million, and operating margin was 49.2% in 3Q '12, which are both comparable to the third quarter of 2011. Capital expenditures for this segment have increased this year versus last year, which should drive revenue and backlog growth as network capacities license out to customers in 2013.","When calculating operating margins by segment, we do not allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization expense to our segments. Therefore, a previous discussion about operating margins by segment excludes the effects of such expenses.","Corporate and unallocated costs increased $18 million in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to 3Q '11, primarily as a result of $11 million in higher salary and incentive compensation costs associated with current levels of operating activity and $2.2 million in higher amortization expense associated with intangible assets.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share as calculated in today's press release were $0.48 for the third quarter of 2012 compared to an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.29 for 3Q '11.","Cash flow used in operations was approximately $61.3 million for the third quarter of 2012. Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from equipment sales, were about $68.7 million, resulting in approximately $130 million in negative free cash flow for the quarter. Days sales outstanding or DSOs were 91 days at September 30, 2012 versus 75 days at September 30, 2011 and 81 days at June 30, 2012.","Cash flow for the quarter was primarily impacted by increases in receivables. DSOs have increased compared to September 30, 2011 and June 30, 2012 as a result of the overall increase in Quanta's net position with its customers, which is driven by significant revenue increases on the select number of large electric transmission projects which went into construction starting this quarter. These jobs contributed approximately 5 days to Quanta's consolidated DSO calculation as of September 30, 2012. In addition, the significant storm work I spoke of earlier remains uncollected due to the timing of when the work was performed in the quarter.","Lastly, although we have invoiced the customer for the change orders associated with the Sunrise project, the change orders have not yet been settled due to the substantial volume of underlying support records that are being reviewed by the customer. These change orders remain and cost in excess of billings [ph] and contribute to the overall higher DSO. Detailed discussions and reviews continue with the customer, and we are currently aren't aware of any circumstances warranting any adjustments to the amounts invoiced, although the timing of the settlement could significantly impact our overall free cash flow for the year.","EBITA for the quarter of 2012 was $152.8 million or 9.1% of revenues compared to $98.1 million or 7.8% of revenues for the third quarter of 2011. Adjusted EBITDA was $193.7 million or 11.5% of revenues for the third quarter of 2012 compared to $133 million or 10.6% of revenues for the third quarter of 2011.","Calculation of the EBITA and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, all non-GAAP measures and the definitions of these and DSOs, can be found in Investors & Media section of our website at quantaservices.com.","At September 30, 2012, we had about $179 million in letters of credit outstanding primarily to secure our insurance program and we had borrowings of approximately $125 million outstanding under our credit facility. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $128 million in cash predominantly within foreign operations. Considering our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we had nearly $524 million of total liquidity as of September 30.","Turning to our outlook for 2012, we expect revenues for the fourth quarter of 2012 to range between $1.55 billion and $1.65 billion and diluted earnings per share to be $0.37 to $0.39 on a GAAP basis. Included in our estimate of GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2012 is a net tax benefit of approximately $0.02 per share associated with certain tax contingency releases due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations during the fourth quarter. These estimates compare to revenues of $1.51 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.32 in GAAP EPS in 4Q '11.","GAAP EPS forecast for 4Q '12 includes an estimate of $6.9 million for noncash compensation expenses and $9.1 million for amortization expenses. Including these expenses and the previously discussed net tax benefit, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter are expected to be $0.40 to $0.42, and compare to non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.41 in 4Q '11. This non-GAAP measure is calculated on the same basis as the historical calculations of adjusted diluted earnings per share presented in the release.","We are currently forecasting net income attributable to noncontrolling interest to be approximately $3 million to $3.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 and around $16 million to $16.5 million for the year.","For additional guidance, we are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate to be around 34% for the fourth quarter of 2012. The lower tax rate for the fourth quarter is primarily due to the additional tax contingency releases I previously discussed.","We expect our diluted share count to be about 213 million shares for 2012.","We expect CapEx for all of 2012 to be approximately $215 million to $225 million, which includes CapEx for our Fiber Optic Licensing segment of about $45 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2011 of $172 million.","As Jim commented, we continue to execute within all of our segments and we believe that we are operationally and financially well-positioned for continued solid growth in 2012 and beyond.","This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First question is, you've had -- you're having such a strong finish to the year. As you look into 2013, Jim, what do you see as your key challenges for growth?","James F. O'Neil","Well, Tahira, right now, we're seeing so much momentum. I think it's just -- getting resources is becoming more challenging, even though we are the preferred employer in the industry because we pay the best wage and provide our folks with good equipment to work with. So I think that would be the biggest challenge. I mean, we have momentum in our business. Going forward, the timing of projects is the challenge and the regulatory environment, while it's not as big an issue for us overall because we have so many projects going, trying to determine when a project is going to start, if there's a slippage of a month or 2, it could impact our forecast. But other than that, we're continuing to see momentum going into next year.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And I'll have one more, and then I'll hop back in the queue. If you look on the electric transmission side and we've tallied up several fairly large awards that are still out there, and you're talking about $200 million to $500 million type of projects, from what we can see, that could be awarded over the next 12 months. As you look at that prospect list you kind of mentioned, could you sort of talk a little more about -- provide us a little more color on the drivers of some of these transmission opportunities that you're seeing?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean, there's going to be big project awards, there are big projects in the pipeline, and we're excited about that. But I think one thing that's really not understood is the small transmission market. The regulation that's driving the NERC compliance standards and the coal switching to natural gas, these are all going to be smaller segments of transmission, and that business is very, very active and is going to remain very active, and I believe in a growth mode for quite some time. You look at CREZ, I mean, CREZ is built. It's a big transmission project but you have to think about all the laterals and interconnects that are going to be built off of that. And in total, the amount of money being spent there is far more than what CREZ is. So the small transmission market for projects that we don't typically announce with a day-to-day work is very active, and that's over half of our business. And we expect the big transmission market to be active as well. So it's a really robust time in the transmission business, and I still think we're in the early years of a major transmission buildout.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer of BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","First, Derrick or Jim, can you help me to think about -- your Q4 revenue guidance is up single digits, but your total 12-month backlog, up about 19% in Q3. What's the relationship between 12-month backlog and then revenue over the next couple of quarters?","Derrick A. Jensen","12-month backlog, overall, I mean, over the next couple of quarters, typically we would just run it about the 65% range as far as backlog as a percentage of revenue, as that relates to '12 and going into '13.","James F. O'Neil","I think the relationship, too, Adam, when you look at the fourth quarter -- I mean, first off, 12-month backlog is the best indicator of our business going forward. It's at record levels, it's strong. So that's an indicator that the next 12 months, we should see growth in our business, although we're not willing to quantify it right now. The fourth quarter guidance, we've got seasonality in the fourth quarter, we've got weather risks, the risk that projects will get pushed into the next period, we've got holidays, we've got this storm going on right now. So we think we can do better, but we're going to shoot the ball down the middle right now and give the guidance that we have. And hopefully we will do better, but we don't want to take a risk because of all of these factors and the fourth quarter being seasonal, primarily because of weather and holidays, that we have an issue hitting guidance.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, that's good. And then, for the second question, I wanted to ask about electric distribution. Jim, have you seen any -- has there been any changes there in demand in Q3? Some of the equipment suppliers saw some deceleration in demand on the distribution side, and utility returns maybe are softening a little bit. Are you seeing any utilities kind of cut distribution here?","James F. O'Neil","No, we haven't. From a comp standpoint, the third quarter in distribution was probably a tough comp at [ph] third quarter '11, but I mean, we're still seeing close to double-digit growth for the year. And really, we haven't seen any slowdown as many of the utilities are spending money on reliability. And that trend continues despite that we're in an election year. So we've been pleased with what we've seen so far, and we expect that trend to continue going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel of FBR.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Two quick questions. First, you mentioned in your opening remarks that you're seeing your customer base broaden. And one of the strengths of Quanta through the years has been that your customer base had already been very broad. Can you comment a little bit further on that comment in your opening remarks?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, well, I don\u2019t want to give any names, Alex. I mean, I think that the current environment is, for our customers, that they're under more pressure to get projects done on time and underbudget or on budget, and it's very important. And we had more discussions with people that we haven't traditionally worked with in the past, and we believe that there will be opportunities that we'll execute on because we have the capabilities to get their projects done, on time and on budget. And we have the resources to do that. You will see some new customers for certain in '13.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Excellent. And then secondly, can we dig a little bit deeper into the pipeline business, excellent quarter, 5.8% operating margin, up nicely from the second quarter. Can you put that into perspective and maybe give us some directional guidance on the mix of long-haul, large diameter versus shale work this year, and possibly, what that mix could look like next year and how it could help or hurt margins?","James F. O'Neil","I would say that for '12, all of our work was shale-related, and we've done very well. I mean, we established a presence about 18 months ago, and from that point, we've built momentum. And we've gotten more volume and better margins because of that. I wouldn't think that a 50-50 mix next year would be out of the question. But that's not going to be 1 plus 1 equal 2, so we're going to have to probably be 1 plus 1 equal 1.5. But we will have some big pipe opportunities next year, and it could be a 50-50 mix potentially, big pipe versus shale work.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Will Gabrielski of Lazard.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Can you talk about any impact you may have seen as the quarter, Q3, went along in the shales? Did you see any change in activity levels based on what's happening with the rig count or some of the commentary from the EMPs around expensing their or exhausting their capital budgets for this year and maybe waiting until next year to start spending again?","James F. O'Neil","No, Will, we haven't seen that. I mean, these EMP guys that we're dealing with, they're not going to shut rigs down for a quarter and then start back up in January. That's inefficient. I mean, we continue to see the drilling rig count on, particularly on the horizontal rigs in the liquid-rich plays, the count continues to be strong, and we haven't seen any pullback in that activity.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then for my follow-up I was just wondering if you could talk about the reliability side of your business, mostly on transmission. I've tried to ask this every quarter just to see how it's tracking, but the enforcement of some of the NERC reliability rules and how that's trending and what the margins are looking like in that work right now?","James F. O'Neil","Well, it's 50% of our transmission business, and it's growing, if not the same, more than what our big transmission business has grown this year. It's significant, and it's going to be here for several years. And our customers are just on the very front end of spending money to comply with NERC reliability standards. And then on top of that, you've got FERC 1000, you've got -- which could impact us in '14 and '15; you've got the coal switching to natural gas projects, which is going to be 30, 60-mile type segment lines that need to be built off of new gas-fired generation that's going to be in the small transmission categories. So we've got a significant amount of opportunities in the small transmission market that's being driven by regulation. And that's going to help pipeline, too, because you're going to have to build gas pipelines, compressor stations, pump stations and all that, so that's going to really support our pipeline business as well. So it's all good stuff, good drivers right now in our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noelle Dilts of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I was hoping you could speak a little bit about the opportunities that you're seeing in Canada in terms of both electrical and pipeline and how that compares to the U.S. And I've been hearing that -- we're on the pipeline side, in particular, have been hearing that labor is tight in Canada, so I'm wondering if you're seeing a shift toward negotiation and away from competitive bid in the Canadian market on the pipeline side.","James F. O'Neil","I can just tell you that the same drivers in the U.S. are in Canada today as far as both electric transmission and on pipeline. And it's a very active market, and we're well positioned in Canada from a competitive standpoint to take advantage of those opportunities as they present themselves. Really in almost every province in Canada, there's opportunities. It's the same progress that we see in the U.S. It's just about 18 months behind the activity here in the States.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then on the labor side, is there -- is the tightness in labor pools similar to the U.S. or is it a little bit tighter in Canada on pipeline?","James F. O'Neil","I would say it's as tight or if not, tighter in Canada than it is in the U.S. So everyone's going through a skilled labor, both the pipeline industry and the electric industry are going through labor shortfalls right now as the demand continues to increase for the services our customers need.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann of Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to just kind of dig into the pricing environment in the electric business specifically and there's a fairly large project that went out this past quarter that -- your name had been circled around. There's probably -- you guys have been kind of a higher quality service provider, and this is a project that I assume that you didn't want to price it at some of those levels that we're seeing in it. Can you just talk about the level of competition on price today, and what maybe your passing on that job means for the rest of the environment that you might be looking at in terms of other projects?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, Andy, you can't take one project and think that, that's going to set pricing for the industry. I mean, it's a very regional dynamic and it also depends upon the size of the line, the scope of the line, what geography, what type of geography we're in. So we're not going to win every job. I'll tell you that our philosophy on pricing hasn't changed, if anything, prices should go up because the demand for our services continues to increase. So I wouldn't read anything into us winning -- not winning a project that everybody had circled for us to win. I just think that you can't do that. The pricing dynamic in the industry still continues to be very strong.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just maybe totally different, but I guess somewhat related also. On the margins, were there any project closeouts in the quarter, Derrick or -- and can you also just quantify the absolute dollars of storm? I know you said $11 million or $16 million more this year than last, but can you just give us the absolute dollar amount for storm?","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure. The absolute dollar amount for storm for the consolidated basis is about $81 million for the quarter. And then relative to your question about closeouts, I mean, we obviously have starts and stops of all the jobs, but there was nothing material associated with any impacts for the quarter forward for those starts and stops.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine of JPMorgan.","Rodney C. Clayton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Rodney Clayton here for Scott. First, I want to ask about your Energized Services offering, obviously, you've got a nice award there from AEP, and certainly it looks like that's a service where you have a competitive advantage and what differentiates you from your competition. What's really stopping, I guess, the greater -- the percentage of your customers from adopting this type of approach when they're planning projects, is it just price or is there some other reason why that couldn't become a greater percentage of your business?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I think that Energized Services is going to be more important to our customers going forward. The NERC compliance work is going to be an important driver for that business. When you have 1 transmission line into an area that needs to be upgraded because it's not in compliance and that the customer can't or it's not cost effective to acquire a new right-of-way or take the line out of service because the customers will have interruptions for too long of a period of time, so this is a perfect application in technology that becomes cost-effective at that point to utilize. That's why AEP is using this technology. So again, upgrading this older infrastructure having 1 line in and out of the load center, it gets to the point of right-of-way issues and everything else. It just makes it a lot more cost effective and more efficient for the customer to use this technology going forward. So we're pretty excited about the opportunities we have for Energized Services in the future.","Rodney C. Clayton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, got it. Very good. And I guess one more follow-up. I want to ask about Howard Energy Partners, just in general, how is that venture going, and how does your project pipeline look as you get to work in the Eagle Ford shale?","James F. O'Neil","Howard Energy is going along like we expected it to. The investment is giving us opportunities. The Eagle Ford is very early in development. And we are seeing engineering and construction opportunities, not only in the Eagle Ford, but in other areas because we've leveraged our relationship with Howard to do work in the Marcellus as well and in the Bakken. So we've been very pleased with that relationship and that investment, and we expect more opportunities to come out in the future as the Eagle Ford, in particular, becomes more active.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Zach Larkin of Stephens Inc.","Chris Godby - Stephens Inc., Research Division","This is Chris Godby in for Zach. With 2 quarters of profitability in gas with that large diameter work, do you have a sense for what the operating margin profile of the segment could be just on shale work alone?","James F. O'Neil","Well, we've said we should be in the mid- to upper single-digit operating income on shale gathering work alone. And we've been moving toward that target over the last several quarters. If we were to bring in some big pipe into that mix, some large diameter pipe, we should be able to move into that 9% to 12% operating income range.","Chris Godby - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, thinking about electric transmission, have there been any changes in approval timelines given the regulatory environment or elections?","James F. O'Neil","No, everything has moved according to plan over the last -- since the last quarter, we haven't had any delays to speak of. Nothing meaningful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ahmar Zaman of Piper Jaffray.","Ahmar M. Zaman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","A couple of questions just on the impact of Hurricane Sandy. I know you made some comments in your prepared statements. First question is, how much pre-prep were you able to do getting -- going into Hurricane Sandy, and how will that affect kind of minimizing the damage to your activities that were in the past? And then secondly, the repair work that you'll probably get because of Hurricane Sandy, how should we think about the margin profile of that work versus your -- basically the margin mix between repair work and existing projects that were impacted by Hurricane Sandy is what I'm trying to get at.","James F. O'Neil","A hurricane is a little bit different than a tornado or an ice storm, we get a little bit of pre-notice, so we did have almost a week to prepare and batten down and secure our equipment in the core services that we provide in the area. So hopefully, we'll be okay there. I mean, we haven't been able to go in and completely assess the situation to date. We were also, at the same time, able to move a significant amount of resources in and pre-position those resources prior to the storm arriving so that we can have an expedient response to the storm damage that occurred. So in both cases, both from our core business and helping respond, too, to repair the damage, we had some ability to move in and do what we could before the storm arrived. As far as the margin profile, I don't even think we need to go there right now. I mean, certainly storm margins do come in at a higher margin, but are these resources coming off existing work we're doing for those utilities we're responding to? Are they coming in from Canada or the West Coast? And then what ultimately is the impact, negative impact, to our core business in the area? So it's just too early to tell what kind of margin impact we're going to have at this time. But certainly, by our fourth quarter call, we'll be able to give more color around that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Mannes of Avondale.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","A couple of follow-up questions. I think most of my questions have been asked and answered, but real quick on the pipeline side. We were pretty pleased to see the backlog pick up sequentially. Can you talk a little bit about maybe the bidding environment on the shale side, and maybe just help me out a little bit with understanding the seasonality of the business because it looks like it's run [ph] a lot less seasonality than maybe we've seen before?","James F. O'Neil","There is less seasonality even though I don\u2019t want to discount the fourth quarter weather seasonality. There's seasonality in the amount of work that you do, and there's seasonality due to weather. The work's steady right now. The fourth quarter is very active because our customers are still trying to get infrastructure in place and there's no let up. With that said, that means that you're really moving with one customer from project to project to project, so you're really working on a negotiated basis. They don't have time to go out and do an RFP on every project, and they certainly don\u2019t want to deal with the new foreman and workforce every time they bid out a new job. So they're very comfortable with their working relationship with us. We've been working for 6 to 8 of the same customers and just going from project to project to project, and the work is steady and we don\u2019t see any see any let up on that work going forward. If anything, it's increasing.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Sounds good. And then, just one quick other topic that you guys haven't talked much about. But you mentioned on Puget Sound, obviously you've kind of outsourced their gas LDC operations. Are you seeing opportunities either for more deals like that or alternatively, just more opportunities for gas LDC retrofit work, especially given some of the regs coming down from FIMSA [ph] there and certainly what happened in California?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, certainly, we think there are more opportunities to do outsourcing work and program management on reliability of projects that are being driven by FIMSA [ph] regulations. There are opportunities, that's one of the biggest areas I think that we have, working off a smaller base, of course, but that's one of the biggest areas of growth for us, as the integrity and the pipeline rehabilitation work that is going to occur throughout the country. There's a role to be a program manager in many of those, and certainly some outsourcing opportunities are possible.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse.","Andrew Buscaglia","This is actually Andrew Buscaglia on behalf of Jamie. Just a quick question. It's regarding your customers' visibility, I know we have -- the elections should be kind of like a lift for that. But I'm just curious what you guys are hearing. I mean, it looks like your guidance says that things are getting better for your customers, and just curious what they're saying on the remainder of the year and 2013, just any update there.","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean, our customers -- the spending is there. I mean, we've got significant pipeline of opportunities and backlog going into '13. So there doesn't seem to be any pull back from our customers on capital spending in either the electric -- or electric, pipeline or Telecommunications markets right now in our customer base. Things look to be very active going into '13.","Andrew Buscaglia","Okay. And then just an update on capital allocation relatively -- specifically, if you can comment on M&A, what your updated views are, if any?","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure. I mean, capital allocation, first, is the -- obviously, a working capital to support the business, but you can see this going on here versus the second and third quarter type of cash demands. Second, capital expenditures. And then third, to investments and acquisitions. We did about 10 acquisitions over the last year to 1.5 years now, and we've continue to be active in the -- and opportunistic in that area. As it stands right now, we don't really comment to future acquisitions and the timing of when and how large and whether they will occur. But we've continued to be active and opportunistic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Rogers of D.A. Davidson.","John Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","The -- if we could just go back to the DSOs for a second. I know that in the past, seasonally, they've come down the fourth quarter. But it sounds like there were some timing issues this quarter, and then -- can you just talk about how quickly those are going to drop back down or what the collection cycle is on those?","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure. Your -- I would agree that, I mean, typically, DSOs do decline in the fourth quarter because of the seasonality as revenues also drop. But particularly in this fourth quarter, I think it's pretty difficult. The storm work that Jim alluded to is an example. We're uncertain as to yet as to the type of volume that may occur from that and the timing of what that would be and how long. And so, that could be a pretty big draw of cash. Secondly, as I made reference to the Sunrise change order as an example, the timing of the collection of that, we're striving to achieve the collection before the end of the year, but as to whether that occurs by 12\/31 or into the following quarters, a little bit difficult to say. I would say that we, overall, expect we'll have a strong free cash flow in the near term. It's just difficult to say whether that will occur by the 12\/31 timeframe or not.","John Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just my other question was, I guess for Jim, in terms of the large diameter work, there's a lot of projects on the table. But are they going to bid this season, meaning, I guess late fourth quarter, first quarter or some of the big projects that we're seeing in the press, are they late or end 2012 or 2013, sorry?","James F. O'Neil","I think the bidding season is modified somewhat during this time. I think that you really don't have a bidding season right now. I think it's just -- it's on an ongoing basis. And it really -- you may not have projects go to a formal RFP. It may be just a negotiation process because some of these projects are so big and our customers are concerned about capacity. So I wouldn't be focused so much on a bidding season on big pipe this year. I think it's going to be a different dynamic, not to say that it won't moderate back to a bidding season at some point in time. I do think -- we do think these programs get built, whether it's in the latter part of '13, the mid of '13, the latter part of '13 or into '14, a lot of that's going to do to the regulatory environment and when these projects get approved, these liquid lines [ph] get approved. But it's going to be a very robust market. You can see the capital spending going into the refinery space, and the EMPs really aren't letting up on drilling these wells and building this gathering infrastructure. So the next logical step is to build these pipelines, and we do see visibility and traction online to getting plans [ph] moving toward construction in the -- over the next year or 2.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Gusick [ph] of Wedbush Securities.","Unknown Analyst","You mentioned earlier about an expectation for dark fiber acceleration going forward. Could you talk a bit more about that?","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure. I mean, last year, we had capital expenditures in dark fiber, of about $17 million, and this year, we have CapEx in the segment of about $45 million. And so, what we believe will happen as Jim alluded to that the pick up in sales K-12 has been a little bit down because of the economy, and that's picked back up in some of the double-digit sales that you see. And we think that will turn back into revenues in backlog in the future as we end up delivering on those networks.","Unknown Analyst","And also, it looks like you had substantial Telecom bookings in the quarter. That appears to be accelerating. Can you talk a bit more about that going forward as well?","James F. O'Neil","Yes. I mean, I think what you're seeing is that we're in the height of the stimulus buildout right now, and we think that our business will continue, the Telecom construction activity will continue at high levels through the better part of 2013. But the significant portion of what you're seeing is stimulus buildout that's occurring due to customers in underserved areas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Martin Malloy of Johnson Rice.","Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","On the pipeline side, could you talk a little bit about your market share in terms of spreads of equipment for large diameter pipelines in North America?","James F. O'Neil","Yes. I mean, I think what we've been saying is we've got about 1\/3 of industry capacity to do large diameter pipeline across the U.S. So it's about 1\/3.","Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And in terms of levels of activity, and -- do you think you can come back to the '06, '08 timeframe?","James F. O'Neil","I think it's possible. I think it depends upon how compressed a construction cycle we have, how many customers are we going to be [indiscernible] are going to be building pipe for at one time, or does it get spread over a 3 to 4-year period. It's going to be a very active market. Can it reach '08 levels? Yes, but that's yet to be determined as to whether that will happen or not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher of UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Wondering if you can talk about your staffing and presence in the various shales. Are you guys ramped up to where you want to be in the specific shales? And if not, which basins do you think you need to add the most incremental resources to be the most competitive?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I think, the Marcellus was the first shale that really was developed and we've been there for 18 months, and certainly, we're doing a lot of work there. But we've got a presence there now, so we're well-positioned to take on additional customers if we're able to do so. The same goes for the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, which are younger shales as far as development, but opportunities will present themselves there as well. And then you start talking about new shales that haven't even really been developed yet, like the Utica, the Niobrara, the Granite Wash, the Mississippi, and it goes on and on. So it's a life cycle, but we will continue to build our presence in the shale and take advantage of those opportunities. And we should see growth over the next several years, building out gathering for some work.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference over to management for some closing remarks.","James F. O'Neil","I'd like to thank you all for participating in our third quarter 2012 conference call.

Duke?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services fourth quarter and year end 2017 earnings conference call. On the call, I will provide operational and strategic commentary before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","2017 was a strong year for Quanta, and we are pleased with our strategic position in the marketplace and believe the operational and strategic investments we made last year will continue to separate Quanta in the utility, energy and communications infrastructure industries. We accomplished many of our goals in 2017, including, increasing revenue more than 23% and growing adjusted earnings per share by approximately 30%. We ended the year with record backlog in excess of $11 billion, which does not include several larger projects we previously announced last year and after the end of the fourth quarter.","We continue to lead the industry in safety, which, we believe, starts with training. In the fourth quarter, we completed our first internally developed electric power line worker pre-apprentice program class and we recently acquired Northwest Lineman College, which I will talk about in more detail shortly.","In response to several major hurricanes in 2017, we deployed thousands of line workers across six states and multiple islands in the Caribbean to support and assist multiple customers' power restoration efforts. And during all of 2017, we responded to natural disasters in another 33 states and Canada. We also established Quanta Cares, which raised more than $1.4 million through donations from employees, friends, and suppliers, and company matching to assist Quanta employees that were impacted by disasters.","We focused on positioning our base business for long-term profitable growth, as evidenced by double-digit growth in MSA revenues in 2017 over 2016, which was accomplished through new agreements, increased MSA share as well as service line expansions with many existing customers. We signed an EPC contract for the largest electric transmission project in our company's history, which further demonstrated our ability to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. Excluding this project, we estimate that our EPC backlog at the end of 2017 increased more than 25% over year in 2016 backlog.","Quanta established a market-leading presence in the downstream industrial services space through the acquisition of Stronghold, which, we believe, provides multiple platforms for future growth, including critical path industrial services and storage tank construction and maintenance.","We successfully launched our communications infrastructure services in the United States. This has been very well received by customers and resulted in booking approximately $400 million of backlog with eight customers in the U.S. in 2017. We on-boarded hundreds of employees and performed engineering and construction services on projects in 13 states.","We established first infrastructure capital and secured up to $1 billion of available capital to invest in infrastructure projects. Additionally, we began construction on two large EPC projects in which Quanta has minority investments, including the Fort McMurray West high-voltage transmission project in Alberta.","Also, Quanta executed on several strategic industry-leading training and recruiting initiatives that we believe will ensure we have access to craft skilled labor needed for future growth and to differentiate us in the marketplace. These are just some of the accomplishments in 2017 and while we are proud of these achievements, there is room for improvement.","We continue to believe there's opportunity to create significant stockholder value as we execute on our strategic initiatives, which includes returning our operating margin to historical levels. We continue to believe we're in a prolific environment across our end markets in the U.S. and that we are in the early stages of a multi-year growth cycle. Both are our Electric Power and Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment grew revenues by double digits in 2017 over 2016, and we expect continued growth in 2018. While larger projects capture the headlines and generate excitement, it is the smaller projects, maintenance and every day work that is driving much of our growth. We estimate this type of work grew 20% and accounted for more than 75% of our revenues in 2017. Looking forward, we expect this activity to remain strong.","Each of our addressable markets are large, accounting for several hundred billion dollars in aggregate annual spend. We believe each of our end markets could grow CapEx and OpEx spending at a mid-single digit compound annual growth rate over the medium-term with opportunity for double-digit growth in some periods.","For example, our top 10 electrical customers in 2017 are estimated to grow their transmission and distribution CapEx greater than 10% in the aggregate over the next two years. A majority of the annual end market spend drives the everyday work we perform and provides meaningful growth opportunity for Quanta.","Quanta has been growing, expanding and investing in craft skilled labor for two decades and with 33,000 employees at year end has the largest and we think the best workforce in our industry. We are leveraging our craft skilled labor and construction expertise with advanced solution offerings and expanding into market adjacencies that allow us to capture more of our end markets' annual spend.","For example, in 2017, we organically grew our gas distribution head count by approximately 10% and extended our gas distribution operations in two states to give us a presence in a total of 25 states. These organic expansion efforts have created short-term margin pressure, but we are confident that the margin should improve as crew productivity increases and these operations scale.","We will continue to focus on and invest in growing this recurring work across our service lines, which should provide a solid and more consistent business underpinning for the long-term, complemented by larger projects.","It is important to note that we do not operate our business to just accept what the market brings us. We continually strive to innovate our solution offering and remain well ahead of industry trends. Our success in doing so over the years has played a critical role in establishing the leadership position we have today.","We believe our scope, scale, safety record and balance sheet gives us a competitive advantage in the market and allows us to provide solutions that our end markets did not have in the past. We value the collaborative relationships we have with our customers and we'll continue to partner with them as they execute their capital deployment plans.","We also see an increase in larger projects for electric transmission and mainline pipeline over the next few years. For example, with respect to larger electric transmission projects in 2017 and early 2018, we signed contracts for AEP's Wind Catcher Generation Tie Line, which has a contract value in excess of $1 billion, but it's not yet reflected in backlog. The Ontario East-West Tie Line Project in Canada for NextBridge, and as disclosed in our earnings release this morning, in January, we signed a contract to provide comprehensive construction services for a large transmission project in South Florida.","For larger mainline pipeline projects in 2017 and early 2018, we signed a contract for two spreads of Enbridge's Line 3 Replacement Project in Canada; added the estimated value of our work on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project to our backlog; signed contracts for other large pipeline projects that we are not able to disclose due to confidentiality agreements with our customers; and earlier this month, we announced that Quanta secured three spreads of large diameter pipeline work in West Virginia for two mainline pipeline projects with an aggregate estimated contract value in excess of $550 million.","The quality of our people and our strategic focus on safety, training and being the preferred employer in our industry, coupled with our self-perform model, has earned us a reputation for safely executing projects on time and on budget. Our construction execution has allowed us to provide cost certainty to our customers and offer a self-perform EPC solution across many of our end-markets and geographies that we believe is unmatched.","As a result, the historic levels of capital and operating investments, demand for skilled labor is high and industry resources are increasingly strained. The solutions we provide are specialized, and even though we have the largest skilled workforce in the industry and the ability to expand, meeting the growing needs of our customers is challenging.","For many years, Quanta has made strategic investments in safety, training and recruiting to become increasingly self-reliant and to ensure we have a qualified workforce needed to grow our business and meet the needs of our customers. Our ongoing investment in training through Quanta's world-class training facility, our partnership and affiliations with educational and trade groups, and our other regional activity, all demonstrate our commitment to meeting the long-term needs of our customers and sets us apart in the marketplace.","To that end, this morning, we announced the acquisition of Northwest Lineman College, or NLC, which is a strategic and transformative addition to Quanta's ability to attract and train qualified craft skilled labor. NLC is an accredited college and we believe is the premier educational and training institution for pre-apprentice and apprentice line workers in the country. NLC is the largest educational and training organization that provides training across the full lifespan of a line worker's career. Their education and training expertise is scalable and should allow us to expand their operations across geographies, industries and service lines. For example, we are developing new curriculum for the natural gas distribution and communication industries, which we believe will benefit Quanta, our industry, and our customers.","Our people in the field are what makes Quanta unique. The addition of NLC, which we believe is the best education and training facility in the world, to our already industry-leading craft skilled workforce is a powerful differentiator. We believe NLC has the ability to transform Quanta's workforce and the industries we serve. We are proud to start 2018 off with this acquisition.","We are pleased with what we accomplished in 2017, but are focused on further improvement. We continue to believe that end market drivers are firmly in place and that we have the opportunity to achieve levels of record backlog this year. We expect MSAs, smaller projects and other types of work that we consider recurring in nature to continue to grow. We also see continued opportunity for the award of larger high-voltage electric transmission projects and multi-year alliance programs over the near and medium-term.","We believe the larger diameter pipeline project market is robust with a multi-year cycle ahead of us and expect our communications infrastructure services operations to grow. As a result, our guidance announced this morning reflects revenue growth and improved profitability expectations for both the Electric Power and Oil and Gas segments in 2018, and solid EPS growth.","Of note, it is the first time that the midpoint of our guidance equates to $10 billion of revenues and our adjusted earnings per share guidance range has exceeded $2, even excluding the beneficial effect of tax reform.","As we typically do at the beginning of the year, we have taken a prudent approach to the revenue and margin ranges in our guidance to reflect what we believe are possible outcomes based on the risks inherent with our business. Some of these risks are more pronounced earlier in the year, due to unpredictable weather, the timing of project starts and general customer budget releases, all of which can affect our financial results.","In addition, we're in the earlier stages of ramping construction on certain larger projects. Most notably, almost all of the increased mainline pipeline activity is not expected to begin until the second and third quarter of this year.","As the year progresses and we gain better visibility into our performance, project timing and industry dynamics, we typically adjust our guidance as needed. To the extent adjustments are warranted, ideally they're upward due to the prudently setting expectations at the outset.","We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and we'll continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset is the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for our stakeholders.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO for his review of our fourth quarter results. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced record fourth quarter revenues of $2.48 billion, a 17.9% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $113.6 million or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $88.5 million or $0.57 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.45 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.56 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Consolidated 12-month backlog at December 31, 2017 is approximately $6.4 billion and total backlog is $11.2 billion, both of which are at record levels.","Certain items impacted the fourth quarter of 2017 and reflected as adjustments in our adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation. Favorably impacting the fourth quarter of 2017 was a net tax benefit of $70.1 million or $0.44 per diluted share associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. The tax reform benefit includes $85.3 million associated with the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the lower U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 21%.","The re-measurement benefit was partially offset by an estimated $15.2 million transition tax on undistributed earnings and profits of certain foreign subsidiaries. Additionally, a net tax benefit of $18.2 million or $0.11 per diluted share was generated as a result of various Quanta-led entity restructuring and recapitalization efforts that culminated in the fourth quarter. This tax benefit offset the negative cash impact of the transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings.","The favorable tax impacts for the fourth quarter of 2017 were partially offset by the negative impact of goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $58.1 million, $36.6 million net of tax or $0.23 per diluted share, which were primarily associated with two reporting units within our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment.","The aggregate revenues of these operating \u2013 reporting units represent approximately 1% of our consolidated revenues. So, their operations are not material to our consolidated results or expectations.","To further discuss our segment results, Electric Power revenues increased 22.8% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 to $1.57 billion. This increase was primarily due to higher customer spending associated with electric transmission projects and to a lesser extent $16.9 million in additional emergency restoration services revenues.","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment increased to 9.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to 8.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher segment revenues, including a higher proportion of the larger electric transmission project revenues as well as favorable execution across our broader work.","I also want to mention that the necessary investments we are making to scale and support the growth of our communications infrastructure services operations, included within this segment, continue to have a slight negative effect on Electric Power segment margins.","Without the dilution associated with these startup efforts, the Electric Power segment operating margins would have exceeded double digits for the quarter. We believe the communications operations are at a positive tipping point and expect improved profitability in 2018.","As of December 31, 2017, 12-month backlog for the Electric Power segment was $4 billion, which is incrementally stronger from the third quarter and with an increase of 20% when compared to December 31, 2016.","Total backlog for the segment was $7.4 billion, which was also incrementally stronger and an increase of 11% when compared to 4Q 2016. These increases continue to reflect the end market drivers and opportunities that Duke referenced in his comments.","Oil and Gas segment revenues increased 10.1% quarter-over-quarter to $903.8 million in 4Q 2017. This increase was primarily due to incremental revenues from the acquisition of Stronghold partially offset by a decrease in revenues on larger pipeline transmission projects due to the timing of these projects. During 4Q 2016, we had several larger pipeline transmission projects in full construction, whereas in 4Q 2017, most larger pipeline transmission projects were nearing completion with others scheduled to begin in 2018.","Operating margin decreased to 2.1% in 4Q 2017 from 8.1% in 4Q 2016. This decrease was due to the significantly lower contribution of larger pipeline transmission revenues, lower margins on certain distribution work as crews continued to ramp on newer work, impacts from the temporary suspension or deferral of projects as a result of Hurricane Harvey, largely associated with the operations of Stronghold as well as some degree of seasonality and project performance.","As of December 31, 2017, 12-month backlog for the Oil and Gas segment was $2.4 billion, which was an increase of 5.7% when compared to September 30, 2017 and was at comparable levels to last year end's 12-month backlog. Total backlog for this segment was $3.8 billion, which was a decrease of 2.2% when compared to September 30, 2017, that represents a 23% increase from the end of last year.","Corporate and non-allocated costs increased $59.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to 4Q 2016, primarily due to the previously mentioned goodwill impairment charges. For the fourth quarter 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities were $198 million. The fourth quarter operating cash flows contributed to $372 million in total cash flows from operating activities for the year.","Net capital expenditures of approximately $221 million for the year resulted in approximately $151 million of full year free cash flow. This compares the free cash flow of approximately $200 million for the year ended 2016. The year-over-year decrease in cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations was largely due to incremental payments of $25 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the settlement of a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability, which originated in 2011.","DSOs were 76 days at year-end 2017, down from 79 days as of the third quarter, which positively contributed to the fourth quarter of 2017 cash flows. DSOs were up slightly when compared to 74 days at year-end 2016. This increase also somewhat negatively impacted annual cash flows when compared to last year and is due to timing of billing terms across various projects. The $128 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2017 allowed us to repay $88 million under our credit facility and repurchase 1.4 million shares of our common stock for approximately $50 million.","At December 31, 2017, we had $138 million in cash. We had $413 million of letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding and we had $668 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with $867 million in total liquidity as of December 31, 2017.","Turning to our guidance, for the full year 2018, consolidated revenues are expected to range between $9.75 billion and $10.25 billion. Our range of revenue guidance contemplates Electric Power segment revenues of $5.8 billion to $6 billion. These levels are driven by our expectation for continued momentum in our Electric Power and communications operations and represent growth over 2017. Of note, 2017 included record emergency restoration revenues of $265 million, as compared to our expectations of approximately $100 million of emergency restoration revenues in 2018.","In addition, our Electric Power expectations do not include construction revenues associated with the previously announced Wind Catcher and Northern Pass Transmission projects, both of which are subject to regulatory approval and would represent additional upside to our 2018 results.","As it relates to seasonality, we expect revenues in the first quarter of the year to be the lowest, ramping in the second and third quarters and then reducing in the fourth quarter. Quarter-over-quarter growth could be between 10% and 20% for the first and second quarters, with quarter-over-quarter growth rates moderating through the third and fourth quarter.","We expect the high end of our revenue range to offer opportunity principally during the latter part of the year, potentially resulting in greater revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters relative to 2017. We see 2018 operating margins for the Electric Power segment increasing compared to 2017 and to be between 9.25% and 9.8%.","We expect the seasonal effect on margins will be comparable to 2017 with first quarter operating margins of approximately 8%, growing to exceed 10% in the third and fourth quarters. Although the high end of our full year Electric Power operating margin expectations contemplate double-digit margins, our communications operations continue to ramp, slightly diluting margins in the segment. However, we believe communications operating income margins could reach upper-single-digits by the end of the year.","The high end of our revenue range contemplates Oil and Gas revenues growing at roughly 10% relative to 2017. The year-over-year growth in Oil and Gas revenues is partially attributable to a full year contribution from Stronghold, which we continue to expect will contribute between $575 million and $600 million in segment revenues.","As to seasonality for the Oil and Gas segment, due to the timing of projects, the first quarter may have revenues as low as $700 million, which would pressure margins in a similar manner as the fourth quarter of 2017, potentially yielding margins in the 1% to 2% range. However, revenues and margins are expected to ramp into the second and third quarters, with third quarter revenues increasing as much as 25% as compared to the third quarter of 2017. Similar to Electric Power, revenues and margins are expected to decline into the fourth quarter. Overall, Oil and Gas segment operating margins are expected to improve over 2017 and be between 5.7% and 6.7%.","We anticipate interest expense for the year to be approximately $23 million for 2018. Two areas that have significant variability in the 2018 financial models within the investment community are other income and expense and income taxes. In prior earnings calls and other venues last year, you may recall our commentary that the other expense line item would increase in 2017 and increase further in 2018, partly due to the ramp-up in construction activity on projects in which we have investments.","Recall that our investments require us to defer a portion of the construction activity. Currently, our forecast for 2018 for other expense is approximately $20 million to $30 million, a portion of which relates to these deferrals. We are currently projecting our effective tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 29% for the year, with the first quarter rate being as low as 26% due to the tax effects of stock-based compensation, a majority of which impacts the first quarter. We anticipate our non-controlling interest deductions should be between $2 million to $3 million for the year.","For purposes of calculated diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended 2018, we are assuming around 159.3 million weighted shares outstanding. We anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the year to be between $1.95 and $2.35 and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $2.40 to $2.80. Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share presented in our release.","We closed two transactions during the first quarter of 2018. The results of these transactions are included in our guidance. However, there are acquisition and integration costs associated with these transactions, approximately $6.1 million of which will impact the first quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share expectations.","Our full year 2018 guidance reflects foreign exchange rates comparable to 2017. Fluctuations of foreign exchange rates could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and could cause actual financial results to differ from guidance.","Reflecting on 2017, we ended the year with record fourth quarter revenues, record annual revenues and record revenues for each segment. We generated record emergency restoration service revenues of $265 million. We supported this growth in demand on working capital by extending the maturity of our credit facility during the year while deploying $361 million for acquisitions and $50 million for share repurchases and supporting various of our project investments.","We ended the year achieving a debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.3, which we believe is prudent in order to support the working capital demands of our growing business, while allowing us to continue to pursue opportunistic deployments of capital to acquisitions, investments and share repurchases. We have record 12-month and total backlog and we believe that we are operationally and financially well positioned for continued profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.","This concludes our formal presentation and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","First of all, congratulations on a solid outlook, Duke and team.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thank you, Tahira.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Duke, your namesake utility came out with a pretty solid budget the other day. They're upping distribution spending by 40% year-on-year. And if you look at the three-year plan, transmission is going up. Seems like you've got a project in the Southeast. Can you shed some light? That's an area we haven't seen much apart from storm restoration sort of resilience work in the past. Is there anything new going on there that's bringing that area to live on some of the electric T&D work?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, Tahira. Again, I think we talk a lot about the CapEx and OpEx budgets of our utility customers, which we think is really what drives the very basis of the Electric Power and Gas segment for that matter. When we talk about the 75% of our base business, that's what we're talking about. We hear a lot about when a communication customer grows their budgets and things of that nature about the growth, but that's \u2013 the same thing on the power side is going on. We're not hearing a lot about it. Duke was one of them that came out and talked about what's going on from a CapEx and OpEx standpoint. So yes, we support all those customers and it's growing quite nicely underneath, and it's underpinning what you're seeing and why we're so bullish about the macro demand of the Electric Power and Gas markets. We continue to talk about it over and over and over again about the growth. And so that's what you're seeing in the Electric Power business, and it's going to sustain for the medium-term as far as we see it.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it, Duke. And the second question is about the training school. Last day, on your Analyst Day, you talked a lot about training and it's been something that's showing up more in your commentary. With the acquisition of the school, is it going to help you remain competitive on the pricing side? Is it going to give you more leeway regionally? Would love to get an idea of strategically how this helps you either maintain your market share or gain market share.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, I think it's unique. We bought a accredited college, I wouldn't call it a school. So when you think about it, it's something that adds to what we already have, which is world-class skilled labor, and what we think is the very core of who we are is putting that world-class skilled labor out, and having cost certainty and then adding the advanced solutions around that craft skilled labor.","What Northwest Line does for us is it takes the academia pieces of that and it puts it into all of our training across all of Quanta, as well as what we're doing for the industry when we recruit, when we train new apprentices. It just allows us to expedite what we're trying to accomplish with boots on the ground labor in the field. And it makes us look, feel different and also helps the industry and our clients, because they have the same issues we have.","For 15 years or so, North America has not trained craft skilled labor. It's almost been a dirty word. We've got in front of that about five years ago with the Lazy Q facility. This academia piece, which I believe is world-class, the best training guys in the country and our business and we'll take that and ramp it into gas, telecom, and whatever other verticals that we come up with to put in the craft skilled labor. It'll enhance who we are. It'll enhance how quickly we can deploy resources in the field and grow organically. So we're very proud of the acquisition. It's certainly a solution-based acquisition that's going to help Quanta and the industry.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Duke.","Operator","Our next question is from Noelle Dilts with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Noelle Christine Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, everyone, good morning.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Noelle Christine Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So just starting off, it sounds like the large diameter pipeline market is overall picking up and accelerating. I understand you're really focused on emphasizing small and medium market as well and not picking up. So if you can just give us some thoughts on now that, overall the pipeline market, both small and medium and large seems to be picking up. How just the competitive environment is looking? What you're seeing in terms of pricing and terms on some of these contracts? And then, can you also give us an update on the Canadian market and how you're thinking about the outlook there as it relates to activity?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, Noelle. The large diameter pipeline market we talked about being at capacity in 2018 and we still think that that's the case as far as North America goes. As far as pricing and such, I mean, most of these projects are long-term projects. We've negotiated many of them years ago with the way escalation and things like that work. So we're happy with the contracts that we have. We continue to see a robust market there out past 2018, continue to see RFPs, RFQs; it's all over the place as far as negotiations, alliances and the way the contracts are looking. Obviously, we price the risk. We talk about the markets with our clients, but continue to support their CapEx bids on large pipe. The LNG markets are exporting as well. So that looks good for us.","As far as Canada goes, I think you need export there from the LNG on coastlines with gas or oil. If that does not happen, you're going to see the export market in the U.S. get more robust. And so you'll see more pipes to support LNG in the state. So one of the other is going to happen. We are seeing a pick-up on the small diameter pipe in the markets in Canada, which is good. And so we're optimistic on that.","Noelle Christine Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And then just shifting over to T&D, the South Florida project that you announced, can you clarify if that's an independent project or if it's related to some of the rebuild work following the hurricane? And then if you could talk about that longer-term opportunity that you're seeing in South Florida and even Puerto Rico around rebuild work?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, Florida, our customers in Florida, there's tremendous amount of grid modernization going on down there and they did a really nice job with the hurricane. We picked it up quite nicely in Florida. So the job itself was not \u2013 it was an independent job, when we announced....","Noelle Christine Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","...typically over $100 million, so that's typical when we announce a job, that job was independent of that just to show the breadth of there is some large projects out there that kind of don't make the headlines every day that we are picking up. But in general I would say the Florida market and what's going on there is robust. As far as Puerto Rico, there's a lot of rebuild going on down there. We've looked at it multiple times. I would just say that for us it was extremely important to support our ongoing customer base and it was necessary for us to do that. We were constrained with people already, so and then trying to ramp for 2018, we chose to stay and support our customers here in the States at this point. We'll continue to look at opportunities in Puerto Rico.","Noelle Christine Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Duncan with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Nice job this quarter.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","So, Duke, the first question I've got and look I appreciate that you guys have to be conservative around the timing of pipeline projects, but when I break down what's going on in your Oil and Gas segment, it makes the guide look really conservative, right? Stronghold, if I remember correctly, was supposed to do less than $200 million in 2017. We're now talking closer to $600 million in 2018. So that's $400 million of growth, that's more than 10% right there. And you're talking about the large diameter pipeline spreads being, it sounds like more utilized this year than last. So was it really just as simple as until some of the large diameter work starts, you're going to assume less than perfect timing on those start dates, is that really what we should be thinking about with relation to where the guidance is?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, Matt, I think, if you look at what we guided and you think about this $550 million to $600 million we talked about in Stronghold, we're on track there, we have not backed off that. When we look at our guidance, we are prudent about how we look at the large diameter pipe and how it's in the outer. We have not started. We've mobilized maybe on a few, but we have not started construction on any of our large diameter pipeline as we sit here today. So when we look at that and we take an approach to the quarter or to the year, we're going to take a prudent approach to gas and we always have and we will continue to do that. And we'll update you as we move along. As we move along on the projects, I do think we can execute through that, through some contingencies there. I think there's upside there on the outer quarters, but as far as it sits today, I think we put a prudent guidance which also includes EPS growth or at least growth in the segment. I can let Derrick to talk a little bit about that growth.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, to Duke's point, I mean, to the extent we see the higher revenue base overall and then expanding margin opportunity through our guidance, you can \u2013 it's broadly substantial, a bit of change from operating income contribution.","To the point on the revenue side, we're always going to take into consideration the risk of cancellations or delays within that segment, that's a pretty big component that we always look to be prudent about in the guidance. And from a standpoint as we move forward, we see the ability to expand on both the base business and continue to have some level of awards, but that's where the biggest risk of cancellation, delay can happen.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That helps. I appreciate it guys. And then sticking with that business for my second question sort of longer-term, can you talk just a little bit about what the market outlook is there? I know there's always a little bit of consternation in the investment community, people concerned about when the peak is for pipeline activity. You guys, obviously, are the largest pipeline contractor in both U.S. and Canada, I would think have a pretty unique perspective on the visibility that you have to projects beyond what we all can see. So as you sit here today, how long do you think you can continue to grow that segment? What is just the intermediate term market outlook there?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, for us, I think when you look at it, it's broken up into two or three pieces. So if you look at the industrial business and what we did there, it's more of a what we call our base business, our core business, it's repetitive in nature. We've talked about the growth there. We think we can grow that high single, double digits. It's got a longer-term outlook to it.","And we also have our distribution business that's along that, the same thing there. We're working on getting scale a lot of offices this year and things of that nature in that distribution business to increase our margin profile. So you'll see us take some breath and make sure that we grow our margins in that period \u2013 in that piece of business. We also have a midstream business that's underneath that typically when \u2013 after you build large diameter pipe, it goes back and then you get a lot of takeaway, storage, things of that nature in the midstream piece, which we have a really nice business there and that continues.","And on the larger diameter pipe, Canada has been down a bit. They've got to get policy there that will allow to get capacity takeaway. So that has pulled back some. But when you look at it and look at the projects that are out there, I mean, you still have the Keystones of the world. You still have a lot of LNG takeaway that we're hearing now, export capabilities on oil in the U.S. We talked about that in the past where if you saw some LNG exports start, you would see more gas needed, as far as transportation, those are large diameter pipe.","So, I think the market, the way I see it today, has elongated a bit, so that's a good thing on the large diameter pipe. And we're building our nice base business underneath that, which when we look at the interest rates and what's going on in the replacement and things of that nature, our utility customers have got \u2013 already put in place bonds and things of that nature to support their CapEx on the distribution side, cast iron, steel replacement, all the things that are going on. It's just a matter of us manning and getting scale out of these offices, which will create incremental margin underneath and we won't be so reliant on this large diameter pipe as we move out past 2020 and beyond, because that's the market that's cyclical and we talked about the lumpiness of it and then us trying to stabilize that.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. I appreciate it. Thanks for the break-down.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning. I have a couple of follow-up questions. One, in terms of just following up a Matt's question on the Oil and Gas business, I mean, if you back out Stronghold, you're essentially assuming your organic business is flat. So is there something specific to Quanta in terms of capacity concerns, in terms of projects that we're more worried about certain projects are getting cancelled or not going forward, I just want to make sure there's nothing specific to Quanta or something that's in your backlog?","My second question is what is the expected EPS contribution from Stronghold in 2018 relative to 2017? And then last, can you just talk about \u2013 understanding the Electric Power margins are being hurt somewhat by investment in communications, can you talk about how long that's a headwind or what's the revenue base we need to see for the communications business to get more to the double-digit range that you target longer-term? Thanks.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Okay, Jamie. The Gas side, I would say in general, when we look at our Gas business and the guidance that we provided, one, Stronghold, we said $550 million to $600 million high-single digits, we stand by that as far as margin contribution and EPS contribution. When we look at the rest of the business and what we talked about was prudent approach to guidance, there's nothing in the backlog that would say that alarms us as far as getting started or when it starts, we've taken a prudent approach to it, just to make sure that we get started. I mean, I think it's important for us, as we start the year on these large diameter projects and the risks associated with them that we take that approach to guidance and we did.","In the underlying business, it's growing really well. We are taking some breath in the distribution business to make sure we can get some scale out of the current offices that we have. I thought that was important. If you look at where we're at from a margin profile, I think we're picking up the whole margin in this segment. So that being said, we are moving the margin up in this segment.","And as far as telecom on the Electric Power, it is dragging some, I think, by \u2013 when we go out in the third and fourth quarter, we're engineering, we're getting into construction, I think we have $400 million of backlog in North America right now, there's no stopping, people wanting us to put facilities in the ground and in the air.","So that being said, we're concentrated on making sure we have the right labor force and the execution strategy to move that forward as we sit today and I think as we look into the midpoint of the year, you'll start to see that be at least at parity with our current Electric margins on the outer third and fourth quarter.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then just, sorry, the Stronghold contribution, I think before you were targeting, I think, in 2017, it was supposed to lose $0.05 and then swing to positive $0.10 contribution in 2018, is that still what we're expecting?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I said $550 million to $600 million in revenue and...","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","No, I'm talking on EPS, so, EPS contribution.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, I think that....","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","I'll let Derrick comment.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, Jamie, that's fair from an EPS perspective. It should swing \u2013 we're looking at it basically swinging back to about the $0.10 we talked about previously. Our overall guidance expectations for Stronghold for revenue and margins are consistent with what we said in our original acquisition call.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Alan Fleming with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Duke, we've heard a lot about the tightness on the Gas side and demand outstripping available capacity. Does that tightness allow you or give you more control in terms of how you ramp up these large projects as you get into the second half of the year? And would you say visibility today is better than where you've started out the last couple of years?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, on the large diameter side, I mean as far as us seeing the work, we can see it, it starts and stops. And when they start, it's something that's out of our control. So anything that we can control, we certainly can put it on a piece of paper and execute it. The most of the works in, what I would consider, risky terrain and parts of that area that we're very familiar with, we understand that area, we bid it appropriately to make sure that we've covered our risk off in those areas. So I think we've done a nice job of putting together a book of work that we're happy about going into 2018. And for us, it's just about getting started on it, executing through on some of the contingency in it and getting back to you on it. But we're real proud of what we got. I mean our companies that are under that are 100 years old that built most of the large diameter pipe or a lot of the large diameter pipe in North America. So we understand it very, very well.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And I think previously you had talked about expecting some of the industrial related work that you lost out on when the hurricanes hit in the second half of 2017 potentially coming back this year. Have you started to see that happen? And do you think there's any pent-up demand there on the industrial side on the Gulf Coast that can start to shake loose here in the early part of 2018?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. That's a new acquisition for us. And I think as we look at it, we're real happy with the acquisition and what we're seeing there. I'm cautious about how to talk about this year, but I think in general, we're seeing more demand. Whether it's Harvey related or not? I can't be sure, but I think we're seeing more demand in the services that we offer in industrial space and we're real happy with what we see.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. I'll leave it there, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Chad.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So can you walk through some of the moving pieces behind your Oil and Gas outlook? Just trying to think through how LDC business contributes as well as on the midstream side? And just a question on Stronghold as well. I know that there's some cost absorption issues that impacted performance in 3Q and 4Q of last year. Just trying to get a sense for whether we're fully beyond that or will there be some absorption issues that play through until 1Q?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","I think, in general, we've talked a little bit about it. As far as industrial, we stand behind the guidance we gave there. We've taken a prudent approach to our large diameter pipe. Our takeaway capacity that's there as far as what's out there, they continue to build that. It's Texas, the Permian Basin, continues to be prolific. So, I mean, we see a really nice market there. I think when we talk about it, it's the distribution business that we're saying that we invested in last year. We're able to now take that and get scale out of those offices and we'll start executing.","When you look at year-over-year, you have some \u2013 you had Sabal Trail going in the first half last year. We don't have it going right now. So we're starting with no large diameter pipe in the first quarter for that matter and a little bit in Canada. So there is some difference in the way the years fall out. So it's more second quarter and beyond, driven on large diameter pipe and we take that approach in guidance.","Canada is still, I would say, out of all of it is still the unknown as it sits today. The large diameter pipe \u2013 you have Line 3 up there that's under RFQ now and some of the other larger projects are still in RFQ stages. So that's probably, I would say, if we had a visibility issue, it would be Canada in large diameter pipe. But we're real happy with where we're at and we think we have a really good market in 2018.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's helpful. And then, switching over to large transmission. Can you speak to your expectations on utilization? I was trying to think through just the number of projects that you have. You have Fort McMurray already in construction, the East-West Tie Line, recent win with the large Florida project and potentially Wind Catcher. Just trying to think through over the next maybe one to two years, I mean how should we think about the collective, I guess, utilization or productivity peak for these projects and where will that head?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think if you look at it and you see the CapEx and the OpEx, we're on two large projects, would be three with the Florida project there. We're able to put up $5.9 billion or so, $6 billion or so of Electric Power revenue with those large projects. That will continue to grow.","We continue to see the CapEx, OpEx budgets of these customers be prolific. And I can't stress it enough about the business that it's what's driving the business. We're talking about Wind Catchers and Northern Pass and all those kind of things every day, none of that is in our outlook, none of that is in our backlog, none of that is what we're considering what's driving this business today. It's really the enhancement of us providing solutions to our customers so they can be successful in their capital deployments and OpEx deployments. And that's what's driving the Electric Power business on a daily basis, which what's driving Quanta for the most part on that 60%, 65% of our business.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to start with telecom. Can you just talk about the trends you're seeing in the U.S.? And then also, what are your thoughts on continued U.S. telecom backlog growth in 2018?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. The telecom business is robust. We talk about it daily with our larger customers there, us being back in the business. It's certainly something that's \u2013 it's getting a lot of our attention here. We're able to talk to a variety of customers about their builds. It's a really good market. What we're in now, I mean, we're engineering a lot of projects. We're starting to put boots on the ground and delivering at this point. So it's something that I think is going to continue. You see the markets in 5G, 4Gs in places still. Our Latin America market and Canada market is good. So we're excited about the business, so we continue to put people in the air and on the ground. So us, it's just now about execution. And I think we can continue to build backlog. We talked about $1 billion and I stand behind it. We're still headed that direction.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Great. And then, just a clarification on these other expenses. When do those projects end that are generated in the other expenses?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I mean I would tell you that you should expect to some extent that we would see that probably over the mid to long-term portion of our visibility, because we continue to believe that we'll go through and make investments in other projects as we move forward. The projects that are sitting here today that are influencing that number, those go into an 2018 and 2019 type timeframe, but I would continue to expect that 2019, 2020 and beyond, that you'd see some sort of level of that other expense or deferral as we continue to pursue other types of investments.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Rygiel with FBR & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Thanks, and good morning, gentlemen.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Alex.","Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Two quick questions. First, in the gas distribution business, congratulations on picking up some more share there. Could you help us to kind of frame the size of that either as a percentage of total Oil and Gas segment or sort of the annual revenue run rate that gas distribution is on right now? Maybe talk a little bit about the growth rate in that business in 2018 versus 2017. And then, from a more macro standpoint, talk about the margin profile of that business and how it's changed over the last couple of years and where it could get to?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. So thanks, Alex, for the question. I think the gas distribution business, it's basically underneath, that it's really the steel replacement, the cast iron replacement and all the things that are going on from an integrity standpoint in distribution systems. You have low interest, low fuel cost so the regulators are really putting money into to replacing the systems and it's broad-based, it's U.S. based, it's all over.","So that being said, labor constraints and things like that, us building it organic \u2013 growing it organically and building these offices has put pressure on the margin profile of the segment. So it's difficult because there is some large steel, low pressure steel that goes along with some of that replacements, so you're \u2013 it really looks and feels like a midstream job in many ways other than being in the city.","So you do cross a little bit, so we can move crews back and forth on some of those cast iron and steel replacement jobs. It's a nice market, it's a 20-year, 30-year build, we've seen it people pull back from saying 50 to 60 and now they want to do in 30 years. So you're starting to see that. I think our acquisition in Northwest Line will allow us to train those \u2013 our folks in the field faster and we could put more crews together and grow that business. But if you look at the growth of the business, I think we can grow it in the high to mid-single digits year-over-year. And I'll let Derrick talk about how it complements the whole segment.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, the distribution on its own, it probably runs in the 20% to 25% of the overall segment. It's a component of what we consider to be base business for that which is on average is still running about 75% of everything but that component alone probably runs in the 20% range.","Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","It's very helpful. And then on NLC, is this just a cost center and if so what's the annual drag that we should think about if we should even think about it that way?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","No, I don't look at it like that, I think it can \u2013 it is a cost center to some extent, but it also earns revenue as well, it's a nice business. It offsets some of our training costs as well. When we look at it, we look at it as a solution really to our customers' labor solution and to ourselves, and it allows us to train and facilitate our training and get people deployed faster. And also when they hit the ground, people today, kids today, we need to put them out there smarter. And so they're able to be smarter when they hit the ground. And I think a pre-apprentice piece of this and it allows us to really complement our already trade associations and things that we're doing today and work in a collaborative effort with our client and our trade associations to deploy more people and grow organically faster and more economical. So it's difficult to say what that is synergistically, but is itself, I mean, if you just look at the margins on what they do on any given day, their margins are comparable to our Electric segment.","Alex Rygiel - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Newby with D. A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.","William Newby - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Bill.","William Newby - D. A. Davidson & Co.","I just had a couple of follow-ups on the telecom. Duke, you kind of mentioned that $1 billion revenue target kind of longer-term, I think originally you had said that's kind of a medium-term target, is that \u2013 I mean can you give us any more color there on how quickly you guys think you can get to $1 billion, is that a 2019 event or are we still too soon to tell?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think 2019 is a stretch, I would say it's more longer than shorter. But we're \u2013 I think you'll incrementally see us. It's a matter of how much labor can we deploy in the field and how well can we execute on these larger projects. And so for us, I mean the macro market's certainly there for us to do that, I mean, in any given area. If we look at our international markets and also what's going on in the lower 48, we can certainly get there.","If we chose to do some regional acquisitions or things of that nature, we can expedite that. We were talking about doing that organically as it sits. So I think in general, it just depends on how we look at it on a go-forward basis. But the market's there, I don't want to press it, we want to make sure we can execute, so we'll take a prudent approach to how fast we get there.","William Newby - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. I appreciate that. And then I guess on the margin side, it's good to hear that those margins in that business should be on par with Electric by the end of this year, it sounds like. Is there more upside there as you continue to ramp it? I mean could those margins be accretive to Electric Power segment by the time you get to $1 billion in revenue?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, I mean I think you see our pure play competition, I think when you see that, there's no reason why with our boots on the ground capabilities and what we're able to accomplish, we couldn't have comparable margins or should. My expectations is we would have comparable margins to what you see out of those guys. We're growing this business organically and so when you're growing anything organically, it costs money to grow. And I think it gets unnoticed the amount of resources, both on the distribution side of the business on the Gas side, the Electric side and the organic growth that it takes to put people in the air and train them, it costs money and it drags a little bit. But for the longer-term, if we look at the company 5, 10 years and the ability for us to continue to grow our EBITDA and margins, that's there. We continue to do that and we'll continue to do it for the foreseeable future.","William Newby - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thanks for the color. I'll jump back in the queue.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I wondered if you could talk about how revenue recognition changes are affecting your financials and the guidance for 2018.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, actually we have \u2013 anticipate fairly little impact. I think that we're looking at something in kind of a low single, maybe kind of double-digit cumulative effect that we may be booking here in the first quarter, but broadly I think you'll see absolute kind of negligible impact on our overall revenue recognition.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just a further clarification on the large diameter pipe guidance assumptions, I know you're trying to be prudent, but maybe you can kind of tell us how much you have included in your guidance that's not actually permitted at this point. And if you could kind of quantify for us how much large diameter pipeline work you did in 2017 versus what your base case is for 2018?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I mean I can tell you and I'll let Derrick talk to the comment on the end. But as far as us mobilizing and things, it's not a permit issue, more so it's just making sure that we do mobilize and nothing else comes up on those larger projects. We feel confident that they'll all go. We're not concerned at this point with that. And so we've taken that into account in the guidance. We don't have a bunch of cancellations or anything like that. You could see some slippage quarter-over-quarter or things with that nature. We're still looking at work and booking work on a daily basis. I mean we're booking work in the quarter. We'll continue to book work. So that being said, it's still a robust market as we sit today. Now I'll let Derrick comment on the amount to the segment.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. In 2017, I think the big thing to remember is that the first portion of the year had a substantial amount of winter work, which is not necessarily normal for us. So 2017 had a larger portion of mainline contribution likely overall. As an example, when you come into 2018, you're not seeing very much of that. And it's what's bringing the overall revenue base down. I would say that in 2017, we did north of $1.5 billion and in this year right now, we still see the opportunity, but we're probably a little less than that as we stand here today.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing comments.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah.

Duke?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. On the call, I will provide an operational and strategic overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detail review of our second quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","The environment we have been operating in has been challenging for the first six months of the year. In particular, our Canadian operations continued to experience the effects of a down-market. We continue to make necessary changes in our cost structure to adjust to the market conditions and believe we are on track to deliver on our expectations for the remaining six months of the year. However, the ongoing challenges on the power plant project in Alaska distort the overall performance of the core operations.","As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, we incurred additional losses on the power plant project in Alaska during the second quarter. Late in the quarter, during the late stages of the commissioning phase, a project experienced a claimed force majeure event.","We have also experienced further deficiencies in third-party engineering that caused changes to the planned scope of work as well as failures of other contractors operating on site. The combination of these issues resulted in a significant increase in estimated cost to complete the project. We are in the early stages of developing estimates for potential recovery for the items from the customer and other parties.","I'm fully aware that we have been discussing losses on this project for the last year. And we take the issue seriously. We are all disappointed that we have incurred additional losses on this project and with the performance of the project overall. We remain focused on completing the project.","While our core electric segment performance in the quarter was solid, the power plant losses in the second quarter were not previously contemplated in our guidance. And as a result, we have adjusted our full year guidance to reflect this impact. We continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our Electric Power segment and remain focused on restoring our operating income margins for the segment to historical levels.","We continue to believe Quanta's market-leading position, coupled with industry dynamics such as an aging grid that requires significant investment to maintain reliability, the generation mix shifting to more renewables and natural gas, and the implementation of existing newer, more demanding government regulations should provide opportunities for our core transmission and distribution operations to grow.","We will continue to build our base transmission and distribution business, while remaining nimble to capitalize on large multi-year project opportunities that develop as evidenced by the two large electric project awards announced this morning.","In June, Quanta was chosen by a Midwest utility to construct a new 100-mile double-circuit 345 kilovolt transmission line in its service territory. Our scope of work includes access roads, foundations, steel pole erection, wire stringing and material management. Construction began in late June and the project is scheduled to complete in the third quarter of 2018.","Incremental to Electric Power backlog at the end of the second quarter is the large electric transmission and distribution project awarded to us about by a California-based utility that we signed a contract for in July. Our scope of work includes the engineering, procurement and construction of this project, including rebuilding and replacing approximately 145 miles of 12 kilovolt and 69 kilovolt underground and overhead electric power infrastructure.","The project is located in a national forest area in southern California. Engineering and related services for this project has begun and completion is anticipated in late 2019. The aggregate contract value of these two projects is approximately $500 million.","We continue to see substantial bidding activity and are pursuing a number of additional large high-voltage electric transmission projects in both Canada and the United States. As an industry leader in providing solutions for large high-voltage transmission projects, we believe Quanta is well positioned to capitalize on the project opportunities we see in the marketplace.","Also, you may recall that several years ago Quanta partnered with American Electric Power or AEP to upgrade approximately 240 miles of their 345 kilovolt transmission infrastructure in South Texas. The line remained in an energized state using our patented energize technologies. For this project in June, AEP won the Edison Electric Institute's 2016 Edison Award, the electric power industry's most prestigious honor. Quanta is proud to have partnered with AEP and we appreciate the confidence they placed in us to provide them with a safe, innovative and cost effective infrastructure solution.","Turning to our Oil and Gas segment, revenues and margins in the second quarter were softer than anticipated, primarily due to permitting delays on several large pipeline projects in our backlog and, to a lesser extent, due to certain negative project conditions. As discussed on prior earnings calls, we expect improved performance for this segment as we move through the year, with the second half of the year being meaningfully stronger than the first half, driven by a significant increase in large pipeline revenue contributions.","In the second quarter, three of our large diameter pipeline projects were waiting for client authorization to commence work. The authorizations were contingent upon the customer receiving certain government permits, which have taken longer to obtain and have pushed anticipated construction start dates from the second quarter of this year to the third quarter.","We have since received authorization to begin work on one of the projects and believe we can complete the project within our original estimates for the year. For the remaining projects, communications with our customers indicate that work is probable to move forward in the third quarter, which is what is reflected in our current guidance.","While project delays generate headlines and the impact of timing project starts, we believe that on a macro level such delays coupled with the healthy end-market drivers and strong demand for our large pipeline project services could yield an active pipeline market that could prove to be longer and more consistent rather than a relatively short boom and bust cycle.","And as LNG export facilities come online in North America and export volumes increase, we expect additional large pipelines will need to be constructed later in this decade to feed considerable volumes of natural gas to those facilities. While the LNG market is facing challenges due to low oil prices, it is a market we are watching with cautious optimism.","The large pipeline market remains very active. We continue to work with our customers on large additional pipeline projects and have visibility into significant project activity for the next several years. While some projects are experiencing permitting environmental delays, others are successfully receiving FERC and other approvals and are progressing forward. The bidding and negotiating environment is robust and the majority of our project opportunities in the United States continue to be driven by natural gas. In addition, we are experiencing increasing and ongoing levels of discussion with various customers about large pipeline projects in Canada.","Regarding some of the other services we provide in our base business that are reflected in the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment, demand continues for our natural gas distribution and pipeline integrity services. And we believe there are attractive growth opportunities for many years. Increasing natural gas demand and new pipeline safety regulations should continue to drive multi-year opportunities in the natural gas distribution market as customer integrity programs continue to accelerate.","As expected, our midstream gathering activities are down meaningfully versus prior years. This is primarily due to the lack of takeaway capacity to move natural gas out of the production areas in the Marcellus and Utica Shales to market and lower commodity prices for natural gas liquids. Challenging conditions in Canada due to low oil prices have also impacted our midstream gathering business. However, we believe that this market is beginning to stabilize.","In summary, we continue to have a positive multi-year view on the end markets we serve and believe we're all well positioned to provide unique solutions to our customers. As discussed in our prior calls, we believed the first half of this year could be choppy and it was. However, we expect a significant increase in activity levels and improved financial results in the second half of the year, which is supported by our strong backlog.","In addition, we believe market conditions for our Canadian Electric Power and Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services operations have stabilized and that those markets are in the early stages of recovery. We believe consolidation among our customers in both the electric utility and pipeline industries will be positive for Quanta going forward. As our customers get larger, they are continuing to partner with Quanta because of our scope and skill, innovative solutions and strong financial position.","We're also seeing the convergence of the electric utility and natural gas pipeline, which we anticipated years ago and are well positioned to benefit from. Looking forward in market drivers, our entrepreneurial business model, having the best skilled leadership and the largest skilled workforce in the markets we serve, will continue to distinguish us in the marketplace and position us to continue to grow our core business over time.","We see increasing activity and opportunity for the award of large, high-voltage electric transmission projects over the near and medium term, and the large pipeline project market remains robust with a multi-year cycle ahead of us. This management team is focused on operating the business for the long term. We will continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership.","We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset will continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for all of our stakeholders.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our second quarter results. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Duke, and good morning everyone. Today we announced revenues of $1.79 billion for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.87 billion in the prior year second quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $16.6 million or $0.11 per diluted share. These results compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $32 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as presented in today's press release, was $0.18 for the second quarter 2016 as compared to $0.24 for the second quarter 2015. Although Duke commented a bit on some of the items impacting our results for the quarter, I'll provide some additional commentary before discussing the detailed financial review.","As pointed out in today's earnings release, the power plant construction project in Alaska negatively impacted the quarter by approximately $30.5 million in project losses or $0.12 per diluted share. At quarter end, this project had a contract value at $201 million and was approximately 90% complete. This project is expected to be substantially completed near the end of the third quarter 2016.","As this project continues through the final commissioning phases, it is possible that additional unforeseen circumstances or other performance issues could occur and result in the recognition of additional losses on this project. However, our current estimates represent all issues known at this time.","The year-to-date project losses on the power plant are $51.8 million or $31.6 million net of tax and $0.20 per diluted share, and has impacted the year-to-date Electric Power segment operating margins by approximately 220 basis points. We are in the process of developing claims related to these losses that resulted during and even prior to the second quarter. However, we have not reflected any damage recovery in our estimate of total project loss.","Our results for the quarter were also negatively impacted by certain other items that were outside of our previous expectations. As Duke spoke of, we had lower overall reported revenues versus our expectations, which had a corresponding adverse impact on gross profit, driven largely by shifts in the timing of the start date on certain large diameter pipeline projects and, to lesser extent, a negative impact associated with the wildfires in Alberta, Canada.","Additionally, we had some slight overages in costs on existing projects within the Oil and Gas segment, some of which we will be seeking to recover through future change orders, but otherwise negatively impacted the quarter by around $0.02.","Lastly, our tax rate for the quarter and year is higher than anticipated due to the current estimate of the mix of our annual earnings being more heavily weighted to domestic rather than foreign operations as well as the effect of a reduction in expected tax benefit from foreign restructurings, which were originally expected to benefit the entire year, but now won't be a benefit until the third quarter. These tax items impacted the quarter by approximately $0.02.","Turning to a broader discussion of our quarter-over-quarter results, the decrease in consolidated revenues in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the same quarter of last year was primarily associated with the decrease in larger electric transmission and larger diameter pipeline projects as customers continue to face heightened regulatory and environmental requirements from state and federal agencies and more stringent permitting processes.","This increased regulatory environment impacted the timing of existing projects and delayed the development of other necessary infrastructure projects, which has had a corresponding negative impact on the level of demand for our services. Partially offsetting these decreases was the favorable impact of approximately $40 million in revenues generated by acquired companies primarily in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.","Our consolidated gross margin was 11.2% in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 12.2% in the second quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the previously mentioned decrease in revenues from larger electric transmission projects and larger pipeline projects, which typically yield higher margins. In addition, the higher cost on existing projects within the Oil and Gas segment as compared to last quarter and the lack of corresponding change orders on these costs impacted margin comparability.","Gross margins were also impacted by losses on the power plant project of $30.5 million in the quarter, which compares to $25.1 million of losses during the three months ended June 30, 2015 related to the same power plant project and an electric transmission project in Canada.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were $156.6 million in the second quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $6.7 million as compared to the second quarter of 2015. This increase was a result of $2.8 million in higher cost associated with ongoing technology and business development efforts and $2.2 million in incremental G&A costs associated with the acquired companies.","Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 8.7% in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 8% in the second quarter of 2015. This increase was due to the slightly higher G&A costs as well as the reduced revenues for the second quarter of 2016.","To further discuss our segment results, Electric Power revenues were $1.16 billion, reflecting a decrease of $63.2 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 5.2%. Revenues during the second quarter of 2016 were negatively impacted by continued regulatory constraints on the volume and timing of customer spending as compared to the second quarter of 2015, which included higher levels of revenues from larger transmission projects that were nearing completion.","Foreign currency exchange rates also negatively impacted second quarter 2016 revenues in this segment by approximately $8 million. These negative factors were partially offset by the contribution of approximately $30 million in revenues from acquired companies.","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment decreased to 6.6% in the second quarter of 2016 as compared 7.2% in last year's second quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the previously mentioned reduced revenues from larger electric transmission projects and a corresponding increase in lower margin revenues from smaller scale transmission work.","In addition, margins are negatively impacted by certain large transmission resources being underutilized during the quarter as we continue to bear certain costs to ensure we are positioned to execute on larger transmission opportunities. As I mentioned previously, operating margins for the second quarters of both 2016 and 2015 were negatively impacted by project losses on one or two large projects.","As of June 30, 2016, 12-month backlog for the Electric Power segment was relatively flat and total backlog decreased slightly when compared to March 31, 2016 due to normal contract burn being effectively offset by new contract awards. Backlog as of quarter-end does not reflect the large California transmission and distribution project announcement included in today's release.","Oil and Gas segment revenues decreased quarter-over-quarter by $16.7 million or 2.6% to $633.3 million in the second quarter of 2016. This decrease is primarily a result of the fluctuations in large project timing I spoke of earlier. Segment revenues contributed by international operations were also negatively impacted by approximately $6 million as a result of less favorable foreign currency exchange rate. These decreases were partially offset by increased activity from distribution services as well as the contribution of approximately $10 million of revenues from acquired companies.","Operating income for the Oil and Gas segment as a percentage of revenues decreased to 1.9% in 2Q 2016 from 5.5% in 2Q 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of larger pipeline projects which typically yield higher margins, as well as a higher contribution from distribution services which typically carry a lower margin profile.","Also negatively impacting operating income were higher costs associated with challenging site conditions on an ongoing transmission project in Canada and a customer request for additional project closeout efforts on a U.S. transmission project that was substantially completed in 2015. While we intend to pursue change orders for additional compensation from our customers for certain of these items, no portion of these amounts have been included in our estimates of contract value as of quarter end.","12-month backlog for the Oil and Gas segment decreased by $47.8 million or 1.9% and total backlog decreased $273.7 million or 7.4% when compared to March 31, 2016. These decreases were due to burn of backlog, partially offset by the positive impact of scope increases to various contracts.","Corporate and non-allocated costs decreased $2.8 million in the second quarter 2016 as compared to Q2 2015, primarily as a result of lower acquisition and integration cost due to the timing of acquisitions. For the second quarter of 2016, operating cash flow from continuing operations provided approximately $66.5 million and net capital expenditures were approximately $55.7 million, resulting in approximately $10.8 million of free cash flow as compared to free cash flow of approximately $51.4 million for the second quarter 2015.","Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by the less favorable operating results. Cash flows from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016 provided approximately $266.3 million. And net capital expenditures were approximately $98.3 million, resulting in approximately $168 million of year-to-date free cash flow. Despite fairly strong year-to-date free cash flow, un-built production hung up in the approval process with a few customers has kept our working capital requirements a bit higher.","We expect to see some resolution to these billing delays during the third quarter. However, the ramp up of the large diameter pipeline work in the latter half of the year is expected to be a use of cash, so remains difficult to estimate the overall free cash flow for the year. DSOs were 74 days at June 30, 2016 compared to 75 days at December 31, 2015 and 85 days at June 30, 2015.","At quarter-end, we had approximately $162.3 million in cash. At the end of the quarter, we also had about $317.3 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments, and we had $398 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $1.26 billion in total liquidity as of June 30, 2016.","Turning to guidance, for the year ending 2016, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.75 billion and $8 billion. This range contemplates Electric Power segment revenues ranging from a 3% decline year-over-year at the low-end of our guidance to revenues in the segment remaining flat at the higher-end of our estimate, with the remaining difference in revenues coming from growth in the Oil and Gas segment. As it relates to seasonality, we continue to expect a market increase in revenues and margins as we move into the third quarter, largely driven by the timing of large diameter pipeline work.","Additionally, due to some of the project timing issues that Duke spoke of earlier, we believe the fourth quarter revenues may not decline as we have seen with typical seasonality in the past, but instead, will likely increase when compared to this year's third quarter. For 2016, we believe the Electric Power segment operating margins should be around 8%, with the year-to-date losses of the power plant of $51.8 million having a negative impact of approximately 100 basis points on the overall operating margin for the segment.","We still see the Oil and Gas segment margins coming in between 5.5% and 7% for the year, but due to the lower margins seen in the first and second quarter of 2016, the upper-end may be more challenging. Also, due to the revenue shifts mentioned earlier, margins in the Oil and Gas segment are likely to be higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter.","Our outlook includes estimates for project start dates that we believe are probable based on customer communications. However, variances in these estimated start dates could lead to revenue and earnings results that may be materially different from our current estimates. In addition, some of these projects are larger in contract value, such that performance of any individual project that significantly exceeds or is left in our current estimates could also impact our earnings results materially. Lastly, our outlook does not assume any recovery of the project losses recognized to date on the power plant project, even though the company is pursuing various remedies for recovery.","We estimate that interest expense will be between $15 million and $17 million for 2016 and are currently protecting our GAAP tax rate for 2016 to be around 39.5%. The third and fourth quarter rates will be around 38.5%. Also, our annual 2016 guidance reflects the current foreign exchange rate environment. Fluctuations of foreign exchange rates could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and cause actual financial results to differ from guidance.","For purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share for the year ended 2016, we are assuming 157.1 million weighted average shares outstanding. We anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.20 and $1.35 and contemplate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.52 and $1.67.","I believe it is important to note that had it not been for the incremental impact of the second quarter loss from the power plant project in Alaska, our previous annual guidance would've remained unchanged. CapEx for all of 2016 should be approximately $200 million to $220 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2015 of $210 million.","We expect to continue to maintain our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, positioning the company for continued internal growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with the focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investments and the repurchase of Quanta stock.","This concludes our formal presentation and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, Duke.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good morning.","Operator","I apologize. Something happened. Our next question is from the line of Matt Duncan. Please state your question.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Hi, good morning, guys.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good morning.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Matt.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","So, first question I've got is really just kind of big picture on the electrical business. Does it feel like that that business may be turning a corner here? My recollection is that you had only been working on one larger job, and I know a year or two ago that was more like 10. These two that you announced today are going to take that up to three. The Fort McMurray job is going to start presumably later this year, early next year. So it seems like we may be turning a corner here, but just kind of want your updated thoughts there.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah. What I think we would say is that we believe that the Canadian markets are stabilizing, which is what was somewhat of a drag on our earnings power in the segment. We will be starting on those three projects \u2013 the second \u2013 we're started on the second and will be on the third here shortly. And some pre-engineering has been done on that one.","So, yes, I think we are starting to see the projects. And our base business in that segment, as we've said in the past, continues to build. Less the power plant, we feel like we're moving forward with that as expected. I think we've stated in the past that the first quarter would be choppy and it was and, again, we're moving as expected in the segment.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. So, taking everything into consideration then, Duke, is it fair to assume that with the way things are turning there that we ought to expect some measure of growth in 2017? It's really just going to up to the permitting process to determine how much?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Our backlog would be indicative of that. But, again, we'll watch the project starts and make sure that they move into full production. Again, our base will grow. Everything that we see in our backlog indicates that the projects are there. So, we'll have to evaluate where the permits come in and when they start.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","And then on the Oil and Gas side, just trying to get a sense for sort of delays. It sounds like those are really just permitting related rather than a customer kind of slowing anything down. Can you maybe tell us a little bit more about the timeline of when you expect the two that haven't yet started up to get started? And if, for whatever reason, one of those slid out of this year, what kind of impact could that have relative to your guidance?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah. I wouldn't say \u2013 again, we're started on all of the projects but two. And the two that we haven't started on, we're in constant communications with our customer and believe those will start in the second half of the third quarter is what I'd say, just to characterize it.","So, I don't want to get too specific on it other than just to say the second half of the third quarter. And as those move into construction, I believe our guidance contemplates that. And as far as what happens if they move out of the quarter, again, we would have to come back and communicate what that means and evaluate where we're at on all the other projects to decide what kind of guidance we would give on that and we would come back if it changed materially.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, guys. Am I on for sure this time?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good morning, Tahira. Yeah, you're on.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Duke, for many years, you guys have had a very good execution history and we were hoping, as you take over the realm, that we would start to see that come back. Can you talk a bit about ownership if we continue to really see \u2013 obviously, the Alaska project will be essentially done, but these pipeline projects which were just $0.02 this quarter, that's a pretty core business for you. Who has ownership there? What happens if those continue to mount?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah. Tahira, I have ownership in all of them. They eventually get to me and they're my ownership. So, again, I take responsibility for every project we deliver. So, the power plant, for example, is not core to us. It's not indicative of what's in our backlog, and we don't have any binding proposals on power plant work \u2013 combined cycle power plant work. We do not have any proposals out there.","So, if you look at the rest of the backlog in the Electric Power segment, it's very core to us. Many of these companies have been in business 50 years plus, some 100 years. And we understand that business very well. The power plant was not something that was core to us. And it has distorted our results and we have not executed well on it, as you've seen.","We also have claims on that job that we have not pursued and we will. So, the power \u2013 and also in the pipeline, I would say, again, we're very proud of the management team we have. We've executed in the past on large pipeline projects. If you go back to 2010 and past when we had this many spreads running on large pipeline projects, we executed very well. I expect us to execute very well as we move forward. The market's robust. We continue to bid work. And I think, from our standpoint, what's in our guidance is accurate reflection of where we're at as a company.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And so, Duke, maybe you can provide a little more color on those $0.02 on the pipeline side, where the impact came in and maybe that will help to some degree. And then, on the positive note, would love to get a little more color on what you're seeing on the electric transmission side, probably the most encouraging commentary I've heard from you guys in a little while on the near term. Any color on that would be helpful as well.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Tahira, I think from my standpoint, when we gave year guidance, we anticipated the back-end to accelerate due to the large pipeline projects. If you take out the power plant from our year, I think we're on track to deliver what we thought we would deliver for the year. And again, the power plant has distorted who we are as a company this year. And if you take it out, I think our guidance is intact and that's how I feel about it as we move forward.","As far as the Electric Power business, we're optimistic. We're seeing some signs of the HVDC market \u2013 a large HVDC market starting to improve. We continue to bid work. The jobs we're on we're executing well. And again, that's our core business and our base in that segment continues to build. We're also seeing our base in the natural gas business continue to build. So, as far as I'm concerned, we're proud of our base business and we'll move forward in that.","Our second quarter Oil and Gas margins will improve due to the work mix, with the large pipeline projects coming on and significant amount \u2013 over 10 introduction. You'll start to see our Oil and Gas margins turn the corner the other way just on work mix alone. I know the fourth quarter. We can see it as well. The fourth quarter is loaded with different kind of margin profile. We do understand that.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Duke.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chad Dillard of Deutsche Bank.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good morning.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, I just want to spend some time on the gathering sites. At the start of the year, you guys are down 50%. And then I just wanted to get a sense for how you're tracking against those expectations and you mentioned a little bit of stabilization. So, do you think you'll actually be able to hit break-even on your comps at the end of this year? And then how should we think about that for 2017?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah, I think, again, from our standpoint on the gathering business, we didn't expect it to be robust this year as expected. Our Canadian market in that side of the business is softer than what we expected just in general. The fires did impact that as well. We'll have to evaluate where that goes in the second half of the year, but in the Lower 48, the Marcellus and the Utica and, for that matter, most places, it's all about takeaway capacity and the commodity pricing.","So, as we get big pipe build which offsets anything that we anticipated in the downturn of the midstream market, we should move forward. And again, I think, we're at pretty low points there, and have the opportunity to move up as we move forward into the future years.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And I just wanted to circle back on the Canadian wildfires. I apologize if I missed it, but did you call out what the impact was to earnings for the quarter? And then, conversely, how big of an opportunity is the repair and restoration work for you guys over there? And is there any of that contemplated in guidance?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah, again, thankfully, all of our employees were safe in the fires and our customers were safe as well. And our guys did a nice job of helping each other out up there, so we're proud of that. As far as, financially, I don't think there is a minimal impact. Derrick will come back and comment on that, but I don't \u2013 there is some restoration in it. It's not meaningful in my mind as we move forward in the year. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. If it's related to the quarter, it's probably in around the $0.01 range, unique to wildfires.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Mannes of Avondale Partners.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good morning, Dan.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Dan.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Great. A couple of quick follow-ups, and maybe I misheard, I think it was in Derrick's commentary. I think there was some commentary about site conditions and transmission in Canada. I want to follow up. Does this all relate to the Labrador-Island Link? I know there has been some press reports about those issues with the foundations and also with the wires. And obviously, the wires aren't your issue, but just wondering if you can give us anymore color there?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah, I'll talk about Labrador. Again, Nalcor had a management change in Labrador recently. We're in constant contact with our client. Any issues there that may be in the press or that matter we're working with the client constantly on different things out there and the job is going as expected.","So, again, we don't think there's issues in Labrador. And as far as the projects, some of the projects what Derrick was talking about in his comments is just, in general, we have some contract terms that we're always working out with our clients and we're in various stages of that as we move forward through the year.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Sure.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Dan, that was a reference to some of the margin impact in Oil and Gas, not Electric.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Got it. Sorry. The term transmission threw me. Real quick on the bidding environment, particularly on the large pipe side. We've heard some other people comment that maybe, I know you said bidding and negotiating is robust, but I'm wondering if some of the big 2017, 2018 work is, is it being hung up at all just given all of the environmental issues? Is that actually slowing the bidding environment or the award activity at all and do you view that as a challenge?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","I think the challenge is trying to predict when it starts, Dan. Again, I don't think most of what we're looking at goes and if it's in the bidding stage or negotiating stage. Our clients are pretty bullish on it moving pipes on the ground. Things are good there. It's just about when it starts, can they get the permits?","We've all \u2013 I think the industry has adapted to some of the different regulations from a state standpoint, even in some of the FERC lines. So we've all moved out some. Again, some FERC lines go in and some don't, and we've taken all that into account as we look forward and we'll continue to take that into account as we look forward into 2017 and 2018 and beyond.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","And if you'll indulge me, the two projects that you're still waiting on full notice to proceed in the pipeline side, are those two projects related or unrelated?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","The projects that we talked about, one project permit is contingent upon another. So, as soon as one permit goes, the other one goes.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","And those are the two you were waiting on?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yes.","Daniel Mannes - Avondale Partners LLC","Got it. Thank for the color.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, guys.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Andrew.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. You talked in your guidance about Oil and Gas margin potentially coming in at the low-end of the 5.5% to 7% range that you originally guided to. I know part of this is just some extra noise in the first half. But it looks like a potential that the \u2013 your pipeline delay would just be a part of the cycle. What is your 2016 guidance say about Quanta's ability to get Oil and Gas margin back to the longer-term goal of 9% to 12% margin in the segment? And could margin potentially just be structurally lower this cycle given some of the issues that you've mentioned in your gathering business and maybe some continuing issues in Canada?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Andrew, actually my comments weren't so much to say to that we would expect margins to be in the low-end of the range. It's just saying that relative to 5.5% to 7%, posting a 7% for the year might be a little more difficult because of the pressure in the first half of the year. When you think about the last half of the year though, in order for us to get into those upper margin ranges that we're talking about overall for Oil and Gas, it's going to require that the third and fourth quarters have margins that are much more substantial than the first half. But those margins will be very near our historical margin guidance.","We've often guided Oil and Gas as having the opportunity to be in the 9% to 12% range based upon the compliment of \u2013 contributions of large diameter pipe. As Duke said, we're seeing a large number of large diameter pipe projects moving into the last half of the year and that's what's bringing us up into that overall margin profile in the back half of the year.","Relative to longer term, that's what it is, it's the continuing contribution of a robust amount of large diameter pipe would be the primary driver moving us towards that range. And as it relates to a 2017, 2018, 2019 view, we're not going to speak to anything from a guidance perspective, but what we say is, is that when you look at the back half of this year and see how that complement is contributing so much to the margin profile that continues to be what gives us confidence overall of being able to move towards that historical 9% to 12% range.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","And I'll comment as well. From a general standpoint, our Oil and Gas, the way we bid work and the way we go about executing work has not changed. And when this cycle was in the past, we delivered these kind of margins and, I believe, we'll deliver these kind of margins in this cycle as well.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, guys. That's helpful. And then, can you separate out for us how much of the loss from the Alaska project was related to the force majeure that was claimed versus the continuing engineering production issues. The point \u2013 I think I remember you've got some of your best people now on this project and still having some issues during commissioning.","So, I think you mentioned that it would end the end of 3Q, which is kind of similar to what you said last quarter, but you also said it was 90% done, which is kind of what it was last quarter as well. So, I guess what's the risk that this sort of drags on for a little bit longer than we previously thought?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","There is three distinct issues in the quarter, all out of our control. We're not going to quantify the claim or what we are pursuing on it. It's early. We're developing it and it would be not prudent for us to kind of state what that is at this point. We're developing it.","Our main concentration is delivering the power plant to the customer, and that's what we're concentrating on right now. We believe we'll have it done in the third quarter. Again, I know we said that in the past. We still believe that based on where we're at today. We're in the commissioning phase late stages and have done some QA\/QC on delivery of the whole project.","So, again, late stages of the project. Yes, we do follow it very closely. I follow it myself very closely. So, engaged daily on where we're at. I feel like when we get it done and then commissioned, we'll start working on the assessment of the claim and where we're at there and, hopefully, be able to come back to you and let you know kind of where that's at.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","One other bit of color is that, as Duke mentioned, those three issues. Those three issues represented the substantial majority of the change in the estimate and, therefore, the substantial majority of the overall losses we've recorded this quarter, which is why you did not otherwise see a significant move in the estimates complete because all three of those items that he referenced were not currently in our control and, therefore, were not in our original estimate.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Understand. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question from William Bremer with Maxim Group.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Good morning, gentlemen.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good morning, Bill.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Bill.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Not to beat a dead horse, but if we back out this Alaskan project, your electrical margins are above 9%, right?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","That's right.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","That's right.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Yeah, so we got \u2013 okay. So, in essence, what we're seeing here is, hey, something these margins are in \u2013 are approaching your targeted range. We got one project that we're 90% complete. We're almost there. So, we understand where you're going with this.","I want to change ships a little bit here to the Oil and Gas segment. You mentioned your gathering. Can you give us an update on downstream, okay? A lot of peers are looking at very good MRO activity now and really calling out a very robust turnaround season due to the lower crack spread. What are you seeing on the downstream side? I know we've been talking a lot on mainline. I want to go a little smaller here.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah. Bill, I'd just say, in general, our business there is not material to the segment at this point. We do, do work in turnarounds and also downstream. It's the same cycle. There is delays in some part of it and some part of it is starting to move on, as you said, from a turnaround standpoint. So, we're participating in some of those and we do see the bidding activity picking up both in Canada and in the Lower 48.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Okay. Great. And just an update on integrity services and any additional MSAs in the quarter?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah, our integrity business is doing very well, again, off a lower base. It gets overshadowed by some of the larger diameter pipe, but we continue to grow that base business both on the LDC market as well as on the natural gas pipelines and oil lines.","William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. I guess a couple questions. One: Derrick, back on the guidance again, the back half of the year, the non-GAAP guidance, adjusting for all the charges implies EPS in the back half of the year of $0.55 to $0.60 a quarter, which I don't know when we've ever seen Quanta put up those types of numbers.","So, I guess my concern is that's a big number. How much cushion do you have in that? Can you still make the low-end of those two mainline pipe jobs that you're waiting on permitting if they get pushed?","And then my second question is on the \u2013 you've got the two nice projects on the large transmission side in backlog, which I think you said is another $500 million. Given that we're seeing the large transmission projects ramp again, why can't margins, as we approach 2017, get back to your targeted range of the 10% to 12%? Because your commentary historically has always been, well, its small transmission and distribution so that's why your margins were there. Are those two projects so competitively bid, that's off the table?","The third question is, you talked about receivables being pushed or something and you expect to get that back in the third quarter. Can you just give us color on how much that is and why isn't your customer paying you? Is it a dispute over a project or is it they can't? Just a little more color there. Thank you.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","There's a lot there, Jamie. Let's see if I can remember them all. Oil and Gas, the back half of the year, when you talk about from a confidence perspective as I spoke of earlier, you see the margin profile in Oil and Gas coming back up to margins that are very near our historical 9% to 12% kind of, although at the lower end.","And so to that end, I think what that shows is that despite the level of transmission work we have going on, we tried to be prudent in our level of expectations of execution to deal with the risk that there is inherent in execution of larger projects like this. And so...","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","But the question is \u2013 but the question is if those two main line pipe jobs don't go, can you at least hit the low-end of your guide?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","It's going to be largely dependent upon how we execute across the remaining portion of that work. Duke spoke of earlier that we're not going to look at that as individual isolation, because the rest of the remaining work might execute above our expectations and therefore be able to cover any shortfall or push in that revenue.","If we execute at the current level on the projects that are based upon our guidance and that project fully moves out, I think that what you'd see is we probably need to come back and look at some level of adjustment, but it's too soon to say. As it stands here today, what we have in our expectations for the year are based upon the probability that we believe we'll be able to move forward based upon our customer communications. If something changes from that, we would let you know.","Relative to the T&D margins, the reality is as we stand here today, the biggest pressure in that area is coming from the downturn of the market in Canada. If you were to look at just the non-Canadian operations, the margins in that segment are \u2013 as well as ignoring the power plant, if you will; the remaining margins are at our historical margin profile.","What is putting the pressure overall on the Electric Power group is the margins coming out of Canada. To that end, that is where, as we move forward, we're going to have two of the largest \u2013 the two largest projects the company has ever been awarded. We believe we'll be moving into full construction in 2017 and we would expect that alone to create a potential for the margin upside in Canada, which would relieve some of the pressure you're seeing overall on the margins.","So, we are seeing our ability to operate in our historical profile in the non-Canadian market as we stand here today. That's what also then gives us the confidence being able to move into that range as we move forward. What you see in backlog margins are comparable to what you've seen historically. We've not changed our bidding approach on any of the work that's out there that we are pursuing.","So, there is nothing otherwise fundamental occurring. And then lastly, on your receivables question, it's QA\/QC type work or processes. All of the stuff we have substantial dollar amounts themselves that are held up for very minor issues and it's just a matter of getting that process of QA\/QC. There isn't anything that's there that's unique. We run into that periodically and we don't anticipate anything of size or consequence to come out of the issue.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noelle Dilts of Stifel.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good morning, Noelle.","Noelle Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Hey, good morning. First question just on transmission revenues, it sounds like they came in a little bit below your expectations. We're seeing that out of some of the peers as well. I understand that the large projects are coming back. That's consistent with our expectations. But did you see a slowdown in small to medium project activity or distribution in the quarter that maybe you weren't expecting? Can you just help us understand that a little bit?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah, Noelle. Again, I think some of the \u2013 we had some fire issue there in Canada and our Canadian markets did pull back during the quarter. That was where the biggest part of the drag on the earnings were. As far as the Lower 48, things progressed basically like we thought they would. A little bit of delay in the large pipeline projects, but we expect that to turn around in the third quarter. So, similar to what we thought, yes, the margins are depressed. We had some, like I said, some issue in Canada that depressed them for the most part.","Noelle Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Can we talk a little bit just about kind of your longer-term strategy and your priorities for capital allocation? How are you thinking about acquisitions at this point versus additional buybacks? Just give us a flavor of kind of how you're thinking about just your longer-term strategy right now?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah, Noelle. We're focused on executing on the core business, I think first and foremost, safely as well as productively on the jobs that we have in backlog and we continue to work with our customers on solutions on their capital structures. So, as we look at the capital that our customers are going to spend over the next years \u2013 few years, we're just trying to provide solutions to that capital budget in our base business as well as the larger jobs. We think, based on the data that we have and what we talked to our customers about, that will bode well for us in our core business.","As we look outside our core, again, linear projects, things that our customers are going into, we move along with our customers. The M&A activity, we don't press that. It's more about is it strategic? Does it make sense? Is this something that we believe will add to our stakeholders and it is a piece of what we believe is a good source and use of capital for our stakeholders. And so, as we see it, and it makes sense and it's accretive, we would look at acquisitions, but again, we don't have anything large on our plate or anything like that other than just to say we're always inquisitive and we're always looking to add to our strategic offerings as well as geographic mixes in our core business.","Noelle Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Steve.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Good morning, Steven.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","On the pipeline, how lumpy do you expect the bookings to be going forward? This is obviously a light quarter, but we are heading into a more robust market. What kind of visibility do you have on the timing of bookings and could we see a rebound as soon as Q3 or not that soon?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah, Steve. Again, what I would say \u2013 characterize it, if you look at the way that this quarter went, if we were to early July award on one of our larger electric projects, we would have record backlog, so that alone would tell you kind of the lumpiness in that. So, yes, the projects that we're looking at are large, and so they will \u2013 bookings will get lumpy as you move forward.","I think how they go about and when they come and when we decide to fully put them in backlog will be based on a couple of things. It's also when they're going to go when they're probable to go, and so all those things that we happen to look at due to regulations and all the other things, now, it's a little bit more complicated than it has been in the past. Our Northern Pass job for example...","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Sorry. I was asking about \u2013 sorry to interrupt. I was asking pipelines, not about Electric.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Okay. Again, our pipeline is same thing, large projects in our backlog on the East Coast that we're looking at. Those that we can't put our hands on to say when they're going to start, when we have a notice to proceed or a contract, we don't put them in our backlog. We're confident that they're there. We're confident in the end markets of our businesses, but we can't \u2013 we're not going to put them in the backlog till we sign the contracts. And we can't tell you exactly when that is. So, it is lumpy. It will be lumpy.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Finally, just real quickly ask you just on Electric, what really has changed here? It sounds like for awhile you have been talking about fewer large projects and the timings are more uncertain. Now, it does seem like there has been a change. So what is it about the environment then or customer motivations or what has really made the market a better market?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","We stated in the past that some of our resources to build large transmission that we felt like we needed to hold onto those resources and it has depressed some of our margins in the past. As we move into construction on some of these larger projects, as stated, you'll start to see our margins increase. That's what you're seeing now. We're starting to get some of these larger projects and execute on them. So that will alleviate some of the margin pressure and we're pretty optimistic about that moving forward.","Our Canadian operations are depressed at this point. We do believe that stabilized. As that starts to move forward, again, the margins will move up and we're watching that with cautious optimism and Canada. But I think they're as expected and from our standpoint, we are executing good on what we have. The environment itself is robust. You can see it in the capital spend of our customers. It's all about when they go and when we can come in and say, yes, we're going to start this project. It's not about the environment itself. It's a good environment as far as I'm concerned.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann of Robert W. Baird.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Duke, I'll let you finish off what you're about to start there and talk about the update on Northern Pass, the project that's on the Electric side that you talked about having won. When can that go in backlog? You mentioned that the large projects are ramping up. Can you talk about your visibility into things like Clean Line and maybe what it means for your overall direction in the Electric backlog over the next two quarters or three quarters?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yeah, I think what I was trying to accomplish is to tell you that, overall in general, some of these projects are complicated both on gas and electric when we put in the backlog and referenced Northern Pass. So, that's complicated. And as we move through that process with our customer, which we stay in contact with all the time, and they bid into their RFP process, when they get a notice to proceed at their RFP process, then obviously, we'll stick that in backlog and give you some dates on when we're going to be in construction.","It's still moving forward as expected. Should see something in late 2017. Everything we can hear from our customer and then possibly move it into construction if they win. So, as we know, we'll put it in backlog. Some of the other merchant transmission, we follow it all. We're involved in all of them at some form or fashion for the most part. And again, when they become something that we can talk about meaningfully, we'll do that.","We do not include any of these in our \u2013 the way we think about the business until we put them in backlog. So, we're not thinking about that as we look forward in the business, and we don't comment. That's not the reason for the margins moving in Electric, for example. If that came in, it would be incremental to anything we're saying.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Just to clarify, you said Northern Pass maybe late 2017 or did you mean to say late 2016?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","No, it'd be 2017. It'd be a 2017 build and they wouldn't know till the end of 2017 to what \u2013 if they're bidding into the RFP. It's a constant process, but that's a late 2017 type situation in my mind.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from John Rogers of D.A. Davidson.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for getting me in. A couple of things, I just wanted to follow-up on. First of all, in terms of the outlook for the second half of the year and, Derrick, your comments about sounds like much stronger fourth quarter, I guess, are there project closeouts that you're looking at in the fourth quarter or is it just a ramp in activity and how much do we have to now worry about weather coming into that what seasonally is often a more difficult period?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Actually, it's nothing relative to project closeouts. It's nothing relative to any expectations of recovery of change orders and claims. It's really just the mix of work. We're going to \u2013 in our mind, we're going to have an uptick on revenues very likely between the third quarter and fourth quarter, most of that being driven by the pipeline division itself in Oil and Gas and the larger diameter pipe. So whether it be from a higher revenue and a better absorption of the costs and\/or just having the full complement of spreads moving at that point in time.","So, largely, ultimately, the mix of the work that's happening is what's driving a little bit of that uptick and we have seen fourth quarter margins be higher than the third quarter in the past. For us, our typical seasonality is that you have a little bit of weather effect in the fourth quarter, absent anything influencing that. In this particular case, what's influencing that is that large diameter mix of work. That's why we think that it will have a slight margin uptick.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And also, revenue uptick as well, is that what you're saying?","Derrick A. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Yeah. Okay. And then, Duke, just back to the bidding environment out there, and with projects being pushed out, particularly on the pipeline side, and you're saying that pricing still looks like it will be what we've seen in the past and margin potential is still there. But I would surmise that with delays in the market that in excess capacity the bidding would get more competitive, but you're not seeing that on large projects? Is that what you're saying?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","It's more about where the products, what kind of constraints you have from a standpoint to build them. Some projects are easier than others. We're seeing get lumped up into different years, different parts of years. So as those things \u2013 we take those things into account, it's just the industry itself and us evaluating when they go.","As we said in our comments, I do think that the market in large pipeline is longer and it's not a boom and bust type thing, because everyone has continued to push a bit. It's just a longer cycle for permitting than it has been in the past. And normally, on naturally gas, what was a fairly easy process, with the states getting involved it has created another level of complexity to get them permitted.","We're all working through that. You're starting to see some permits go through. I do believe as we move forward, it will get ironed out, it always does, and we'll get things moving. So, we're starting to understand that a little better. As far as competitive level, some of the work that we're looking at is core to what we're doing in our natural gas segment long-haul pipe and we're very well positioned in that market. So, we're not seeing that to be an issue.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - President, Chief Executive Officer, COO & Director","Yes, first, I'd like to comment just in general that we're confident in our ability to execute in our business and we do think the end markets are robust and we'll continue to strive to deliver on earnings.","Thank you for participating in our call. We appreciate your questions and ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you. This concludes our call","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Jim?","James F. O'Neil","Thank you, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with an operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter and full year results. Following Derrick's comments, we will welcome your questions.","We are pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter and record results for the full year of 2013. We ended the year with record revenues, record operating income, record earnings per share, record adjusted earnings per share and record 12-month and total backlog, to name a few. It is noteworthy that our 2013 accomplishments compared to our prior year's performance, which included unusually high levels of emergency restoration revenues and income, primarily associated with Hurricane Sandy.","This morning, we announced our financial outlook for the full year of 2014, with a revenue range of $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion, and a diluted earnings per share range of $1.65 to $1.85. Clearly, we expect momentum to continue in our end markets as we see continued opportunity for double-digit growth for at least the next 2 years. We continue to believe that we are in unprecedented times, not only in Quanta's history, but in the history of the electric power in oil and gas industries. Our electric utility customers continue to invest in the power grid, deploying capital at record levels to address reliability challenges and regulatory mandates. As a result, investments are being made to replace aging infrastructure and to interconnect transmission in substation facilities with renewable generation and to modify transmission enter [ph] as coal generation plants all retired and replaced with natural gas generation.","We are also seeing upgrades to distribution networks as distributed generation, demand response and other technologies are deployed. Quanta is the largest electric power specialty contractor in North America and we provide services to the majority of utilities in the United States and Canada. In many cases, we have firsthand knowledge of our customers' capital programs. Our internal research into several of our major utility clients indicates continued record investment in transmission with up to 15% annual growth in capital expenditures through 2017. The electric power infrastructure initiatives I spoke of earlier will take years to play out and hundreds of billions of dollars of investment. We believe Quanta is uniquely-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.","","Electric Power segment revenues rose to record levels in 2013 and operating margins were strong considering we performed approximately $140 million less storm work in 2013 compared to the prior year.","Demand for our day-to-day transmission, substation distribution and other electric power services remains strong, and we do not anticipate any slowdown in activity for the foreseeable future. Further, we are experiencing increasing demand for our proprietary Energized Services technology as customers are choosing to re-conduct their existing transmission infrastructure in an energized state, either because the line cannot be taken out of service or additional right-of-way to construct a parallel line cannot be secured. Developing additional resources for energized capability is one of the major catalysts for building our state-of-the-art training facility in La Grange, Texas. Overall, our intent to is to ensure that we continue to have a trained and qualified workforce to provide technical solutions to our customers' ever growing needs.","In addition to our day-to-day Electric Power transmission and distribution activity, we have also experienced an increase in large project awards in our electric segment. Over the last 3 months, we have been awarded, in aggregate, over $650 million of projects that are individually valued in excess of $100 million. This includes transmission projects in Canada for AltaLink and Nalcor, additional major segments of the Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project for Southern California Edison, and an EPC contract for a combined cycle thermal power plant in Alaska for Anchorage Municipal Light & Power.","We believe our current backlog in the Electric Power segment, coupled with project opportunities on the horizon provide double-digit growth opportunities.","Today, we are announcing a change in the name of our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment to better align with our expanded service offerings and growing customer base in this segment. Going forward, this segment has been renamed the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment. No change has been made to the segment's financial results. Our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment revenues grew over 20% in 2013. Perhaps more importantly, operating income more than doubled. We believe the market for our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services will remain dynamic in 2014. As you are aware, the unconventional shales in the Canadian oilsands are reshaping the North America energy market. As unconventional as these -- geology as the geology is in these formations, their geographic locations are unconventional as well. As a result, hundreds of billions of dollars could be spent over the next several decades on new infrastructure required to gather and move hydrocarbons to markets throughout North America. Main line and gathering system construction activity has been ramping up over the last 2.5 years. Our pipeline-gathering activity remains active and we experienced acceleration in demand for our mainline pipe construction services in 2013, having booked more than $700 million in contracts in the second half of last year. By the beginning of 2015, we believe customer demand to install pipeline infrastructure will likely outpace the industry's construction resources.","As the largest pipeline construction company in North America, we have the largest employee base and equipment fleet in our industry. We have the reputation, track record and customer relationships that position us to be an important participant in this historic time in the North American energy market.","In our view, Australia, too, is one of the most dynamic energy markets in the world. We believe we have entered Australia at the right time to expand our service offerings in what we believe will be an attractive energy market for years to come.","We see continued opportunities to book additional mainline projects in the United States, Canada and Australia in 2014 and beyond. Although our gas distribution and integrity services are a smaller portion of our overall Oil and Gas segment revenues, we see continued opportunities to deploy our services as customers seek to comply with requirements regulating pipeline safety. Like our Electric Power segment, we see double-digit growth opportunities for our Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment, and we expect continued improvement in operating margins as we capitalize on these projects throughout 2014.","Now let's transition to our Fiber Optic Licensing segment. Today, we are announcing an expansion of our service offerings in our Fiber Optic Licensing business. This business has principally been focused on providing dark fiber or providing fiber optic capacity to customers in various market verticals without lighting up the fiber. We are now expanding our offerings to include lit services. Under the lit services model, not only do we provide access to the extensive fiber networks that we own, we also provide advanced networking equipment and responsible for network management and service quality. As we deploy our lit service strategy, our initial investment in people and equipment to support the lit service platform will negatively impact margins in 2014. In the midterm, margins will decline slightly in the segment as lit services generate lower margins than dark fiber. However, we believe increased revenue opportunities will more than offset the margin decline once the lit strategy is fully developed by 2016. We are enthusiastic about our lit service expansion as the lit service market is significantly larger than the dark fiber market and offers significant growth opportunity. Equally important, the lit service market enables us to more fully utilize our existing dark fiber network, while providing more robust network service offerings to existing and potential customers.","There is a continued appetite for fiber bandwidth for business continuity, cloud computing, data center connectivity and private wide area network services. We continue to invest in our networks to expand our service offerings to meet customer demand and to capitalize on new opportunities in the marketplace.","In summary, we had another excellent year and believe 2014 could be another record year for Quanta. We believe momentum continues to build in all of our end markets, with opportunity for double-digit growth in 2014 and 2015. As Electric Power and Oil and Gas Infrastructure projects get larger and more complex, more customers are turning to Quanta to provide comprehensive infrastructure solutions. We believe we have the scope and scale, the technology, the expertise and the track record that differentiates us in the markets we serve. We continue to execute on strategies that differentiate Quanta and position the company for near and long-term growth.","","I want to highlight that our achievements would not have been possible without the skill, dedication and hard work of nearly 21,000 employees. I want to thank our employees for their commitment to safety and project execution. We have the very best employees in the industry, and they are the key to our past and future success.","I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his financial review of the fourth quarter and the year. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.82 billion for the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to $1.67 billion in the prior year's fourth quarter, reflecting consolidated growth of approximately 9% quarter-over-quarter. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the quarter was $166.7 million or $0.77 per diluted share, as compared to $102.4 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of last year. Included in net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2013 was the after-tax gain of $70.5 million or approximately $0.32 per diluted share from the sale of our equity ownership interest in Howard Energy on December 6, 2013.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as calculated in today's press release, was $0.50 for the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to $0.51 for the fourth quarter of 2012. The growth in consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter of 2013 was primarily due to a 28.4% increase in revenues from our Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment and, to a lesser extent, by a 2.1% increase in revenues from our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. Our consolidated gross margin was 16.7% in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2012. This decrease in gross margin was primarily a result of the quarter-over-quarter decrease in higher-margin emergency restoration service revenues, partially offset by the impact of higher overall revenues across our segment.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were $143.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting an increase of $26.4 million as compared to last year's fourth quarter. This increase is primarily attributable to $14.3 million in incremental administrative cost from recently acquired companies, and $11.8 million in higher salary and incentive compensation costs associated with increased levels of operating activity and profitability. Also contributing to the overall increase in selling general and adversative expenses was approximately $2.9 million in higher acquisition and integration costs in 4Q '13 associated with the acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014.","As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 7.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 from 7% in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to the impact of the items previously discussed.","Our consolidated operating margin before amortization expense was 8.8% in 4Q '13 compared to 10.1% in 4Q '12, also due primarily to the 4Q '12 record level of emergency restoration services.","Amortization of intangible assets increased from $8.9 million in 4Q '12 to $10.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to amortization of additional intangible assets associated with the 2013 acquisitions.","To further discuss our segment results, the Electric Power segment's revenues were $1.2 billion, reflecting an increase of $25.3 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 2.1%. Revenues were positively impacted by increased capital spending for our customers for both transmission and distribution projects, as well as the contribution of approximately $56.1 million in revenues from companies acquired in 2013. Growth in this segment outpaced a quarter-over-quarter decrease in emergency restoration service revenues of $97.7 million from record levels of $130.5 million in Q4 '12 to approximately $32.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.","For the Electric Power segment, 12-month and total backlog increased from 2012 year-end, as well as sequentially from the third quarter of 2013. 12-month backlog increased 15% and total backlog for the segment increased by 12% to a record $5.96 billion from the third quarter of 2013. Excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter, this segment experienced double-digit backlog growth from incremental transmission awards and the renewal of certain master service agreements when comparing to the third quarter of 2013. Operating margin in the Electric Power segment was 12.1% in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to 13.4% in last year's fourth quarter, again, primarily due to the lower levels of higher-margin storm work in the current period.","Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by 28.4% to $572.4 million in 4Q '13, primarily as a result of approximately $111.7 million in revenues generated by the companies acquired in 2013. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2013 were also favorably impacted by increased revenues from the contribution of certain mainline pipe project as compared to no mainline work in last year's fourth quarter, as well as projects related to unconventional shale developments in certain regions of North America.","Operating income for the Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment as a percentage of revenues increased to 8.9% in 4Q '13 from 6.2% in 4Q '12. This increase is due primarily to continued successful project execution, the additional contribution of mainline activity, as well as the overall increase in segment revenues, which improved the segment's ability to cover fixed and overhead costs.","12-month backlog for the Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment at year-end increased, as compared to 3Q '13, primarily due to backlog associated with acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, from new awards that replaced work that was completed during the fourth quarter, while total backlog was relatively constant. When compared to the end of 2012, total backlog increased 41.6%, primarily due to increases in mainline pipe project awards, along with the contribution from companies acquired in 2013. Also, as we've commented before, Keystone XL is not in any of the backlog figures presented for our Oil and Gas Infrastructure segment.","Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment revenues were down $7.4 million or 15.5% to $40.3 million in 4Q '13 as compared to $47.8 million in 4Q '12 due to lower levels of ancillary telecommunication service revenues as certain larger projects completed in the prior year did not -- that did not recur to the same extent in 2013.","Operating margin was 25.1% in 4Q '13 as compared to 34% in 4Q '12, primarily as a result of a $3.2 million charge associated with gross receipts taxes on Fiber Optic Licensing revenues in certain state jurisdictions. For some time, we have been monitoring a court case of another large service provider, and based upon findings in that case, we have concluded that our historical position may no longer be sustainable and we are amending our tax filings in this state accordingly. This charge is cumulative effect of the change in position, and we anticipate that in the future, much of this tax will likely be passed through to our customers and will therefore have a minimal effect on future margins.","When calculating operating margins by segment, we do not allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization expense to our segments. Therefore, the previous discussion about operating margins by segment excludes the effects of such expense.","Corporate and unallocated costs increased to 16 -- increased $16.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to 4Q '12, primarily as a result of $11.5 million in higher salary and incentive compensation costs associated with current levels of operating activity and profitability, $2.9 million in higher acquisition and integration costs, and a net $1.2 million increase in amortization expense related to 2013 acquisitions, partially offset by previously acquired intangible assets that became fully amortized.","EBITA for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $268.2 million or 14.8% of revenues, compared to $166.8 million or 10% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was $202.8 million or 11.2% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to $203.8 million or 12.2% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2012. For the 12 months ended 2013, adjusted EBITDA was $712.1 million or 10.9% of revenues, compared to $635.3 million or 10.7% of revenues for 2012. The calculation of EBITA, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, all non-GAAP measures, and the definitions of these in days sales outstanding or DSOs can be found in the Investors and Media section of our website at quantaservices.com.","As we commented in our last earnings call, our guidance for the quarter included our expectations for certain tax contingency releases for the quarter. Our results for the fourth quarter of 2013 and 2012 included the release of income tax contingencies of approximately $3.5 million and $2.7 million of income, or a net benefit of $0.02 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2013 and a net benefit of $0.01 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2012 due to the expiration of various statutes of limitations periods and settlements of certain income tax audits.","For the full year of 2013, cash flow from operation of about $447 million less net capital expenditures of about $249 million resulted in approximately $198 million of positive free cash flow as compared to negative free cash flow of approximately $30 million for the full year of 2012.","The fourth quarter of 2013 has free cash flow of approximately $157 million, which contributed to the overall year and was driven by reduced DSOs. Our DSOs were 72 days at December 31, 2013, 82 days at September 30, 2013, and 82 days at December 31, 2012. Contributing to the decrease in DSOs from September 30 were certain large [indiscernible] collections, as well as growth in advance billing position. Contributing to the decrease in DSOs from December 31, 2012 was the favorable impact of 9 days from reclassifying the previously disclosed change order receivable balance of $165 million on the Sunrise Powerlink project from current assets to other long-term assets.","Other noteworthy investing activities during the fourth quarter of 2013 include the sale of all of our equity interest in Howard Energy for after-tax net proceeds of approximately $177.5 million and the closing of 3 acquisitions for aggregate consideration of $245 million, including the use of approximately $176 million in cash.","At December 31, 2013, we had about $240 million in letters of credit outstanding, primarily to secure our insurance program, and we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $489 million in cash, with approximately $237 million in U.S. funds and $252 million of this balance relating to our foreign operations. Considering our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we had nearly $1.57 billion in total liquidity as of December 31, 2013.","As Jim previously commented, subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, we completed 5 additional acquisitions for aggregate combined consideration of approximately $116.5 million, of which approximately $79.9 million was paid with cash on hand, a large portion of which was Canadian bonds.","Concerning our outlook for 2014, we expect revenues for the first quarter of '14 to range between $1.65 billion and $1.75 billion, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be $0.36 to $0.38 on a GAAP basis. These estimates compare to revenues of $1.59 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.34 in the first quarter of 2013.","Our GAAP EPS forecast for the first quarter of 2014 includes an estimate of $7.8 million for noncash stock-based compensation expense and $8.2 million for amortization expense. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2014 is expected to be $0.41 to $0.43, in comparison to $0.38 in the first quarter of 2013.","We expect the revenues for the full year 2014 to range between $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be $1.65 to $1.85 on a GAAP basis.","Our GAAP EPS forecast for 2014 includes an estimate of $35.3 million for noncash stock-based compensation expense and $33.1 million of amortization expense. Excluding these expenses and others, comparable to our historical calculations, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2014 is expected to be between $1.85 and $2.05, which compares to $1.71 in 2013.","Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release. We are currently forecasting net income attributable to noncontrolling interests to be approximately $3.5 million to $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2014, and $12 million to $13 million for the year. For additional guidance, we are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate to be between 34.5% and 35.5% for 2014, and our diluted share count to be about 219.6 million shares.","We expect CapEx for all of 2014 to be approximately $300 million to $325 million, which includes CapEx for our Fiber Licensing and Other segment of about $50 million to $60 million. This compares to CapEx from continuing operations for all of 2013 of $264 million.","We also had several other financially oriented events and accomplishments in 2013. We continue to leverage our balance sheet strength over the course of the year to win work and provide a significant working capital to our operations to fund the simultaneous ramp-up of a number of large projects, while ultimately maintaining a strong balance sheet, leaving us well-positioned for continued internal growth and strategic initiatives. In consideration of these growth opportunities, Quanta's acquisition strategy and continued approach to leveraging our balance sheet on larger scale infrastructure projects, we amended our revolving credit facility in the fourth quarter to increase our availability under the facility to $1.325 billion and extended the maturity date to October 30, 2018, while increasing our flexibility and decreasing our pricing.","Also in the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to $500 million of Quanta's common stock through December of 2016. Overall, our capital priorities remain the same with a focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital and capital expenditure growth and an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions, investment and repurchases of stock.","2013 was another exceptional year for Quanta. We ended the year with numerous record-breaking achievements. As Jim commented, we continue to execute within all of our segments, and we believe that we are operationally and financially well-positioned for continued solid growth in '14 and beyond. This concludes our formal presentation, and I'll now turn the line for a quick Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tahira Afzal from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Saagar Parikh - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","This is actually Saagar on for Tahira. My first question is related to your Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment. Jim, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you guys booked $700 million in long haul work in the second half of '14. Is that on top of the $550 million in long-haul work that you guys announced on the second quarter in the -- for the second quarter?","James F. O'Neil","No, that $550 million -- well, we actually didn't announce -- the $550 million is in the $700 million. And that came in the second -- that's right, and that announcement on that pipeline backlog was on our second quarter call in August. So that is inclusive of the $700 million.","Saagar Parikh - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So when we look at it, you probably have around $600 million of long-haul work going into 2014 versus maybe $100 million of long-haul work going into 2013?","James F. O'Neil","I would say, directionally, that's correct.","Saagar Parikh - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So overall, with those numbers, could you talk a little bit about just in terms of the bidding environment and the recent headline news around Keystone? What your pipeline capacity utilization maybe was in 2013? What is expected right now in '14? And then what's really available with or without Keystone looking into '15?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I think we were only onto 2 to 3 spreads of mainline pipe at any given time in '13, so we've got the ability to flex up to 9 to 12. So we've got plenty of capacity both to pursue gathering work and mainline pipe. We're well-positioned for the ramp up. We do expect that the mainline pipe market will accelerate as we move into '14, certainly in the second half of '14 and into '15, with or without Keystone.","Operator","Your next question comes from Will Gabrielski from Stephens.","Will Gabrielski - Stephens Inc.","Can you talk about the -- so you provided what sounds like it's a multiyear 15% CAGR target for the electric business, if I heard you correctly. And you also talked very bullishly about Energized Services. So do you think that's the fastest-growing part of that 15%? And can you just talk about what the margins in Energized Services looks like versus the rest of your electric business?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I would say that the Energized Services today while a very important and strategic part of our business, is not material to the overall transmission revenue opportunities that we see in '14 and '15. That's going to be primarily new construction of lines which don't require our Energized Services capabilities, and that market is going to be very active, we believe, as we go through '14 and into '15, throughout '15 as well.","Will Gabrielski - Stephens Inc.","Okay. And then as a follow-up, looking at the pipeline market and the your commentary around the demand for resources outstripping the supply of contractor capacity as we look into '15, you did a lot of work pre this transmission boom, if I remember correctly, training and making sure your equipment was in place. Can you talk about how far along you are? How much more needs to be done, whether it's training or spending, to get ready for that level of capacity demand in the pipeline market?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, we're well-prepared for any uptick in mainline pipe. And our field leadership, our superintendents and foremen are exchangeable. They can do the work on gathering oil and mainline pipes. So we're well-positioned for any increase in activity in mainline for the next 2 years.","Derrick A. Jensen","Will, this is Derrick. Also, I want to come back and address the -- relative to the 15%, I mean, there's an aspect of acquisitions in 2014, the full year effect of our '13 revenues, so not all of that is organic as far as the 15%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Rygiel from FBR Capital Markets.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Jim, could you give us a little bit more qualitative sort of commentary about pricing and margins that you expect over the next 12 months within the electrical segment? Obviously, margins were very strong in the fourth quarter and recognizing, obviously, there were some weather impact there. But qualitatively, can you just sort of comment on where we stand on pricing and margins for electrical over the next 12 months?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I think when you look at our backlog and margins in backlog, that's the best indicator of margins going forward. And our margins in backlog are comparable or better than what we're experiencing today on a consolidated basis, in both electric and natural gas in our Oil and Gas segment. Our margins should be improving as we ramp up activity...","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Great. And a follow-up question. As we look at your pipe margins of 8.9% in the fourth quarter, which is very strong both sequentially and year-over-year, can you help us understand if there was any sort of negative weather impact on that business in the fourth quarter? And sort of what your thoughts are with regards to weather outlook in the first quarter for pipe?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, Alex, this is Derrick. Yes, relative to the fourth quarter, I mean, we have pretty decent weather allowing us to continue to execute. It's not uncommon for the fourth quarter for us to have a kind of a downtick in margins, so that's why you see a little bit of downtick. And I would continue to expect that fourth quarter dynamic next year. Relative to the first quarter, we definitely have weather effects more likely in pipe than in Electric Power. So I would expect that similar to the last few years, you'd have a lower margin profile in the first quarter. Having said that, I do expect that we'll still yet have a better margin performance within the Oil and Gas segment in the first quarter '14 than we saw in '13. I also want to go back to kind of the overall margins for Electric Power. When we consider margins for Electric Power in our guidance right now, we've kind of looked at more of a 10% to 12% range. We kind of raised the bottom end of -- from 9 -- from a 9% to 12% to kind of now a 10% to 12%. And I'd look for Electric Power right now to probably be somewhere in the midpoint of that as we think about for 2014.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Wondering if you can help with your expected revenue mix in 2014. Earn rates over the last few years would imply around $4.9 billion for Electric Power and maybe $2.9 billion for the oil and gas segment, which would already be at the high end of the guidance range, which makes me think that the pipeline -- or the oil and gas would be lower than that. I mean, are we thinking is it 15% for Electric Power in 2014? Maybe just help with the mix a little bit there.","Derrick A. Jensen","I do think that you'll see the opportunity for a little bit of a higher growth relative to the pipeline side versus Electric Power. What we've considered in our overall guidance is the upper end of the range considers the double-digit growth rate for either Electric Power and pipeline. But I think that the pipeline does have a component of opportunity for slightly higher growth rate than the Electric Power in total.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then can you talk about how you expect the Canadian market to evolve over the next year or 2? And how might the next projects and bidding be different from the work you've seen ramping up over the last year or 2? And what did the most recent acquisitions in January do for you in that business and marketplace?","James F. O'Neil","Well, the acquisitions that we made in Canada here recently just help support the overall uptick in opportunities that we have in Canada. It helps build our geographical presence in Canada. Canada has some significant opportunities, but so does the U.S. So -- and I don't want to get lost at Canada. Canada's where all the growth is. I mean, we have significant opportunities and are executing on large opportunities in the U.S. today. But we think that Canada and U.S. both grow as a percentage equally over time. Right now, we're probably seeing a little bit more increase in Canada, but we'll certainly see some U.S. opportunities in the future as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess 2 questions. First, Derrick, as it relates to your guidance for this year, I mean, if we were sitting here last year, I think on a non-GAAP basis, you guided $1.23 to $1.53, and you came in this year at $1.71, which was almost $0.20 better than what you -- $0.20 better than the high-end. So I guess, as I think about your guidance for this year, you're closer to The Street than you usually are. Is there any different approach in your guidance? Were you more conservative last year because you were more worried about the Oil and Gas biz not hitting the margin numbers? I'm just trying to get a feel for the potential for upside in 2014 just as we think about how well you did in 2013. Then my second question just relates to the investment that you're making in lit services. Can you just sort of talk about what you think the market opportunity is for you guys in that business? And just a little bit more color on the level of investment that you'll have to make between now and '16 and how potentially big that business could be for you.","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure. Relative to '14, I mean, or the approach to guidance in '14 versus '13, I think one of the differences in '14 right now, as we commented a second ago, we came into '13 and guided at 9% to 12% for Electric Power, and now, we're kind of leaning towards a 10% to 12% range based upon our ability to continue to execute within the last few years. And so kind of the midpoint of that would be around 11% versus last year. We -- I think we were guiding at a midpoint of 10.5%. And then -- but probably another component of that is the overall pipeline. Last year, we had limited visibility still. But as we go into 2014, we see greater visibility based upon the dialogues we've had over the last few years and we've been talking about that for the last 18 months or so. So with the greater amount of backlog and visibility in pipe, we continue to see the ability to have a higher margin profile in pipe approaching the high-end of our range, our 9% to 12% guidance. 9% at the high-end of our range right now. Relative to the fiber side of the business, I'll answer the last part and let Jim talk about the business side. From a CapEx perspective, we see fiber being about $50 million to $60 million, which is higher than what we've seen. That includes components of getting ready to approach the lit fiber side of the business. There's a reasonable amount of CapEx associated with just that implementation. As we look at '15 and '16, I think we'll actually see that start to trend back down into something maybe in the $40 million to $45 million range. And that maybe a little bit lower than what we've seen in the past in pure dark fiber because the lit fiber component is less capital intensive...","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But I guess, Derrick, my point would be you have greater -- to your -- everything you just said, you have greater visibility as you're sitting here this year versus last year, and this year you blew away your numbers. So the point would be is there is -- as you're sitting here this year, there's probably just as much room for potential upside just given how much -- just given your visibility that you have this year and the turnaround that you've seen the Oil and Gas side.","Derrick A. Jensen","The hedge, I'd say is that a lot of our backlog right now in the mainline side is in the front half of this year, which is where we have more of the weather effects. And so we think we need to get through and see how those weather effects come into play relative to what we'd expect in our ability to execute on mainline. And then at the same time, we have a degree of uncommitted in that mainline at the high-end of our range and we'll need to see how that fills through, and the timing of that relative to the overall year.","James F. O'Neil","Jamie, to answer your strategic rationale for moving into lit services, I mean, we have one of the more unique networks, particularly in the New Jersey-Pennsylvania area, and we have opportunities to expand to existing customers who desire to move into lit services. It's really no different than our Electric Power and Oil and Gas business where we try to advance our solutions with customers. There's been a big consolidation of fiber companies, as many of you are aware. Many of those are going, standardizing their services. You've got many customers that want customized services, especially those that have private networks, so that provides a big opportunity for us to get into this market in a big way. And the main thing, too, is that it's allowing us to leverage an asset, our dark fiber assets, to better utilize that asset to bring better returns to our shareholders over the long term. So that's the strategic rationale for moving into lit service.","Operator","The next question comes from Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank.","Jerimiah Booream-Phelps - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Jerimiah Booream on the line for Vishal. I was just hoping we could follow up on the pipeline segment and, specifically, the cadence of new awards this year. It sounds like you guys are pretty bullish in 2015. Do you think that we could see new awards outside of the traditional bidding season? Or is it going to be in line with other years?","James F. O'Neil","Well, like we've said in the past, the bidding season has really changed over the last 3 years, where, because of the level of activity that our customers expect over the next 3 or 4 years, many want to sit down in advance and talk about their capital programs. Not only as the industry, construction industry resources becoming tight, the programs are becoming bigger. Customer programs are becoming larger and it requires a different type of dialogue. So there's more negotiations, more discussions with customers. So that gives us the visibility Derrick talks about, and that's why we believe that '15, the end of '14 and '15, we'll see a ramp in mainline. And not necessarily a bid season, it's just an ongoing process year-round that we're going through with our customers.","Jerimiah Booream-Phelps - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And also, just on the transmission side, it also sounds like you're doing pretty well there. But just wanted to touch on large versus small transmission. And you've talked in the past about some of the -- a shift to small transmission. But with the recent awards, could you see a lot more larger projects pick up as well?","James F. O'Neil","I would say that our small transmission, which we define as projects individually less than $100 million, the pace of that activity, even with our recent awards on large projects, is very similar. It keeps pace. And I do want to remind everybody that in our total electric segment, probably small transmission is the biggest contributor to that segment. So it's a very important part of our business and it continues to ramp up as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Andy Wittmann from Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to dig a little bit into the pipeline segment. Jim, thinking back 1 year, 2 years, I think the secular themes behind the energy build out have been strong. You guys have been bullish for a while. We're starting to see some early signs here. But it still kind of sounds, from some of your comments, that while you're up on some mainline work now that -- and there's an expectation that's built in the guidance from some of your commentary that the back half of the year might be when some of the larger awards come in. First of all, I guess, am I hearing that correctly? And can you just talk about what it's going to take for some of that stuff to break loose? Is it just time? Maybe an update on the regulatory and environmental permitting processes and some of the things you're looking at. And just some color around what needs to happen for those projects to go forward would be helpful.","James F. O'Neil","Well, you have to remember that the seasonality in mainline pipe really doesn't change. I mean, our customers prefer to build mainline pipe in the second and third quarter and into the early fourth quarter or they get into potential weather issues. So that's normally when you start seeing increased activity. So that tends to get -- make it back end-loaded. And then the second question -- what was the second?","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","If there's anything holding you back -- is there anything holding back? Is it project economics? Is it permitting, the FERC, what have you? Is there something going on that might be slowing it down?","James F. O'Neil","No, it's the normal process. I mean, projects are becoming longer, they're -- in miles and in size. So the permitting process is consistent, but it just takes longer because of the sheer size of these projects. I also want to add on my earlier comment that Canada does provide some aspect of counter-cyclicality to that seasonality, which is why -- one of the reasons why our first quarter margins can tend to be higher than what they've been historically if we can execute because a lot -- there's a lot of pipeline activity in the northern climb. So you do have some aspect of that U.S. seasonality and pipeline that's offset by some our Canadian activity on pipeline as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the large transmission market in the U.S. I'm kind of under the impression that the bidding activity for large transmission might ramp in '14, and that you might see a re-acceleration of the large transmission work in '15. Is that at all accurate?","James F. O'Neil","All we can tell you, I mean we are probably closer to most of the -- most of our utility customers throughout -- most of the utilities throughout North America, and that we see a continued ramp in activity. Now you're going to have some quarters where you don't get awards, you're going to have that quarter-over-quarter cyclicality in announcements. But overall, we see a continued acceleration of electric transmission for 2015. We don't see the cyclicality that a lot of you guys see in some of these industry publications and so forth. And so that's the best way to describe it.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Got it. And then I wanted to ask about the acquisitions. Generally, I mean, lots of deals back half of last year and also in January. What kind of accretion are you baking in from those deals in 2014 guidance? And then also just on the buyback, what are your thoughts on putting that to work?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, this Derrick. From an accretion standpoint, I mean, we strive to make all of our acquisitions accretive transactions depending upon the timing of how those deals close. As an example, the fourth quarter deals in the fourth quarter were actually slightly dilutive. But overall for 2014, I would say that they are a component of that and they're slightly accretive. All the acquisitions themselves have a margin profile that are comparable to our historical business, but there -- it's partially offset by the amortization that comes in and the transaction costs themselves. And then what was your second question? Oh, stock buyback. On the stock buyback, as it stands right now, the biggest driver of that for us, is what we see on the opportunistic acquisition and investment side of the equation, that where we see continued acquisitions and investments and the need for capital there, that will really drive the big portion of what we do from a stock perspective, a stock buyback perspective.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Irwin from Wedbush Securities.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Jim, I was hoping you might be able to update us on your number spreads now relative to the industry and whether or not you think you might be able to split a couple of those moving into '15. And then historically, when you bought Price Gregory, right, we were coming off the back end of a cycle, not as strong as it sounds like the one that you're looking at '15 and probably '16 as well, but their operating performance was materially better than the target model you played out for this business. I was hoping you could maybe discuss for us a little bit whether or not you would take a philosophical approach of just not gouging customers executing on the work growing as much as you can, or if there's potential for execution above the target model as we see '15 unfold.","James F. O'Neil","Well, there's several questions in there. I mean, I'll tell you that we don't report Price Gregory's profitability separate. We report the segment's profitability, which has other services in there; gas distribution is one and gathering work. So the segment revenues in the 9% to 12% range, target range, certainly could have contributions from Price Gregory that are comparable to what they did in the later -- the previous to us acquiring it. We're also mitigating some of the risk through contract terms, and sometimes, you'll take -- you got to weigh taking 100 basis points less to mitigate a lot of risk, which you guys have seen in the past, some the project execution and risk that we've taken in the past, and we've done a great job mitigating that over the last several years and to profitability. We've been very -- we've been consistently profitable in that segment for the last 2 years. The other questions about the amount of spreads and our ability to execute, we've got plenty of capacity. We're not concerned about having capacity to capitalize on opportunities that come up through the end of this year and in '15 and beyond on mainline pipe.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs.","Brian K. Lee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, first off, it seems like there's a slightly lower earnings growth implied in the 2014 guidance versus revenue at the midpoint. So I was just wondering, is that something below the line or maybe a mix issue that's impacting margins? If you could help reconcile that a bit, it'd be great.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, I mean, basically, it comes back to us trying to put a little bit of prudency into our margin guidance. But basically, it's to address execution risk. As we think about the Electric Power, I'd say that we're in 10% to 12% operating margin and probably looking for something in the midpoint of that in our current guidance. And on the pipeline side, at the high-end, we think maybe a 9%. But other than that, it factors in the typical type of weather impacts and execution risk you have potentially there in the pipeline. So it's the combination of those things that are factored into our 2014 expectation right now.","Brian K. Lee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. Second question was just on Electric Power. I was wondering how do you expect mix from Canada to trend here versus the run rate you've seen historically and in 2013? I know Jim touched upon it a bit, but wondering if you can elaborate a bit more. And then secondarily, if there's any impact that it would have on the segment margins.","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure. I mean, we see Canada as continued opportunity. We think that Canada will have growth and solid growth, double-digit type opportunity growth. But we see the same type of thing happening in the U.S. So although Canada as a percentage, may grow a little bit more because it's a smaller level of revenue, the overall opportunities are somewhat comparable between the 2. And then from a margin perspective, we see Canada margins being comparable to our U.S. margins.","Operator","The next question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","All right. First question. Can you give us an update on the Gulf region? We're hearing a lot in terms of just the Gulf magnitude of the buildout of the next few years, and how are you guys situating yourself there? Second question is an update on Integrity, the projects there, the length of them, and has that truly picked up or what you see in there? And then finally, just on the corporate -- this is just a housekeeping question, on the corporate expense line, could you just give us a figure of sort of a run rate to utilize going forward?","James F. O'Neil","Well, let me address your Integrity question first because I think it's an umbrella over the Gulf and what we're seeing on land. I mean, Integrity continues to ramp that business as our customers comply with regulation to -- for pipeline safety. I'll tell you that it is a smaller portion of the segment, but its ability to grow as a percentage of its own base is probably greater than any other part of our business. That takes us to offshore. Integrity programs with the BSEE and SEMS regulations that are out to comply with pipeline safety, as well as platform safety. That is an area that we feel is a significant opportunity for us, and we position ourselves to take advantage of those opportunities. We're just providing an engineering program management technology solution to our pipeline identification, remediation of pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico. Derrick, you can...","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, and as far as the corporate and unallocated, I think the way I look at that is that it's going to fluctuate based upon the seasonality impact of revenues. But overall for '14, I'm going to say, in the 2.5% to 2.9% range, with a fluctuating [indiscernible] based upon that revenue fluctuation.","Operator","The next question comes from Noelle Dilts from Stifel.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","First question. There hasn't been a lot of comment -- commentary on electric distribution. I'm curious to know what you're hearing from your utility customers in terms of the spending plans for 2014 and what your thoughts are on continued -- a continued shift towards outsourcing in.","James F. O'Neil","Electric distribution has grown at double-digit revenue rates for the last 3 years, and we don't see that trend slowing down. Customers are focused on either storm hardening programs or they are modernizing the grid for demand response, smart grid, DG programs. So we continue to see the level of activity and distribution increase. And for the first time in many years, we're seeing housing starts become more material and could have a positive impact on our business story. It will have a positive impact on our distribution business this year if it continues to ramp as we expect.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then my second question, I just want to circle back to the pipeline -- or I'm sorry, oil and gas now, but the guidance there. So it sounds like if you compare -- on the revenue side, if you compare to how you guided last year, heading into '13, you were really not forecasting any new pipeline project wins aside from what you already had in backlog and then flattish growth in the existing business this year. Derrick, it sounds like on the high-end, you are including some unallocated project activity. Can you maybe put some numbers around that? What you'd have to book to really hit that high end of guidance?","James F. O'Neil","Noelle, this is Jim. I would say that yes, the one big difference, and Derrick mentioned, is we do have some aspect of uncommitted mainline on the high end of our guidance. And I would just tell you that, that number, which I don't want to get into and quantify it, but that number will allow us the opportunity to achieve double-digit growth in this segment.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Mannes from Avondale.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","A couple of follow-up questions. First, on Oil and Gas, certainly heard your dialogue as it relates kind of an abnormal bidding and the tightening of capacity that's coming and getting more severe in '15. Enbridge has certainly been on record talking about entering into framework agreements with key contractors. I believe some of the other developers have as well. Can you talk about maybe what you've done in that regard in terms of aligning with key relationships, and what that may allow you to get those in terms of visibility and\/or contractual terms?","James F. O'Neil","Look, I'm not going to give any of the specific conversation with customers, Dan, but we've got to be competitive on our pricing. It's just that the bidding process has changed. These capital programs are becoming so large that it takes a higher degree of coordination and effort and planning. And so just the whole environment has changed from preparing to capitalize or to execute on these types of projects, and it leads to more negotiations or more discussions with our customers. And it's a different environment because of the scope of -- the size of projects and the amount of activity that's coming out from our customers. Those 2 things drive that change in communications, from going from a straight bidding process to a higher level of degree of discussion with our potential customer.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Makes sense. And then real quickly on the fiber business, it looks like -- it's a little hard to tell over the last couple of years, but it doesn't look like the dark fiber business was growing as material as maybe you had hoped. When you look at your decision to maybe shift into more lit fiber, was there also a consideration, as you mentioned, given the consolidation of competitors and this is a bit of an evolution for you, are you guys the right guys to be growing that business in this fashion? Or was there also consideration that maybe divesting the business might also be an alternative, given the high-value placed on these types of assets?","Derrick A. Jensen","Dan, it's Derrick. Actually, I mean, we continue to deal with this as far as the segment reporting that the reality is that the fiber business itself is growing and in fact has double-digit growth. And as we're going into the future, the high-end of our range can still -- considers double-digit growth opportunity in the fiber business. What's misleading is that you have the telecom component of our historical business that is still within there, and so as an example, our decline from last year is all associated with the change in telecom revenues and is offset by the growth that's actually there on the fiber side of the business. So we see -- the high-single digit and double-digit growth opportunities continuing for that group, but it will probably hedge a little bit here in '14 and '15 just because of the fact that we're shifting from the dark fiber to lit fiber model. They've historically performed quite well, historically been able to achieve the double-digit growth. We have no issues with beating our continued ability to achieve those type of growth on that side of the business.","James F. O'Neil","And I do want to add that we're just -- we did provide an aspect of dim and lit services to the K-12 school districts which was our founding -- our first vertical that we entered into. So all we're doing is expanding that to other verticals, and that requires a degree of investment in people and equipment to do that. So it's nothing -- it's not new to us. It's not foreign to us. It's just an expansion of that service capability into broader areas of that business for us.","Operator","The last question comes from Cory Mitchell from D.A. Davidson.","Cory Mitchell - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","My question revolves around Canada and Electric Power. I was just curious to hear how the competition today has evolved over the last year, and if the acquisitions in January were at all in response to that.","James F. O'Neil","Repeat the question, Cory. I didn't catch what the question was.","Cory Mitchell - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I was just curious on how competition has evolved in Canada regarding Electric Power. And then also, if the 4 acquisitions in January were at all in response to that.","James F. O'Neil","No. I mean, we -- I mean, obviously, when we make an acquisition, it's to add to our capabilities to provide solutions to our customers. Did we do it as a defensive move? No. We did it because it -- we're advancing solutions for customers. But we see the same competitors in Canada as we do in the U.S. Every one of our public-traded competitors are trying to move into Canada, so the competitive landscape is no different in Canada.","Cory Mitchell - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then also, Derrick, you talked a little bit about Oil and Gas Infrastructure, saying 9% operating margin. Is it unreasonable to think that as capacity starts to tighten in '15, '16, that you're going to reach 11%, 12%?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, I mean, we continue to look at that segment as having a 9% to 12% margin profile and\/or capability. So yes, I think that -- we would say it's preliminary to say that now, but we think the dynamics exists for us to be able to bring this segment into the 9% to 12% range.","Operator","I will now turn the call back to Mr. O'Neil for closing comments.","James F. O'Neil","We'd like to thank all of you for participating in our fourth quarter and full year 2013 conference call.

Jim?","James F. O'Neil","Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with an operational overview before turning the call over to James Haddox, Quanta's CFO, to provide a detailed review of our first quarter financial results. Following James' comments, we will welcome your questions. ","Our first quarter results reflect continued solid execution by our operations and robust demand for our services. Our revenues in the first quarter grew 68% compared to the first quarter of 2011, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.22 represents a $63.3 million net income improvement over the same quarter last year. Both our 12 month and total backlog increased at the end of the first quarter compared to the end of the same quarter in 2011. 12-month backlog increased about 37% and total backlog increased almost 12% compared to the backlog at the end of the first quarter of 2011. ","Our first quarter results were driven by strong performance in our Electric Power segment, due to the number of electric transmission projects in construction and our ability to safely execute on these projects. Of note, our employed count at the end of this year's first quarter was about 19,000, up 35% compared to the first quarter of last year, and up 7% sequentially since the end of the fourth quarter of 2011. ","Turning to our Electric Power segment, revenues increased approximately 65% in this year's first quarter compared to the same period last year. 12-month backlog at the end of the first quarter for the Electric Power segment increased 45%, and total backlog for this segment increased 14% compared to the end of the 2011 first quarter. We are in the construction phase on 12 large electric transmission projects, and most are progressing as expected without significant delays. We continue to see significant opportunity for large electric transmission awards in 2012 and 2013, as utilities move forward with these projects to improve grid reliability and transport power from renewable sources to load centers. We believe we are still in the early stages of a multiyear transmission build-out in the United States and Canada, and expect our Electric Power segment backlog to remain strong throughout 2012 and beyond. We are currently in various stages of discussions on approximately $1 billion of large electric transmission projects that we expect will be awarded this year. ","As I mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call, we expect the timing of large transmission awards to be lumpy going forward. Therefore, we recommend that investors focus on new award activity over the long term rather than on a quarterly basis. ","In addition to the large electric transmission project opportunities, the smaller transmission market remains active, and tight industry capacity has firmed up pricing for these smaller projects. We have also seen distribution spending increased thus far in 2012 when compared to 2011, but are cautious about our expectation for the remainder of the year given that the politics of an election year could impact utility spending patterns. ","We believe attractive opportunities for solar EPC projects could move forward in 2012 and 2013. During the first quarter, we were selected by GCL Solar Energy to provide comprehensive EPC services on 2 photovoltaic facilities totaling 70 megawatts. These projects are located near the city of Alpaugh in Tulare County, California. The projects are scheduled for completion by year end. And once completed, the combined facilities will be one of the largest photovoltaic tracking facilities in the world. ","We're also working on the 20-megawatt Atwell Island solar facility in Tulare County, California for Solar Project Solutions, a joint venture between Samsung Green Repower and Enco Utility Services. Both of the GCL and Atwell projects are in the early stages of construction and will move into more active state of construction in the second quarter of this year. We are seeing additional utility scale solar opportunities that could be awarded this year. Like large electric transmission projects, we expect the timing of solar EPC project awards to be uneven due to the regulatory environment, availability of project financing and other factors. ","Natural Gas and Pipeline revenues increased about 103% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter last year. At the end of the first quarter of 2012, 12-month backlog and total backlog for our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment increased approximately -- about 29% and 12%, respectively, compared to the end of the first quarter of 2011. Demand for gathering system pipeline infrastructure within the shales is strong, and we remain encouraged by the opportunities we continue to see for our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment. ","Since our last earnings conference call, on February 22, Quanta has been awarded approximately $170 million of pipeline projects, for a total of approximately $370 million of pipeline project awards since the first of the year. The projects awarded thus far in 2012 consist of gathering system and pipeline construction projects that call for Quanta to construct new pipeline facilities and replace existing pipelines to facilitate the transportation of natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil to markets and processing facilities. These projects are for customers such as Anadarko Petroleum, Cayman Energy, EPE Energy , Enbridge Pipeline and Nicor Gas. ","Of our current 12-month backlog for pipeline projects, the majority is for pipeline gathering system infrastructure with the remainder for long-haul pipeline projects. It is worth noting that we have had no -- we had no pipeline gathering projects in hand or in backlog at this time last year. We are also encouraged by the level of long-haul pipeline opportunities on the horizon. In addition to the Keystone XL project, there are several large pipeline projects yet to be awarded that are targeted for construction later this year, in 2013 and in 2014, that will require a significant amount of pipeline construction industry capacity. Based on these long-haul pipeline opportunities, coupled with our expectations of a strong pipeline gathering system market in those years, we anticipate industry capacity could meaningfully tighten going forward. ","As a result of the strategic initiatives we have executed on over the past year and the positive demand side outlook for our pipeline construction services for the next several years, we believe our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment is better positioned today for profitable growth than it was at this time last year. Although we have incurred an operating loss in the first quarter for this segment, we do expect this segment to be profitable for the full year of 2012. ","Our Telecommunications segment continues to experience momentum. Revenues increased approximately 33% in this year's first quarter compared to the same period last year, and we expect to improve financial performance for this segment in 2012 versus 2011. Compared to the end of last year's first quarter, 12 month and total backlog for this segment increased almost 13% and about 2%, respectively. The increase in revenues, margins and backlog for this segment versus the first quarter of last year was driven by increases in the engineering and startup of broadband stimulus projects, fiber-to-the-cell site projects and wireless-related work. We anticipate that this segment's revenues will grow at double-digit rates with attractive margins throughout the year. ","In our Fiber Optic Licensing segment, revenues in the quarter increased approximately 3% compared to the first quarter of last year. 12 month and total backlog increased about 10% and nearly 4%, respectively, at the end of this year's first quarter as compared to the end of the first quarter of 2011. We experienced a pickup in sales activity last year and during the K-12's school district selling season earlier this year. We believe this activity will result in an increased revenue growth in the latter part of this year and into 2013. We continue to balance the build-out of our newer markets to increase network penetration, while investing in our more mature markets that generate higher margins and returns in the near term. This balanced approach has enabled us to enhance our networks to grow returns and revenues, while also maintaining relatively consistent and high margins. ","As a result of our strong first quarter results, the expectation of continued strength in our Electric Power segment, the improved opportunities and better visibility for our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment and our continued expectation for growth in our Telecom segment, we are increasing our 2012 full year outlook. We are increasing our revenue estimate by $400 million to $500 million and our diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share estimates each by $0.10. James will provide additional detail about our outlook in his comments. ","Though we are excited about our opportunities for 2012, our outlook continues to take in account a challenging operating environment due to economic uncertainty, and in particular, a tough regulatory environment in a presidential election year. These factors are outside of our control, and they have impacted the timing of project awards and project starts in the past. ","In summary, total company backlog remains strong. Our Electric Power segment continues to perform well, and we see significant transmission opportunities for the next several years. We also believe our better positioning and indications of an improved operating environment for our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment should produce better results for this segment in 2012 versus 2011, with momentum building in 2013 and 2014. As a result, we believe all of our operating segments will experience an increase in revenues and margins in 2012. ","As a final note, in early April, we announced that James Haddox will assume the role of Executive Vice President of Quanta on May 17 of this year and that Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration and Chief Accounting Officer will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer on the same date. James will remain actively involved with Quanta in his role as Executive Vice President. Derrick has been with Quanta since its inception. I have worked with Derrick for nearly 14 years, and I'd like to thank James and congratulate Derrick, and I look forward to continuing to work with them both. ","With that, I would like to turn the call over to James.","James H. Haddox","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.43 billion for the first quarter of 2011 compared to $849 million in the prior year's first quarter, reflecting growth of about 68% quarter-over-quarter. Net income attributable to common stock for the quarter was $45.7 million or $0.22 per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $17.6 million or a loss of $0.08 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year. The growth in consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2012 was driven by growth across all of Quanta's segments. Also contributing to our increased revenues in the first quarter of 2012 was the incremental contribution of approximately $50 million in revenues during the quarter from companies acquired since the first quarter of 2011. ","Our consolidated gross margin increased from 8.4% in 1Q '11 to 13.7% in 1Q '12. This increase was due to higher profit margins earned across all of our segments, with the majority of the increase being driven by improved performance on electric power transmission projects and reduced losses in the Natural Gas segment. ","Selling, general and administrative expenses of $107 million increased $15 million as compared to last year's first quarter. This increase is primarily attributable to $4.1 million in higher salary and benefit costs associated with increased levels of activity; approximately $3.7 million in additional administrative expenses associated with companies acquired since the first quarter of 2011; and $3.1 million in increased professional fees and technology development costs relating to starting activities that no longer qualify for capitalization. ","As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased from 10.8% in the first quarter of 2011 to 7.5% in the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to the higher overall revenues as previously discussed. ","Our consolidated operating margin before amortization expense increased from a loss of 2.4% in 1Q '11 to a positive 6.2% in 1Q '12. ","To further discuss our segment results, the Electric Power segment's revenues were up about $367 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 65%. Revenues were positively impacted by higher revenues from electric power transmission services resulting from an increase in the number and size of projects that are ongoing in 1Q '12 compared to 1Q '11. Also contributing to this increase was the incremental contribution of $40 million in revenue from acquired companies and $16 million in higher emergency restoration services, resulting primarily from winter storm work in the Northwest region of the United States. Additionally, as compared to last year's first quarter, when we had construction start delays on 3 major power transmission projects, this year's first quarter had no such delay. ","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment increased to 11.7% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 5.2% in last year's first quarter, primarily due to higher overall revenues from services on higher-margin transmission projects, as well as increased higher-margin emergency restoration services. Additionally, these increased revenues contributed to this segment's improved ability to cover fixed and overhead costs. ","Natural Gas and Pipeline revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by 103% to $358.9 million in 1Q '12, primarily due to an increase in number and size of transmission pipeline projects. Additionally, we saw increases in revenues from natural gas distribution services due to an outsourced services agreement for gas distribution work, which we started in the second quarter of 2011, as well as increased spending by certain of our customers. ","Operating loss for the Natural Gas and Pipeline segment as a percentage of revenues decreased to negative 3.1% for 1Q '12 from a negative 20.9% for 1Q '11. This improvement was primarily due to the prior year being significantly impacted by productivity issues on certain gas transmission pipeline projects, which were hampered by unusual winter weather and complicated by restrictive governmental regulations. Significant rainfall adversely impacted the profitability of certain projects in the first quarter of 2012, although, to a lesser extent than we experienced in 1Q of '11. ","Revenues from our Telecommunications segment increased $26.6 million or 33% from $106 million in 1Q '12, primarily due to an increase in the volume of work associated with stimulus-funded fiber optic construction projects and higher revenues from fiber-to-the-cell site initiatives, resulting from higher capital spending by our customers. Operating margin in the Telecommunications segment was 7.9% in 1Q '12 compared to a negative 4.6% in 1Q '11. This increase in margin is primarily due to the increased demand for our services, allowing for margin expansion, as well as the impact of revenue increases on this segment's ability to cover fixed costs. ","Fiber Optic Licensing segment revenues were $27.0 million for the first quarter of 2012, reflecting an increase of 3% over 1Q '11. Operating margin was 50% in 1Q '12 compared to operating margin of 45.8% in 1Q '11. ","When calculating margins by segment, we do not allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization expense to our segments. Therefore, the previous discussion about operating margins by segment excludes the effect of such expenses. Corporate and unallocated costs increased $13.3 million in the first quarter of '12 as compared to 1Q of 2011, primarily due to $5.3 million in higher salary and incentive compensation costs associated with current levels of operating activity, and $3.1 million in higher amortization expense, as well as increased professional fees and technology development costs relating to certain activities that no longer qualify for capitalization. ","Adjusted diluted earnings per share, as calculated in today's press release, was $0.27 for the first quarter of 2012 compared to an adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.05 in 1Q '11. Cash flow used in operations was approximately $60 million. Capital expenditures were about $34 million, resulting in approximately $94 million in negative free cash flow for the quarter. The negative free cash flow during the first quarter of 2012 was primarily due to higher costs in excess of billing balances and certain ongoing electric and gas transmission projects at first quarter production that had now reached milestone billing points, as well as increased retainage balances associated with these ongoing projects. The higher production on certain transmission projects due to favorable weather resulted in increased revenue. However, some of the billing units associated with these projects are large, and the milestones for submission of these billings had not occurred as of the quarter end. Despite these increases, our days sales outstanding or DSOs were 79 days at March 31, 2012, versus 84 days at March 31, 2011, and 68 days at December 31, 2011. ","EBITA for the first quarter of 2012 was $84.7 million or 5.9% of revenues, compared to a negative $22 million or negative 2.6% of revenues for the first quarter of 2011. ","Adjusted EBITDA was $122.4 million or 8.6% of revenues for the first quarter of 2012, compared to $12 million or 1.4% of revenues for the first quarter of 2011. ","The calculation of EBITA and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, all non-GAAP measures, and the definitions of these and DSOs can be found in the Investors & Media section of our website at quantaservices.com. ","At March 31, 2012, we had about $182 million in letters of credit outstanding, primarily to secure our insurance program, and had no other borrowing. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $177 million in cash. Considering our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we have nearly $695 million in total liquidity as of March 31. ","We closed 3 acquisitions during the first quarter for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $67 million, comprised of about $25 million in stock and $42 million in cash. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we closed an additional acquisition of a full-service electrical construction company in the Southeast U.S. for $38 million and finalized an additional $52 million equity investment in Howard Midstream Energy Partners. Howard Energy used the proceeds of our investment, together with capital contributed by other investors, to acquire additional pipeline assets in South Texas. Our equity investment in Howard is approximately $87 million after this transaction, representing about a 31% interest. ","Concerning our outlook for 2012, we expect revenues for the second quarter of 2012 to range between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share to be $0.28 to $0.30 on a GAAP basis. This estimate compares to revenues of $1.01 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.15 in GAAP EPS in 2Q '11. Our GAAP EPS forecast for 2Q '12 includes an estimate of $7 million for noncash compensation expenses and $10 million for amortization expenses. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter are expected to be $0.33 to $0.35, and compared to non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.19 in 2Q '11. This non-GAAP measure is calculated on the same basis as the historical calculations of adjusted diluted earnings per share presented in the release. ","As a result of our strong financial performance in the first quarter of 2012, our increased backlog and our higher level of confidence in the expected results for our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment, we have increased our 2012 guidance. We currently expect revenues for the full year 2012 to range between $5.4 billion and $5.7 billion, and diluted earnings per share to be between $1 to $1.20 on a GAAP basis. This estimate compares to revenues of $4.6 billion and $0.62 in GAAP EPS in 2011. Our GAAP EPS forecast for 2012 includes an estimate of $26 million for noncash compensation expenses and $39 million of amortization expense. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from 2012 -- for 2012 are expected to be $1.19 to $1.39. We are currently forecasting net income attributable to noncontrolling interest to be approximately $4 million in the second quarter of 2012 and $16.3 million for the year. ","For additional guidance, we're currently projecting our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 37% for 2012, and we expect our diluted share count to be about 212 million shares for 2012. We expect CapEx for all of 2012 to be approximately $190 million to $225 million, which includes CapEx for our Fiber Licensing segment of about $40 million to $50 million. This compares to CapEx of all of 2011 of $172 million. ","As Jim commented, we have entered 2012 with quite a bit of momentum in our business. We believe that we're operationally and financially well-positioned for solid growth in 2012 and beyond. As you know, this will be my last quarterly conference call as the CFO of Quanta. Effective at our annual meeting on May 17, Derrick Jensen will become CFO of Quanta. Derrick and I have worked closely together since the inception of Quanta, and I'm confident that Derrick will do an excellent job as Quanta's CFO. As for me, I'm looking forward to serving as Quanta's EVP and assisting Quanta as needed through this transition.","This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question does come from the line of Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","James, we're going to miss you. So I look forward to hopefully seeing you at Quanta headquarters. My first question is really, obviously, if you look at the strong performance in the second quarter and how it's shaping up, a lot of your guidance being taken up seems to reflect that. As you look at the second half of this year, could you talk a bit about the drivers that are on the positive, and really a little more color on the risk you're assuming there?","James F. O'Neil","Tahira, we probably, for the first time, we've taken a lot of uncommitted out of our forecast because we are in an election year. And so much of our backlog is large project work that's subject to starts and stops because of the owners' regulatory environment. And so we've taken a conservative approach, and we've got very high -- I think our pipeline business is pretty much what we forecasted is what we have in backlog for the year. Not much uncommitted if any at all. And on the electric side, we're really not taking into account any future awards to any greater extent. So we are being conservative because we have been through this before. In prior -- in the last year, we've had some stops in projects which we got on the wrong side of guidance. So we're just trying to be conservative, and we'll take it a quarter at a time.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That seems to make sense. And I guess my second question is, your commentary on the long-haul pipeline side, very encouraging and really the first blush, really, outside of Keystone that seems positive. Could you talk a bit about what you think is driving this, and what we should be looking out for to see these projects really move ahead?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean, I can talk in general. Again, it's difficult because of the customer environment and the pipeline segment for us to disclose too much information specifically about customers. But it's what we've been saying all along, it's the Canadian oil sands, pipeline infrastructure, bringing that product to refineries either into the U.S. or to shipping ports in Canada. And also, just the gathering system in long-haul pipeline infrastructure to bring shale products to refineries and to markets throughout the U.S. And that's been the consistent theme, and we're starting to see some traction in the industry. And I think that it's getting ready to break out, the industry in general. And we're going to have some very robust years ahead, and we'll benefit from that.","Operator","And our next question does come from the line of Will Gabrielski with Lazard Capital Markets.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about beyond the reliability and congestion of renewables-driven transmission work? I've just been seeing a lot more talk about rebuilding of lines and enforcement of NERC regulations. How much is that impacting your business? And what does that look like going forward?","James F. O'Neil","That's a very good question, Will. The small transmission market is really accelerating and that is being driven by NERC compliance. And I would say that we're probably seeing just as large of an increase in the smaller transmission market, which probably makes up for almost half of our overall transmission market, just giving you a general estimate. I see that part of the transmission business accelerating even more than my large transmission market, and it's being driven by the NERC compliance standards.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Is there any way -- or have you seen any numbers that can quantify maybe the number of miles that are out there that could possibly fall under some sort of NERC-driven rebuild cycle?","James F. O'Neil","We're hearing around 10,000 miles right now. It's probably going to increase over time.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then one last question, if you'll allow me. Can you just run through -- you said you have 12 big projects in construction now. As you look through the year, what the schedule looks like in terms of big jobs winding down and then maybe some jobs that you recently booked moving into construction?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean, I think in general, the way to look at it is you got Sunrise and Hydro One that are winding down here in the second quarter. And you got most of the CREZ that's winding up in the second quarter. That's the big, I guess, movement. The other projects are moving along in construction, and they have completion schedules anywhere from mid-2013 all the way out through 2016.","Operator","And our next question does come from the line of Scott Levine with JPMorgan.","Rodney C. Clayton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Rodney Clayton here for Scott. And congrats, again, to Derrick and James on your responsibilities there. So first, I just want to focus a bit on the regulatory environment. It sounds like you didn't have many delays in Q1 and it feels like maybe your visibility into the timing on some of the transmission projects is improving. Should we interpret that to mean that the permitting environment is getting any less onerous or is it just that some of your newer projects have had the time to push through the regulatory bottleneck?","James F. O'Neil","I think it's the latter. I think that the regulatory environment has been onerous for our customers, and that we've just had projects move through that bottleneck into construction. But we are -- we do still have some projects that are working in Forest Service lands and we're just being very conservative on forecasting those projects through the rest of the year.","Rodney C. Clayton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I appreciate your commentary around election year politics. I certainly understand that. Are you seeing any impact at this time from the election calendar? Or is it just -- or that's just something that you're cognizant of that, that could occur later on?","James F. O'Neil","We're cognizant of it, that it could occur later on. We haven't seen anything to date, but we expect the unexpected today versus the -- in the past.","Rodney C. Clayton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then finally, looking at your pipeline business, obviously, revenue very strong in the quarter. And I understand that it's going to be profitable on a full year basis. Can you just remind us, what kind of turns that -- pushes that in the profitability? Is it just the higher activity levels that you're expecting later on in the year, absorbing your fixed costs? Or is there -- or is there some of the catalysts there?","James F. O'Neil","No, I think it's just moving out of the first quarter that had some bad weather -- or challenging weather. It's just better weather. And second and third quarter is when you really move into full execution and get your better weather, to will drive a profitable business, which in turn will give us, we think, a marginally profitable business for the full year of '12. So we're looking forward to the second quarter and beyond in that segment.","Operator","And our next question does come from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Andrew Buscaglia","This is Andrew Buscaglia on behalf of Jamie Cook. So I got a quick question on -- just looking at, sort of looking at your strength in Q1, which is usually a seasonally weaker quarter. I know you mentioned that you had some revenues from acquisitions and some better weather. Was there anything else there that surprised you that -- I mean, I think you surprised us here a little bit, with such a strong top line and the margins were pretty good. So is there anything else that you're seeing in what is usually sort of a seasonally weaker time frame?","James F. O'Neil","No, Andrew, I think it was really -- we just had so much transmission work going on. And the winter weather was very mild throughout the country, and we got better production and that translated into better margins. I think if there was anything added to that, is we were doing more work in the small transmission market than we expected because of NERC compliance.","Andrew Buscaglia","Okay, yes. So, yes, it looks like some of the weather helped. Do you think that might have pulled anything? I know looking at your guidance, it looks like the back half implies sort of like a $0.60 between Q3 and Q4. Is that just you being conservative or is there just -- is there -- is some of that demand -- or some of that -- from the strength in Q1, just kind of pulled ahead from the remaining 3 quarters?","James F. O'Neil","Again, I think -- well, we're being conservative in the second half of the year because it is an election year. So if you model the second half of the year, the fourth quarter's probably going to be light because we don't have a lot of uncommitted in there. So that's -- it is a conservative second half of the year, and we'll take it a quarter at a time.","Operator","And our next question does come from the line of Alex Rygiel with FBR.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","But a couple of quick questions. First on the pipeline business. What's your geographic mix these days, given that it's changed a little bit over the last 12 months?","James F. O'Neil","We've primarily been in the Marcellus and we had a transmission job in the -- a long-haul pipeline job in Texas in the first quarter. That's completed. But we're primarily in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford and Bakken. That's where we're positioned to take advantage of these liquid-rich plays. Of course, our long-haul pipeline, we work throughout the country, wherever there's an opportunity.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And could you run through your view on pricing by end market?","James F. O'Neil","By end market, you mean by segment or just in the pipeline business?","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","You can go by segment in all your businesses.","James F. O'Neil","I mean, pricing across the board is, I guess I can just say in general, is strengthening because the capacity in all of our segments is tightening up. You can look at any of the businesses, whether it's electric distribution, the small transmission market, the large electric transmission market, even the pipeline business is beginning to firm up. Telecom has been very active. That market's firmed up. So that should all translate into better margins this year compared to last on a consolidated basis.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And one last question. Given sort of some of the transition in transmission projects in 2Q, should we expect margins in Electric Power to be a little bit better or a little bit softer than 1Q?","James F. O'Neil","I think, margins should continue to be strong. It's going to be driven by Electric Power segment, which should perform on the upper end of the 9% to 12% operating income. We can't really take any one quarter. The second quarter -- the first quarter, obviously, was strong because we had good weather. It almost felt like a second or third quarter because of the mild weather. So I think I'd just rather leave it at that. You can't really show any patterns, margins should -- throughout the year, margins just should be strong. They should be in the upward, in the 9% to 12%, maybe even better than that for the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Beach with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jeffrey L. Beach - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You had quantified the bidding opportunities in your Electric Power division, can you quantify opportunities, talk about how active the bidding or discussions are in the other 2 major divisions, gas and gas pipeline -- or Gas and Pipeline and Telecom?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, on the pipeline side, Jeff, it's very active. It's a little bit different dynamic because last year, we were looking at $1.8 billion worth of activity that was going to be awarded and constructed during that calendar year. Obviously, that didn't play out. Now we're looking at probably a much higher number than that, but over 2- to 3-year construction period. So I think, a lot of that will firm up between now and the end of the year. So it's a very robust environment on the pipeline side. I would say it's definitely more robust than it was last year at this time. Telecom, obviously, we're in the height of the construction cycle for stimulus. We're still getting awards. We're seeing some MSA agreements come into play on the Telecom side as well. I think we had much as $30 million of MSA awards on the Telecom side in the first quarter. And we think that trend will continue. So it's still a very strong environment. Distribution, again, that market's growing. It's just all around, all of our segments have momentum. And price is tightening up, and the environment looks good in 2012 and into '13 and '14.","Jeffrey L. Beach - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And specifically with Telecom, you've got a nice backlog. Is there enough opportunity to maintain or possibly even grow that backlog through the year?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean, one thing, that's the wild card -- and we don\u2019t think it's going to be a big issue because stimulus construction should wind down in the middle of '13. But many of the customers that benefited from stimulus will continue with their capital programs to expand the networks and then the wireless business should continue to accelerate, specifically, back-haul fiber construction. So we think that we may not have as strong a growth in Telecom in '14 over '13, as we do in our other segments, but it should still be a very strong environment.","Operator","And our next question does come from the line of Zach Larkin with Stephens Inc.","Zach Larkin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","First question I had, Jim, I wanted to go back to your comments on the winding down of the Sunrise and Hydro One and then the increase on CREZ. As you're looking at those, knowing that both Sunrise and Hydro were done on a more compressed time schedule, do you think that the increase on the CREZ projects is going to be enough to offset them as we move kind of 2Q into 3Q? Or should we expect maybe a little bit of softening just on the overall level given those dynamics?","James F. O'Neil","Now remember, CREZ is compressed, too. I mean that schedule -- many of those customers compress their schedules from 12 to 18 months. Less time to build those lines. The completion dates still must be by the middle of '13. So you're not going to see any softening in transmission in the second quarter.","Zach Larkin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in second to third, same, same kind of dynamic there?","James F. O'Neil","Yes.","Zach Larkin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as you're looking at the renewables opportunities, are you seeing any differences or changes in the tides and\/or scope of EPC projects that you're doing in that space?","James F. O'Neil","No, it's pretty consistent with what we've done on the prior years. I will add that these opportunities that we're capitalizing on do take advantage of the 1603 tax grants. So beyond '13 and '14 -- or excuse me, beyond '12 and '13, we'll just have to see whether renewable market goes. But it looks like a very robust market for the next 1.5 years for us.","Operator","And our next question does come from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Jeff kind of just asked my question, but maybe I'll ask it again and you can expand it -- expand on it. But the Telecom backlog, total backlog up only 2% year-over-year. I just want to make sure that they didn't really portend any real weakening there, maybe it's just a lumpy issue.","James F. O'Neil","Yes, you've got to remember that a lot of this stimulus work was awarded to us, and there were delays in the construction due to the permitting -- environmental permitting that was necessary. So we're burning off a lot of that construction -- that backlog in an accelerated manner because that was a bottleneck as well. So I think any backlog increase in that segment, with the amount of construction activity going on, is a positive.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then I did want to ask about, you made a comment about your electric utility customers, there -- are they feeling a little bit pressure? Maybe they cut back on distribution spending a little bit here as we move through 2012. What -- is that an issue of, with natural gas prices being down, is that squeezing their profitability a little bit? Why the weakness there from electric utility customers?","James F. O'Neil","No, I mean, distribution was up in '11 over '10, and we've seen it up so far in the first quarter. And we still see momentum in distribution spending. We're just being cautious about being in an election year because when we had the midterm elections is when we saw distribution cuts the last time, politics played a role in the, I guess, in capital programs being cut back on distribution. So we're just anticipating that, that type of phenomenon could happen again. We haven't seen anything that indicates that. But our forecast is leaning towards being conservative in case that does come into play.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And when you talk to those electric utility customers, they're not telling you they're concerned, you're just being cautious just based on your experience.","James F. O'Neil","Being cautious, I mean, right now, the distribution -- the customer budgets are being released in the first quarter for distribution spending. So it's more an unknown right now to us. But we don't expect distribution. We haven't heard anything from our customers that they're cutting back. It's just a cautious approach.","Operator","And our next question does come from the line of Ahmar Zaman with Piper Jaffray.","Ahmar M. Zaman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","A couple of questions. First one, so in your electric and pipeline business, a strong quarter. How should we think about the linearity in this business through the year, as we go through the year here? And what are some of the drivers of that linearity?","James F. O'Neil","When you talk about linearity, are you talking about the seasonality of the business or our growth year-over-year?","Ahmar M. Zaman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just the year -- as we go -- as we look at the full year, with a very strong quarter in the first quarter, as we go through Q2, Q3 and the second half of the year, do you expect any slowdown or continuous sequential growth? How should we think about that?","James F. O'Neil","No, you should see a double-digit revenue growth in each of our segments and improving margins for the year, year-over-year. And a lot of that is being driven by increased activity in the U.S. and Canada. And Canada is going to be a very active market this year.","Ahmar M. Zaman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, great. And so we should just assume that growth -- that strong double-digit growth year-over-year just linearly throughout the year?","James F. O'Neil","That's correct.","Ahmar M. Zaman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Second question's on smart grid. We've heard there's some slowdown on the smart grid sector especially around AMI. What are you seeing in some of your engagements in the smart grid side?","James F. O'Neil","We've got smart grid insulation contracts throughout the country and related smart grid apparatus like a wireless infrastructure and switchgear installations, and we haven't seen any slowdown in our smart grid business. Of course, incrementally, that's a very small part of our overall revenues. That's probably less than $100 million of what we do today. But we haven't seen any slowdown in that business.","Ahmar M. Zaman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Great. And then just -- I think, somebody already asked this question on your renewables side. Specifically on solar, you mentioned the 2 projects you won with GCL. What are you seeing in terms of overall solar growth in the U.S. year-over-year? Do you have any projections for the amount of megawatts this year that you're expecting for the U.S. market?","James F. O'Neil","I think it was a 2-gig market last year. I think that number should be fairly consistent this year. But you got to be careful because a lot of that is distributive solar, and utility scale solar is kind of mixed in. But I think the utility scale programs that we're seeing is a very robust environment at least for the next 2 years, compared to what we've seen over the last 2 or 3 years.","Operator","And our next question does come from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess my first question is really on your gas margins. Jim, if I heard you correctly, it's seems like you will get the profitability this year. Perhaps you can tell us a little bit about the timing. Do you expect the timing to be in 2Q? And then more specifically, as we kind of move out into 2013, do you think we can get back to a normalized margin range there for that business, just based on the visibility that you have today?","James F. O'Neil","Yes. We expect to be profitable in 2Q. We have forecasted this to be marginally profitable for the year. I think that's being conservative, because we've only forecasted the backlog we have in hand. But certainly we expect execution and hopefully more awards. And we should be better than hopefully marginally breakeven or marginally profitable. We certainly think that in '13 and '14, we should return to normal margin patterns that we have seen in years prior to 2011.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And maybe a follow-on to that is, at your Investor Day, you guys listed a few sample pipeline projects that you expected to start construction in 2012, 2013. Perhaps maybe you can provide an update on whether any of those projects have been awarded yet or whether you're still expecting those projects to move forward as planned?","James F. O'Neil","None of those have been awarded to -- I know there's been some Texas projects awarded. But for the most part, that list, most of those haven't been awarded. They're all still in play. And they should move into construction in '12 -- excuse me, '13 and '14. Most of those projects will move into construction in '13 and '14.","Operator","And our next question does come from the line of William Bremer with Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","James, wish you well. Derrick, congratulations. Many of my questions have been answered. I want to go into pipeline in terms of integrity and inspection. Can you give us an idea of how that has been progressing throughout this first quarter?","James F. O'Neil","It's been progressing very well. It's a very small percentage of our overall pipeline segment, revenues today. But it probably has the opportunity to grow faster than any other part of our business. And we actually bought a pigging company in the first quarter to help -- allow us to provide full service -- integrity services to our customers. And we're excited about that business. And we think that over the next several years, for years to come, that business should grow significantly.","Operator","And our next question does come from the line of Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I hate to pick on the pipeline business, still. But I do have a couple of questions. I guess it's just confusing to me because the revenue was so strong, I mean, it doubled last year. And when I looked at what the margins were in that business in 2010, when your revenue was about half of what you did this quarter, you weren't posting losses. So I guess maybe the way to ask it is, the shale work that you're doing versus the long-haul work, can you break out kind of what the profitability was in your shale work specifically?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean it's pretty consistent, Justin, with the shale and the pipeline work. I mean, we -- a couple of data points for you. I mean, we did have a very good revenue quarter. And we typically see that type of revenue in the second and third quarter, we had it in the first. And we did have the mild weather in the winter due to the fact just because we did have more rain and snow and frozen ground to work in and that the muddy conditions certainly hurt our production. And I hate talking about the weather. All I can tell you is you're going to see improved performance in the second and third quarter and for the full year. And we had a challenge in the first quarter but we -- I think we've talked about being breakeven in the pipeline segment. We did have a slight loss because of some of the weather challenges that we faced, primarily in the Marcellus.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","To be clear then, I guess it's not an asset utilization issue here, where you're not generating enough revenue to cover it. It was more specific to the quarter because of weather-related issues.","James F. O'Neil","That's correct. That's correct. We're fairly -- we're pretty well utilized right now. So we feel pretty good about our position going into the second quarter.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then my second question. A little more high level, but one of the things we're starting to hear more about is FERC pushing back on the allowed ROEs of some of these larger transmission projects. And I guess, just to the extent you can comment on kind of what you're seeing on that front, and if that's having any impact on kind of the decision calculus of the utilities?","James F. O'Neil","We're not really seeing that. But if that was the case, you still have the reliability issues that need to be addressed. And even if they ratchet back the ROEs, it's still going to be the higher -- the best investment for our utility customers. It will still be the highest rate of return for them, would be in transmission. So we're not concerned about that. But we haven't really seen or heard any of our customers talk about reduced ROEs affecting any of the capital programs going forward.","Operator","And our next question does come from the line of Craig Irwin with Wedbush Securities.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked, but I was hoping that you might be able to comment a little bit about the Electric Power segment, and maybe the difference in profitability that you're seeing between your larger projects and some of your smaller projects in the typical O&M type work you do for your customers. And whether or not you expect that, that spread will narrow over the course of the next several quarters.","James F. O'Neil","Well, usually in the past, in the slower, smaller transmission market, we saw probably 400 to 500 basis points gap in margins. But now, I think it's pretty much neutral. You might have a little bit of a gap, but it's nothing very wide. And then I would say that there are almost maybe 100 basis points difference with that on the smaller transmission jobs. I'm not saying there aren't some select jobs that might have 200, 300 basis points difference. But overall, with the small transmission market, pricing has improved significantly because of the tightened capacity in the industry.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. And previously, in your prepared comments, you mentioned $1 billion in large transmission projects that you're actively pursuing, that you think have a good probability of being awarded. Can you clarify if you've already been shortlisted for those projects or those are high probability projects for Quanta to be awarded? Or is this something where we should maybe allocate your more normal sort of win rate on large projects to scope out the potential future awards for Quanta right there?","James F. O'Neil","There's a good portion of those that there's a significant -- a high probability that we'll be awarded. There's similar others that we're in the final running, there's probably just 2 contractors being evaluated.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. I'm sorry, just to clarify, should we look at that year receiving your typical share of the large projects on that $1 billion, or should your share of that $1 billion and potential work be substantially higher than your more recent win rate?","James F. O'Neil","It will be higher than our more recent win rate.","Operator","And our next question does come from the line of Dan Mannes with Avondale.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Congrats to both Derrick and James. I'm going to pile on, on the pipeline segment. You had a couple of questions in this arc, and I guess I want to follow-through on it. When you contrast the bidding environment this year to last year, you noted there's a significantly larger amount. Can you talk about the pace of words, have you seen more coming through than you did last year? Or is it sort of the same scenario where nothing -- very little work is actually being awarded?","James F. O'Neil","We're seeing a lot of gathering system work being awarded and there's significantly more discussions and activity around the long-haul pipeline that will be constructed toward the end of this year and into '13 and '14 than what we've seen in a long time.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up on that, and I think you might have mentioned some of the regions. We've seen a couple of contracts get awarded down in Texas to union contractors like Price Gregory. Is that indicative of maybe a better and maybe less aggressive pricing -- a more attractive pricing environment for contractors? Or are those sort of one-offs that we should not pay attention to?","James F. O'Neil","No, I think it's the former. I think it's the tightening capacity in the industry and pricing is firming up.","James H. Haddox","I thought also. We've had a couple of questions -- this is James. We've had a couple of questions about the seasonality or linearity in our forecast. And I thought I'd clarify that. We -- by our expansion of our services into Canada, although it's somewhat counterintuitive, I think this year, that's going to flatten some of the typical seasonality that you've seen in our business because the weather in Canada was normal this year, so it froze when it was supposed to, unlike last year, and created the ability for us to work in tundra and in environments that you have to work in, in frozen conditions. So we are now working in Canada and seasons -- in the season that's typically a slow season if we're just in the U.S. So I think you're going to see in our forecast, when you guys start to try to do your quarterly models, you're going to see, we have a flattening of the differentials between, say, the first quarter and second quarter and third quarter because of that effect. We did have some weather effect on the pipeline division because of rain on a couple of jobs that we had in the first quarter. So you can see that in the margins. And then, the fourth quarter, when you start to model it out based on our guidance, the fourth quarter is probably going to be somewhat lower than you're accustomed to, related to the other quarters, but that's because of the fact that it's an election year and the weather is unpredictable when you get into the fourth quarter. If it doesn't freeze in Canada when we think it's going to, or if we have adverse weather in the fourth quarter in the U.S. that affects our productivity, the fourth quarter could be lower than you expect it to be. So that's why some of you seem to be or may be having problems with modeling the quarters compared to our typical seasonality. I just thought I would try to clarify that for you guys. Do we have any other caller?","Operator","And we do have one final question, it does come from the line of Will Gabrielski with Lazard Capital Markets.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I'm just wondering if you guys could talk maybe about your balance sheet and then capital allocation from here and any plans to maybe do some more repurchases?","James H. Haddox","At the present time, we don't have any approvals from our board to do any repurchases. Right now, as you can see from our balance sheet, between the end of the year and the end of the first quarter and continuing on into the second quarter, we're using our capital exactly like we've been saying we would use it, which is to help support working capital requirements of all of the large projects and increases in backlog that we see. So that's coming to fruition as we've been saying for the last couple of years. We're also using it for capital expenditures. We are seeing the normal amount of acquisition activity that we've seen in the past. As we said, we completed one since the end of the second quarter. And then as we get through the year and see how our cash flow looks and the need for capital on all the items I just mentioned, then we'll start looking at other uses of capital, such as share repurchases and down the list, a dividend possibly. But at this point in time, there's no plan for share repurchase or dividend on our agenda.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","All right. You just had a lot of pressure on the board to pay a dividend on your way out, I guess?","James H. Haddox","I didn't think I did. That was a mistake if I did that.","Operator","And at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.","James F. O'Neil","Well, I'd like to thank you all for participating on our first quarter 2012 conference call. We appreciate your questions and your ongoing interest in Quanta Services. Thank you.

Duke?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. On the call, I will provide operational and strategic commentary before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our second quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","We posted a solid second quarter and are pleased with our results for the first half of this year. Second quarter revenues were a record $2.66 billion and GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.48 and $0.59 respectively. The second half of this year is strengthening as our base business activity seasonally increases and our larger pipeline projects ramp into construction, which should result in top line growth and margin expansion. We ended the quarter with record 12-month backlog of $7.4 billion with each segment at record 12-month backlog levels as well.","Due to our first half results and strengthening levels of activity for the second half of the year, we are maintaining our full year earnings per share guidance. Our larger pipeline project activity is increasing considerably, but we are still in the early stages of execution. Thus, we continue to take a prudent approach to setting our guidance, but believe there is opportunity to outperform if we execute well through project risk contingencies.","The larger pipeline projects are expected to account for approximately 10% to 15% of consolidated revenues this year. This type of work is the most difficult to forecast. At the end of the second quarter, Quanta had more than 37,000 employees who worked nearly 40 million man hours during the first six months of the year, and we are well on pace to finish the year with record man hours. These data points are indicative of record levels of activity in our end markets and the strong demand for Quanta's capital program solutions, which provide cost and quality certainty to our customers.","As we have discussed previously, there is a shortage of craft skilled labor in our North American markets at a time when our customers are expanding their capital and operating budgets to record levels. Quanta has incrementally invested more than $100 million in various initiatives over the past five years to attract and retain what we believe is the best workforce in our industry.","We are focused on safety and training and have executed on industry-leading strategic initiatives such as the development of our world-class training facility in Texas and the recent acquisition of Northwest (sic) Lineman College. Our dedication to our employees has made us the preferred employer in the industries we serve and our ability to enhance our customers' profitability by efficiently deploying skilled resources to the field is a differentiator that provides us with the opportunity to increase market share.","Our Electric Power operations continued to execute well from both a top line and margin perspective. The strong performance in the quarter was driven by solid execution across our operations. And our execution on the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project, the largest project in Quanta's history remains excellent.","We continue to have a positive near and long-term outlook for our Electric Power segment as our customers continue with their grid modernization programs to accommodate a changing fuel generation mix towards natural gas and renewables, address aging infrastructure, strengthen systems for resiliency against extreme weather events and support long-term economic growth. For example, the U.S. Energy Information Administration or EIA recently reported that major U.S. utilities have increased investment on the electric distribution system by 54% over the past 20 years from $31 billion to $51 billion annually.","During the same timeframe, investment in transmission infrastructure nearly doubled. We expect these trends to continue for some time as our customers' multi-year transmission and distribution capital budgets continue to increase.","Last week, AEP announced that due to regulatory challenges it was terminating its effort to build Wind Catcher Generation Tie Line for which Quanta had been awarded the EPC contract. While this is disappointing, we remind the investment community that this project was not reflected in our guidance or backlog nor was it a driver shaping our positive multi-year outlook. It would have been a nice project to have, but it was not one that we have to have. It is unfortunate when good projects like Wind Catcher and Northern Pass do not receive the required regulatory clearance to move forward, but it is not a negative for Quanta as it may appear. These projects were for longtime customers with whom we have strong strategic relationships.","So, we expect to continue to have opportunities to partner with them on future projects. We believe our involvement with projects like these strengthens our relationship with our customers and positions Quanta to grow with them. Additionally, we see opportunities for larger transmission projects picking up not slowing down. There are more than $3 billion in aggregate contract value of larger electric transmission projects and various stages of tender in North America that we are pursuing.","Some of these projects could be awarded by the end of this year. We will maintain the bidding discipline and risk profiles necessary to safely execute these projects and provide cost certainty to our customers. We do not expect to win all these projects but we believe we are well positioned on all of them. Our end markets are strengthening and we continue to believe we're in earlier stages of an upward multi-year cycle. In addition to growing opportunities for larger transmission projects, demand for our base business where it continues to grow. Small and Medium transmission and substation projects as well as distribution work remains very active and large multi-year MSA proposal activity is at an all-time high.","Within our Electric Power segment our communications operations performed largely as expected during the second quarter with growth led by our U.S. operations. Importantly, we continued to believe we have the opportunity to exit this year with operating income margins achieving high single digit levels. We continue to make inroads with customers as they deploy capital for fiber-to-the-home and business, long-haul fiber, 4G wireless backhaul and the early stages of 5G.","More of them are turning to Quanta for our turnkey execution capabilities, performance and ability to quickly deploy resources. In many cases, we are viewed as a strong alternative to our competitors. In fact, two cities we were recently awarded for fiber deployments were removed from others by our customers and given to Quanta due to the quality and timeliness of our work and execution for them in other cities. Rather, we're seeing some companies rebidding fiber deployments in certain of the markets, not due to price but to try to gain access to better resources and execution capabilities. We believe this provides opportunity for Quanta going forward.","As 5G wireless networks are deployed, there are significant fiber backhaul requirements. We believe 5G also creates opportunity for our electric distribution operations, since many of the 5G small cells will be deployed on the electric utility poles and other electrical infrastructure. This puts Quanta in a unique position to provide electric and telecom services to the communications industry.","Turning to our Oil & Gas segment; we generated greater than expected revenues during the quarter, primarily driven by base business activity and our industrial services, natural gas distribution and pipeline integrity operations. As mentioned at an investor conference in June, we experienced minor delays on a certain larger pipeline projects that shifted work and project sequence from the second quarter to the third quarter. As a result of the mix of work in the segment caused by these shifts, the strategic decision to reduce certain activities within our offshore operations and challenges on a now complete midstream project in the quarter, segment margins were pressured. However, we expect a meaningful increase in operating margins for the second half of this year.","As disclosed in our press release this morning, during the quarter we shuttered our pipeline inspection research and development operation and took a charge associated with the exchange of a construction barge for an industrial property.","We will continue to look for ways to optimize our Oil & Gas segment operations to push our margins to the high single-digit level on a full year basis. It is worth noting that Stronghold had a record quarter in first half of the year from both a top line and margin perspective. Stronghold is fully integrated into Quanta, and we could not be more pleased with the addition of such an excellent management team and high quality organization.","Further, we are beginning to see some of the growth synergies we highlighted when we announced the acquisition, such as leveraging their downstream storage tank construction and maintenance capabilities into our midstream customer relationships. We continue to expect Stronghold to achieve their financial targets for this year and have increased confidence in their opportunity for profitable growth over the coming years.","Our larger pipeline projects are ramping significantly in the third quarter, and we expect to have all of our large diameter spreads in the Lower 48 utilized this quarter and into the fourth quarter. That said, recent developments subsequent to the end of the second quarter associated with the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project or ACP causes us to believe some portion of our 2018 work could get pushed into 2019, which is prudently reflected in our guidance. However, additional work awarded to us on Line 3 in Canada, which we recently announced, as well as other projects are expected to backfill that potential slippage this year.","Looking forward, we see opportunity for robust overall pipeline market in 2019 and beyond. As natural gas mainlines from the Marcellus and Utica shales are built and placed into service over the next couple of years to provide market access. We believe natural gas production will grow and our midstream operations in the Appalachian region will experience increased activity.","We are seeing multiple pipeline opportunities driven by LNG and petroleum export development in the United States and Canada, and believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these growing markets. Additionally; increasing oil and natural gas production in Texas is outstripping available pipeline capacity. We're actively building midstream infrastructure in West Texas and a number of other pipeline projects in various stages of permitting and development to move oil and gas from West Texas to market.","We have strong midstream and mainline pipeline capabilities and are actively pursuing these opportunities. That said, we are diversifying and building our base oriented services, which we expect to be the majority of our Oil & Gas segments revenues this year. We believe doing so results in a more stable and consistent business profile over time that is less dependent on the timing and cycles of larger pipeline projects.","Quanta has strategically focused on diversifying its operations across service lines and geographies in a very deliberate manner. This approach has designed to help mitigate many aspects of our risks in our business, including customer, project, permitting, geographic, execution, weather and other risks. We believe Quanta's diversity, scope and scale and capabilities are unique in our space and set us apart both operationally and as an investment. Quanta is a construction led infrastructure solutions provider and we believe our portfolio of companies, services and geographic diversity position us to profitability grow through various cycles over time.","In summary, the first half of the year was solid and the second half of the year is strengthening. We're executing well in our strategic plan, which is allowing us to expand our capabilities to capture and perform a larger proportion of our customer's capital and operating spend. While project permitting and regulatory challenges remain, we continue to have a positive multi-year view of our end markets and believe we have strengthened our opportunities for multi-year growth.","As highlighted in our earnings release this morning, over the past several quarters, we have repurchased $254 million of common stock under our $300 million stock repurchase program. We are committed to generating value for our stockholders through operational growth, profitability improvement and the return of capital.","We are focused on operating the business for the long-term and we'll continue to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership. We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's diversity, unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset is the foundation that will allow us to continue to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO for his review of our second quarter results. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today we announced record second quarter revenues of $2.66 billion, a 20.7 increase as compared to the second quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to common stock was $74.4 million or $0.48 per diluted share compared to $63.8 million or $0.41 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure was $0.59 for the second quarter of 2018 compared to $0.50 for 2Q 2017. This year's net income and earnings per share figures all represent records for Quanta's second quarter performance.","Certain items impacted the second quarter of 2018 and were reflected as adjustments in Quanta's adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock calculation. These items had been disclosed in today's earnings release. The net favorable impact of which was $0.01 per share on GAAP diluted earnings per share.","Electric Power revenues increased to 20.7% when compared to the second quarter of 2017 to $1.57 billion with double digit or near double digit growth across all sub-segments of our Electric Power services. This increase was primarily due to higher customer spending associated with both transmission projects and distribution related services including continued favorable progress on a large transmission project in Canada.","Additional contributors were an increase in communications infrastructure services of $21 million, approximately $20 million in revenues from acquired businesses, $13.6 million of incremental Emergency Restoration Service revenues and approximately $10 million in revenues related to more favorable foreign currency exchange rates.","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment increased to 9.3% in the quarter as compared to 8.7% in the second quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher segment revenues including the previously mentioned large transmission project, on which we continued to perform favorably as well as incremental Emergency Restoration Services.","Aggregate communications infrastructure services operations, which are currently included within our Electric Power segment had slight losses for the quarter but performed incrementally better than the first quarter of 2018. We expect profitable operating performance for our aggregate communications operations for the rest of the year, with margins improving sequentially through the fourth quarter.","As of June 30, 2018 our remaining performance obligations were estimated to be approximately $5.58 billion, approximately 80% of which is expected to be recognized in the 12 months subsequent to June 30, 2018. Also as of June 30, 2018 12-month non-GAAP backlog for the Electric Power segment was a record $4.3 billion, which is up slightly from the first quarter and was an increase of 17% when compared to the second quarter of last year. Total backlog for the segment was $7.1 billion, which was an increase of 6% when compared to 2Q 2017.","We believe these increases reflect the continued strength of our end markets and opportunities which Duke referenced in his comments.","Oil & Gas segment revenues increased 20.7% when compared to the second quarter of 2017 to $1.09 billion. This increase was primarily due to incremental acquisition revenues of approximately $195 million contributed by Stronghold which, as mentioned by Duke, was ahead of our expectations.","Revenues were also higher from increased numbers of smaller transmission and distribution projects, however, these increases were offset by lower contributions of larger oil and gas pipeline projects. As a reminder, many of our larger pipeline projects last year were performed in the front half of the year which contributed favorably to the second quarter of 2017. For 2018 the majority of large diameter pipeline work will begin in the third quarter and continue into the fourth. This has a substantial impact on the comparability of quarters.","Also, as we discussed on a webcast at a June investor conference, certain large diameter pipeline projects we had previously expected to begin mobilizing on in the second quarter were delayed to the third quarter due to the timing of permitting.","Operating margin for the Oil & Gas segment decreased to 4% in 2Q 2018 from 7.5% in 2Q 2017. As previously discussed, this quarter's lower contribution of larger project revenues negatively impacted resource utilization and pressured margins. Additionally, operating income and margin were negatively impacted by harsh weather conditions experienced on a midstream project in the Northeast, which has been completed, as well as slight negative impacts from projects where change orders were not yet deemed probable for recognition.","Lastly, as disclosed in today's earnings release, the charge associated with the construction barge and severance and restructuring cost impacted this segment for a combined $4.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by the earnings of Stronghold, which we acquired in July 2017. As of June 30, 2018 12-month non-GAAP backlog for the Oil & Gas segment was $3.2 billion, which was an increase of 19% compared to the first quarter of 2018 and an increase of approximately 86% when compared to 12-month backlog at last year's second quarter.","Total backlog for the segment was $4.4 billion, which was an increase of approximately 80% when compared to total backlog at last year's second quarter. We continue to see the opportunity for additional awards and expect our backlog levels can remain strong. Corporate and non-allocated costs decreased $4.2 million in the second quarter of 2018 as compared to 2Q 2017, primarily due to the favorable impact of a $6.3 million change in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities during the three months ended June 30, 2018 and a $3.8 million decrease in professional fees primarily related to lower information technology costs.","Partially offsetting these favorable impacts were $6 million in higher compensation related cost associated with increased personnel to support business growth, annual compensation increases as well as higher stock-based compensation based on increased forecast attainment of multiyear performance targets.","In aggregate, consolidated revenues increased $456 million or 20.7% when compared to the second quarter of 2017. Consolidated operating income increased to $13.2 million or 12.1% compared to the second quarter of last year and adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure grew 11.7% or $20.8 million to $198.6 million. For the second quarter of 2018, cash flows provided by operating activities were $156.5 million and net capital expenditures were $74.2 million resulting in $82.3 million of free cash flow. This compares to negative free cash flow of $45.9 million for the second quarter of 2017.","This improvement was primarily due to the timing of cash payments on AP and accrued liabilities and in part due to lower working capital requirements related to lower levels of ongoing large diameter oil and gas infrastructure projects. DSOs were 74 days at June 30, 2018 compared to 76 days at year end and 80 days at the end of last year's second quarter. These decreases were primarily due to the timing of cash collections associated with two larger electric transmission projects, one of which experienced billing delays in prior periods and the other has favorable advance billing terms in the current quarters.","During the quarter, we repurchased 600,000 shares of our common stock for $20 million, based on the trade dates of the transactions and subsequent to quarter end we repurchased 300,000 additional shares of our common stock for $10 million. With these repurchases we have acquired a total of 5.9 million shares of our common stock for $203.9 million in 2018.","Under our current $300 million stock repurchase program we have acquired an aggregate of 7.2 million shares of our common stock for $253.9 million leaving approximately $46.1 million remaining unused of our repurchased authorization. At June 30, 2018 we had $120 million in cash. We had $840 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and $440 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding leaving us with $650 million in total liquidity as of June 30, 2018.","Turning to our guidance, we now expect consolidated revenues to range between $10.35 billion and $10.75 billion. This increased range contemplates Electric Power segment revenues of $6.15 billion to $6.35 billion. Within this segment we see revenues to be the highest in the third quarter and the fourth quarter to be sequentially lower due to typical seasonal trends.","We believe operating margins will grow to double-digits in the third quarter and fourth quarters. We continue to expect full year 2018 operating margins for the Electric Power segment to range between 9.5% and 10% with our communications operations continuing to be slightly dilutive to overall segment margins.","We now see Oil & Gas segment revenues ranging from $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion. We expect revenues and margins will strengthen in the third quarter, aided by the expected increased revenues from large diameter pipeline construction activities and continued improvement in our gas distribution and base business with fourth quarter revenues declining moderately or remaining comparable to the third quarter.","We now anticipate Oil & Gas segment operating margins between 5.4% and 6.4% for the year. This margin expectation reflects the $4.6 million in charges recorded in a segment during the second quarter. We anticipate net interest expense for the year to be approximately $33 million. As we have previously discussed, our other expense line item includes the deferral of a portion of the profit from construction activity on projects in which we have investments. We now expect the other expense line item to range between $35 million and $45 million for the year, primarily due to better than expected production uncertain of those projects.","We are projecting our effective tax rate for 2018 to be between 29% and 29.5% for the year. These operating ranges result in net income attributable to common stock of between $320 million and $382 million, and adjusted EBITDA of between $825 million and $926 million for the full year of 2018.","Due to our year-to-date share repurchase activity, we are now assuming around 154.9 million weighted average shares outstanding for the year. We are reaffirming our range of GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock for the year to be between $2.07 and $2.47, and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock to be between $2.55 and $2.95.","Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share presented in our release.","Please review the outlook expectations summary on our website for additional details. We believe our expected results for the year continue to reflect our opportunities for growth and our commitment to maintaining our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. We feel we are operationally and financially well-positioned and continue to focus on our ability to execute on strategic initiatives.","This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line to Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Our first question comes from Noelle Dilts of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Noelle Christine Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning, and congratulations on the quarter.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Noelle Christine Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So my first question is entirely related to Oil & Gas, there are a few parts here, but you commented that you expect all of your spreads to be utilized here over the next couple of quarters. Is that even if some of the work on Atlantic Coast pushes into 2019 as you referenced?","And then the second part here is, is given this acceleration in the mainline pipeline activity and the tightness we should see in the market over the next two quarters, are you starting to see better terms, conditions and pricing on contracts? And also are you at all concerned about the availability or cost of labor in any regions?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Noelle, for the comments. In general, I think that the \u2013 I'll start with the spreads. I think as far as where we sit today even with the push at ACP, we will be fully utilized, we're fully mobilized out in construction. Now, the sequencing of where we're at is certainly different than we expected. But that's \u2013 so it's a back half story. We thought we would be farther along in the first half and we're not, but we're starting now and we're starting to move forward over there just some of the work would push into 2019 on ACP.","As far as terms, we have good terms, we're confident in what we've done and how we de-risk the work. I won't get into details on them, but we're happy with our contracts, we're working with our clients. It's a daily barrage of something going on from a regulatory standpoint on most of our work in the Northeast, so we continue to work with our clients. But I'm optimistic that we're going to get this pipe built this year and we're going to have a good projects on all of them. And we're real excited about what we're doing on our large diameter pipe.","And as far as availability of people, one of our companies is 100 years, the other one is real close to it. So the amount of people and resources and if we rely strictly on execution, I love our chances. So we have really, really good longstanding people and superintendents and people want to work for us, so we're excited about with that as well.","Noelle Christine Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And then I wanted to shift over to the communications work, some interesting comments there. So, first, your expectation that you'll kind of exit the year at high single digits margins, maybe doesn't sound new, but you sounded a little bit more confident overall in that business. Is that a function just of the natural acceleration of some of these programs that you've been awarded or is it a function of picking up the cities that you referenced? And then if you could comment on you talked about your quality and timeliness. What do you think you're doing better than others?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, Noelle, I think a couple of things. When we got in the business, we knew there was a void. Until you get in the business and you start talking to clients, you don't understand how big it is or how big the void may be. After time in the business, we've talked with clients at the very highest level, and they're really \u2013 from our standpoint, our ability to put craft skill labor in the field is exceptional.","And so they recognize this; they recognized our ability to get work done, and done timely and cost certainty on the work. So that being said, I think we're set up to do that, as well as anybody or better than anyone, and they recognize it. So when we talk to them, when we're talking about those things. I think our acquisition of Northwest (sic) Lineman, our training, they see that, they've recognized that. So when we go in and say where are you going to get your workers from, they realize that we have a training facility we're working with them to put resources in the field and craft skilled labor in the field and we're not just talking about it.","So we're actually out executing. We're executing on our strategy and the communications. I really like where we sit. I would say that some of the drag and it is \u2013 the amount of cities that people are asking us to take, we have to be cognizant of getting people in the field. But at the job level, we're doing really, really well. I think we'll get scale out of these offices very quickly. And as far as the macro market, it's really good. I want to be clear that it's not about the market. The market's really good and there's a lot of work out there and people are doing really well, and I'm confident. It's just this is where we're at in our marketplace for us, and where we're going. And it's all about getting those craft skilled labor guys to the field and construction started.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, folks.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Good morning, Tahira.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, Duke, first question is let's strip out all these large projects that permitting wise make things work, move around, can you talk a bit about the baseload business in terms of your expectations at the beginning of the year and what you said in guidance and how that is performing and how that has influenced your guidance at this point in the middle of the year?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. Tahira, on the baseload business on the gas side, it's exceptional. We talked about the Stronghold contributions in the first half of the year. They've done \u2013 they beat our expectations, record year for them, done really, really well. I think it's overshadowed a bit by the larger projects and the timing so you have a mix of work that's not normal, so you're seeing some. In the Oil & Gas segment, it's not somewhat the margin profile a bit. And I think that will clear up in the second half.","But as far as the baseload work, we're exceeding our expectations on every level and every service line. Telecom's a little bit behind on the margins, but it's minute and it's due to the fact that we're ramping in multiple cities that we didn't think we would be ramping in. On a job level, we're right on track and that'll clear up and be better in the second half of the year. So, as far as I see it, our baseload business, we're growing high-single digits to double digits like we said we would. We're operating the company just like we said we would. I don't see any pause in it.","If you look at the CapEx, OpEx budgets of the companies that we serve, they continued to grow. You continue to hear multiyear, 10-year type work on grid modernization on gas replacement. We continue to see it, hear it from every customer we talk to, that comes out daily if you listened to earnings reports yesterday out of utilities' customers, there was one that said 10-year build, we're in year one. So and it's a large customer around the Northeast, I'm not going to get in their business but you're welcome to look around and see who announced yesterday. But, no, we're really excited about the business.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, that's good to hear, Duke. And I guess second point, when I look at your guidance; on the upper end which you've kept intact, that really showcases a very healthy earnings power on a quarterly basis close to a dollar and cash EPS. Is that something you can sustain and grow in a sense going forward beyond 2018?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","I mean Tahira, I think the business is set up like we said we publicly stated what we think from a growth profile on our base business, how these major projects layer in. You know that's something that it's very difficult to predict, if you look at it over time. But the macro markets there the bigger projects are there, where not \u2013 90% or 85% of our businesses is this baseload work, that 15% gives us the most trouble in forecasting, and the most trouble in giving you clarity, but the macro market and those big jobs are out there, that we're not a large project on the other side of the world company, those jobs happen to be there, those jobs are there all the time. They've been there for the last seven or eight years, and they're getting bigger and we're executing on them.","On West Fort McMurray in Canada is a great example of a big project that we're executing on. East-West Tie that we've announced, it's on and on and on, it layers onto that 85% that we're doing really well. And our MSA business is only getting bigger. The multi-year MSA work is out there and it continues.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. It's Alan Fleming on for Andy. Duke it seems that the amount of environmental pushback at the state and local level regarding big pipelines is as high or maybe even higher than it's been. Does this surprise you in the context of what expectations were when the Trump administration took office and what do you think you can do to protect yourself from the volatility in that market?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","I would say in general I see it a little different. We're mobilized on every one of our jobs \u2013 not one job is canceled. In the past administration, we had jobs canceled; we had jobs not get there. So we're mobilized on every job. Now, when you get there, there's still some state environment kind of rules and regulations that get challenged. And so we're working through those. It's nothing that's stopping the job. It's just ways that we need to de-risk ourselves and mitigate issues in the field with our client. We knew that going into it, our guidance reflects that. But I feel really good about where we're at and we get better every day, it continues to clear up every day.","We have better contract terms today than we've ever had for Texas. I'm excited about the work out there. I continue to believe the administration is wanting jobs created and work to go in the field and we're starting to see some of that \u2013 ACP is going; Mount Valley, there was a good court ruling yesterday on it. Lots of projects are getting good rulings. There is some noise in them, but they're minor, it makes a lot of news but it's not a major deal in the field.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And just on Stronghold, I mean you said it was running ahead of expectations or what you've thought in the first half of the year. You didn't raise guidance there. So, is that just some conservatism or do you think that the high end or even higher of that $575 million to $600 million revenue guidance is achievable now with what you've seen through the first half of the year?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, the guidance in the Gas segment has everything to do with our large diameter pipe. We're about 25% in the season. As we work through the season this year, that's where the prudency in our guidance is, as stated in the call, in my script. We have prudency built into our guidance due to where we're at from a seasonality standpoint in big pipe, we're very early. And we're 25% into it. That's not normal from a season standpoint. We would typically be farther along, but due to some of the delays and getting to the Right of Way and our Canadian build coming in; it's a late build this year. So I think as we get through the third quarter, you're not seeing the underlying \u2013 we can look at the guidance, we can look at where we're at on big pipe as we work through contingencies.","Also when you look at, you can't see the strength because of where we sit with big pipe of Stronghold in our other companies, but we would say $600 million is achievable. And they're exceeding expectations from a margin profile.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chad Dillard of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning, guys.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, I'm just trying to understand the moving parts behind the guidance raise. Revenues are raised by about $300 million, but we're only seeing call it $6 million of EBIT increase. That would imply like a 2% margin on those revenues, which is in my mind \u2013 I mean I thought it would be a little bit higher. Maybe you can unpack what's going on there?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","We're in the early stages of our large diameter pipe, 25% into it. We took a prudent approach to the guidance on the back half and I'll let Derrick comment on the numbers.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, it's also because when you think about from an Oil & Gas perspective, you saw some of those revenues coming in here in the second quarter versus our original expectations. But then we had some of the headwinds here in the second quarter, so that ate up some of that margin contribution.","The rest of it's coming in the back half, from an Electric Power perspective a little bit higher; overall though our margin guidance has remained intact. We did a little bit stronger in the second quarter. Looking at the back half of the year though what we're just saying is, is that we have no reason to change our overall Electric Power expectations, but those expectations when you look at the first half of the year, we've done quite well, so to that end we're just being a little bit prudent in the margins for the back half the year there.","And then the last, there's still that $100 million implied increase to the back half of the year, which as Duke spoke about is largely due to the new awards, but to the extent that of those new awards we haven't even begun to execute on those, those won't really start until here in the month of August. And we've got to be thinking about how we go through the winter type work. So to that end that's the prudency that Duke's referencing.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And then just moving over to telecom; you mentioned that you're seeing progress towards high single-digits as we exit the year. Just trying to get a sense for how we should think about those segment margins as we head into the following calendar year? Are we at a kind of like sustainable run rate from 4Q and can we kind of drag that into 2019?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","I mean my expectation for the telecom businesses in 2019 to operate at parity to the electric margins.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","I will say and I would expect that there'd be a level of seasonality to that like you see in Oil & Gas and Electric Power generally speaking, but to Duke's point we'd see and look at the overall contribution via parity.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","We're ramping, so I hedge a bit to say that if we ramp, continue to ramp on major cities and things of that nature, you could have some timing differences, but in general it'll be a good thing long-term. So, we're able to ramp fairly quickly. Our curriculum and the things that we've done from our college and such things we're able to get people to the field much quicker, which was a design and why we invested so much in training because we can get people to the field much quicker than we have in the past. So we're excited about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. On the large electric transmission side, last quarter I think you said you were set to finish up the 2 to 3 projects you had in backlog by mid-2019. Is this Site C large enough to keep that business steady in the second half of 2019, or do you still need to book more in that large site you mentioned $3 billion of bids outstanding and if you do need to book some more of that, how confident are you, you can do it?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","I think if you look at Canada Site C is a nice project, we have East-West Tie which is a large project. So those two backfill some of West Fort McMurray; West Fort McMurray finishes up in the early part of the year I guess mid-part of the year. So in general, there is projects that we have been awarded both Site C and East-West Tie. But there's a multitude of projects coming out of Canada that are large in nature that we're looking at today that are in tender phases. And also in the U.S., us being geographically diverse, let's just look at a lot of different large projects, if you go back in time the company's been on as many as 10. We're doing what we're doing with one; so there's many, many projects out there and I can't say enough about how large the MSA build of these CapEx and OpEx budgets are. We don't announce them every day; we just never have as a policy, but they're out there and they're large and they're multi-year.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay that's helpful. And then on the Oil & Gas side, can you maybe just talk a little bit more about the timing of the potential contingency releases you have on some of these pipelines you're working on. And I think we see some of those by the end of the third quarter or are those going to be more pushed into the fourth quarter?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","We evaluate our progress monthly on all our work and as we get through, as we operate through what we believe is contingencies we'll let them out or not. It's just we need to operate through that. It's a tough part of the world to work in, West Virginia in that area is we've got a lot of work in the hills and the mountains. And so, we'll be prudent about how we do it. We're going to get through that and we want to make sure that we get through it and I'm not in any hurry. We're going to get through the work and we'll let you know as it progresses.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","The other point being as is that each one of those items is done on a project by project basis. Each project is very unique and so we have to evaluate the contingency progression across each of those projects, irrespective of the passage time.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I would agree with Derrick's comment. Each one of those jobs are bid differently and they have different kind of contract. So, we'll have to look at each one of them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, great. Thanks, guys for taking my question. I wanted to ask about actually Western Canada, this is an area where production is actually increasing there, basis differentials have blown out. There's been some big pipelines sort of that you guys have passed on that have gone to other contractors. But I just wondered, given that this hasn't been a particularly active market for you in the last couple years, I don't think. Is it starting to improve in your outlook and could that be a contributor as we move into 2019, if there's anything specifically that you're looking at there to help boost the pipeline business?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think when you look at Western Canada, the Montney region and your takeaway LNG, both coastal and trans-mountain.","Those are both really, really nice projects. It takes a lot of capacity whether we build them or not. And the risk profile of some of that larger work out there is tough and we stay pretty disciplined, we stay real disciplined onto our models on bidding and again we don't win them all. But with the resources going out and the way it's working in the mining region, I do think that if those projects go, even if they don't go, you'll see work coming out of that shale basin it's prolific there, probably as good as the Permian.","So if we can get it to market, I believe, you'll see a lot of Midstream and a lot of large diameter pipe just going to bigger lines in the load centers. We see that there's record usage of power in BC, I believe yesterday. So lots of things going on in BC that we see; we need some good regulation up there that allows energy to go forward, the market itself to go forward. I think when you look at it, you look at the oil sand differentials and things that are happening. Pipes necessary, they're behind and they've got to catch up. So I really like the future there. We see a lot of good opportunities in Canada. In LNG it's only a plus.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Right, great. And then Duke \u2013 no, actually Derrick, if you could just talk a little bit about the contingent liability release. I think maybe you said the segment, but I don't know if you did, if you could just refer to kind of why would segment which acquisition if that's tied to an acquisition, any color there would be helpful?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think you're referring to the change in the earn-out expectation. A lot of that's actually driven. We call that the project, the Midstream project itself that had some headwinds this quarter, a lot of its tied to that individual project for that individual acquisition, which we have to go through and assess the probability, EBITDA realization and in this particular case it's a cumulative calculation, so with this particular shortfall was from our standpoint really impacted our ability to say that, that liability was now currently probable. So, it's a mainly for midstream type work in the Northeast.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. First question I think you said in your prepared remarks that this year mainline pipe will represent 10% to 15% of total revenues. Is there any way you can help us with like what your assumptions are in the back half of the year versus the first half or where that stood relative to 2017. So, we can better understand the margin implications and then the other thing besides the weather issue in the Northeast, you called out I think a change order or something like that. Can you just quantify the impact on the margins for me and just timing of that? Thank you.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. Jamie, I think in general I would say, I'll let Derrick quantify \u2013 run the numbers, but in general we're behind, we're 25% into it I would say and if you look if you go back inversely to 2017, we were probably more like 75% something like that well ahead of where we're at today. I don't know the exact math, but it's at least 60%. So, call it 60% so we're that far behind as far as I'm concerned. And in general, if 2017 was much more frontend loaded than this year, we're way back loaded in the back half. We're real close from the way we're forecasting to last year on big pipe. And I do think as we get forward, we'll exceed the amount of big pipe this year than we did last year.","So, I'll now let Derrick comment to the numbers.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. To that extent I mean one of the things I comment too is that it's a little bit like 2016 if you think about the back half of 2016 versus the front half of 2016. That's kind of a comparable what you're seeing here 2018, which is almost exactly the opposite of what you saw for 2017. And then, I guess relative to the margin dynamics here for the second quarter, part of it was the push out against our original expectations of the timing of some of the work which we referred to both in the June investor conference, as well as our prepared remarks.","We had a little bit of the weather impacts on the midstream project, I'd say that's probably a 70 basis point to 80 basis point impact to the quarter. As well it's not as though actually that was the only place we had some weather impacts, we actually did have some weather impacts in Australia, as well as some level of breakup impact. But the larger portion of which was the midstream project, we had the charges in the quarter which is about $4.6 million.","And then lastly on the change order recognition, I'd say that, that probably impacted the quarter profitability by again maybe the 50 basis point, 60 basis point, 70 basis point range. So, all of those things kind of aggregate are representative of the difference in our expectation.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you I'll get back to queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning, guys. Can you give us a little more color on large transmission biding, and is the best chance for incremental awards, you think that's pushed out to 2019?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","I wouldn't say that, I think it's constant. We see large products daily and again we see big projects and we're, some of them are in tender phase, some of them are in negotiation phase, some of them will be in 2019. It's all over the place, but we referenced about a $3 billion type in house. We're looking at bidding, negotiating type number on big transmission projects and that's the number. Where they're at and how long they take, it just \u2013 I can't tell you. I know that we're negotiating then we're not going to put a timeline on it. But the markets there, in the MSA market that we don't talk about \u2013 that we don't talk about, or we don't say it's a big project, those MSAs are in the billions of dollars, they're not little bitty MSAs. So I want to be clear.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. One other incremental point, I think it's worth noting that they're \u2013 relative to our revenue, guidance as it stands here today, we do not need any additional large awards in either Electric Power or Oil & Gas to come through relative to our current guidance. So anything would be incremental for this year at this stage.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Okay. Understood. And then you referenced taking share in telecom, would you say you're taking share from public players, private players or both?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. We don't look at \u2013 I don't look at it like that. I mean, I know what we're doing, I know the cities are, I can't tell you exactly who the market was or who we took them from, I have no \u2013 I don't know. I'm worried about us and how we execute and that's all I'm worried about. I have no idea.","Operator","Our final question comes from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.","Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thank you. Hey, Duke, with some of the kind of continued slippage in ACP schedule into 2019, and just kind of considering the stated capacity, how do you think and plan for life, ACP, in other words is this schedule kind of continues to shift right a bit, does that impact how you pursue or kind of bid for the next inevitable large job out there today?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Look, I think in general what we ACP goes into 2019 for us too, we have some I think a couple of spreads to work or more in 2019 for ACP as well. So where it's a long \u2013 it was a two year project to begin with. We tried to forecast some of the work in 2018, and some of the work in 2019 because that's when we were kind on our schedules. But when we look at that I mean it's a couple spreads that'll be there for two years. We are picking up incremental work at times that doesn't meet the threshold to make the news every day. But we do pick up incremental work, we're still building work \u2013 we're still building midstream work, we can move crews on and off those projects to do other things. It's just when you start talking about the mountains of West Virginia and North Carolina only a certain amount of people can do that. And, we tend to shy away from anything that's risky like that unless we have the right kind of superintendents to run them and right now if it's Mountain work we're booked.","Brent Edward Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Yeah. Okay. And then Fort McMurray just given the size of that project and then it runs I think you said earlier mid next year, could we see margin contribution from that job pick up even further it sounds like it's executing well or are you kind of running it at optimal levels on that job today?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","We're doing really well in that job. We we're executing like we should, we got to work through the winter here. And look there's opportunity for us to continue to execute well there, there's more opportunity on that job for sure. We'll see where it goes. We take a \u2013 we look at it quarterly, monthly we look at it all the time about where we're at. Some of the things that get de-risk as we de-risk that job. We look at it and evaluate what's it going to take to finish it and then bring it in here. I think it's more of getting through the winter here in the second half.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session.

Duke?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services fourth quarter and yearend 2016 earnings conference call. On the call, I will provide operational and strategic commentary before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who'll provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","We finished 2016 on solid footing, with significant revenue and profitability momentum in the second half of the year. While I'm pleased with this substantial improvement, we're not satisfied and remain committed to returning our operating margins to historical levels. Our third and fourth quarter results demonstrate progress towards that goal and our commitment to realizing the long-term earnings potential of the company.","We ended the quarter with record 12-month backlog. I would note that our backlog does not yet include various projects we have been awarded that have ongoing permitting requirements, and which have an aggregate contract value well in excess of $1 billion. We are confident that these projects will move forward and expect to include them in backlog when we have better visibility into final contract terms and probable construction starts.","The American election and the potential positive impact the new administration's policies could have on our business has created a lot of press and speculation. We are hopeful that the regulatory reform will progress and owners permitting and approval processes will ease. It is important to note however, that our end markets and related project opportunities do not rely on government funding to move forward and any additional government infrastructure support is incremental to our positive multi-year outlook. We remain committed to providing dynamic and self-performed infrastructure solutions to improve America's infrastructure.","Electric Power segment revenues for the quarter were comparable to the fourth quarter of 2015, however, operating income and margins for the segment showed solid improvement. We continue to have a positive long-term outlook for our Electric Power segment, and believe we are entering an upward multiyear cycle. The end market drivers we have spoken about for some time continue to spur demand for our Electric Power Infrastructure Services. These drivers, including the need to maintain and replace aging infrastructure, generation mix shifting to more renewables and natural gas and regulation aimed at improving the reliability of the grid, are what we believe will continue to provide opportunities to grow our base business.","Based exclusively on these projects, we are working on and have in backlog, our larger transmission project revenues should increase in 2017 as compared to 2016. Additionally, we believe larger transmission project awards will likely increase over the next 18 months, and should this occur, could provide improved visibility for the next several years. I believe we are uniquely well-positioned to provide solutions for these potential projects, some of which are the size and scope the industry has rarely experienced.","The macro environment in Canada has been challenging for the past couple of years for both our Electric Power and Oil and Gas operations. However, we are seeing signs of recovery that could have a positive effect going forward, such as the Alberta Utilities Commission approval of the Fort McMurray West 500 kV Transmission Project in Canada, which we expect to start full-scale construction in the second half of this year.","We have adjusted the cost structure of our Canadian operations as we move through these challenges, and we'll continue to do so as necessary. We are positioned to increase profitability, compete on our track record for safely executing projects on time and on budget, and we remain disciplined on pricing and project risk.","It is important to note that we do not operate our business to just accept only what the market brings us. We continually strive to innovate our solution offering and remain well ahead of industry trends. Our success in doing so over the years has played a critical role in establishing the leadership position we have today. I believe our scope and scale and competitive distinction in the markets puts us in a position to provide solutions that our end markets did not have in the past. We've valued the collaborative relationships we have with our customers, and we'll continue to partner with them as they execute their capital deployment plans.","Turning to our Oil and Gas segment. Revenues were strong, and operating income and margins increased substantially in the fourth quarter versus the same quarter as last year. Though we experienced some project timing issues on larger pipe projects during 2016, the year largely played out as we anticipated with the second half of the year being meaningfully stronger than the first, driven by a significant increase in larger pipeline project activity.","We have been in active discussions and negotiations on a number of large pipeline projects that depending on construction start timing could give us incremental growth for the second half of 2017. While we expect to generate more larger pipeline project revenue in 2017 than in 2016, we believe 2018 could be even better and that the next several years could be a very good larger pipeline markets.","The vast majority of pipeline opportunities we see are driven by the need to move natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale regions to various demand centers. However, we believe out-year larger pipeline projects opportunities could include larger oil and natural gas pipeline projects in Canada. These projects will provide desperately needed takeaway capacity for resources to access various markets in North America and meet the need for natural gas to fuel LNG export projects on the West Coast of Canada.","Additionally, development of liquid-rich natural gas formations in the Montney and Duvernay shales is beginning to increase demand for midstream infrastructure that could provide opportunity for us later this year. If production volumes increase over time, larger pipelines would also be needed to reach various end markets. Quanta's pipeline operating units are some of the most established and respected companies in the industry and are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities as market activities increase.","In addition to larger pipe projects, we see opportunity for our base business to continue to grow over the coming years. Our base business includes supporting midstream infrastructure, downstream support services, natural gas distribution, pipeline integrity, pipeline logistics management, horizontal directional drilling and engineering. Like our electric operations, larger projects complement our base business in this segment and we continue to develop unique infrastructure solutions for our customers.","For example, we recently completed the REX Zone Three Capacity Enhancement project for the Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, where we provided turnkey engineering, procurement and construction services for the installation of three new compressor stations and the upgrade of two existing compressor stations. This project is an example of our base business services providing a solution that led to a larger project.","And finally, on our first quarter earnings call last year, we announced that following the expiration of our telecom non-compete arrangement in December 2016, we intended to resume broad activity in the U.S. telecom infrastructure services market. We have done that.","A strength of Quanta is our ability to be opportunistic and one of our strategic initiatives for the long-term growth is to find adjacent markets and new market opportunities. Over the past several years, we have performing limited telecom and telecom-related infrastructure services in the U.S., consistent with the terms of our non-compete arrangement. At the same time, we have been growing our telecom infrastructure service operations in Canada by leveraging our electric power resources, reputation and relationships. We have also successfully greenfielded and grown our telecom infrastructure services operations in various Latin American markets. There's a natural progression of these efforts in our success to expand our telecom infrastructure services operations in the U.S. market, which we believe offers significant long-term growth opportunities.","In light of a trial scheduled this week in the litigation around our non-compete, we will not be, as we had previously expected, in a position to talk more fully about our U.S. telecom expansion strategy on this call. Once the litigation has concluded, I will comment further about our U.S. telecom expansion strategy. That said, I would note that we do not believe there is any merit to the plaintiff's claims. In the pending litigation regarding the non-compete, the plaintiff has informed the court that it does not intend to seek any lost profit damages as a result of Quanta's activities. On December 3, 2016, the non-compete expired and Quanta is currently not subject to any restrictions on providing telecom infrastructure services in the U.S.","In summary, overall, we had solid operating performance in the fourth quarter and believe the momentum we experienced in the second half of 2016 should continue into 2017.","Our guidance announced this morning reflects growth expectations for both the Electric Power and Oil and Gas segments over the next 12 months. As we typically do at the beginning of the year, we have taken a prudent approach to the revenue and margin range expectations in our guidance to reflect what we believe are possible outcomes based on the risk inherent in our business. As the year progresses and we gain better visibility in our performance, project timing and industry dynamics, we will adjust our guidance in commentary if needed. That said, we remain committed to and are strategically positioning Quanta to profitably grow over the longer term.","I hope my comments this morning have confirmed that we continue to have a positive multiyear view of end markets we serve. We believe we are entering a renewed multiyear up cycle for our Electric Power and Oil and Gas operations and are confident that we are well positioned to provide unique solutions to our customers.","Our qualitative outlook for our business is largely shaped by our collaborative relationships with our customers, which give us valuable insight into their multiyear infrastructure capital programs. We are focused on operating the business for the longer term and continuing to distinguish ourselves through safe execution and best-in-class field leadership.","We will pursue opportunities to enhance Quanta's core business and leadership position in the industry and provide innovative solutions to our customers. We believe Quanta's unique operating model and entrepreneurial mindset will continue to provide us the foundation to generate long-term value for all our stakeholders.","We faced some challenges this year, and our employees performed well in a tough environment. As we close out 2016 with this call, I want to recognize their efforts and thank them for their commitment to supporting Quanta's unwavering dedication to health, safety, the environment and quality. We ended the year with more than 28,000 employees who I believe are the very best in the industry. They are the key to our past and future success.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his review of our fourth quarter results. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting a 10.7% increase from the fourth quarter of 2015.","Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock was $88.5 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to common stock of $2.6 million or a loss of $0.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Impacting the quarter and reflected as adjustments in Quanta's adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation were tax benefits of $20.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share, associated with the release of tax contingencies as a result of the expiration of various federal and state tax statute of limitations periods. These benefits were partially offset by approximately $8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, of asset impairment charges primarily due to a pending disposition of certain international renewable energy services operations in our Electric Power segment.","This compares to a $6.6 million property and equipment impairment charge reflecting the last year's fourth quarter results. After last year's charge and through 2016, we evaluated various avenues for profitability improvement, but determined near the end of 2016 that the disposal of these operations best fit our ongoing strategy. We would expect no further losses associated with these assets.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to common stock, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.56 for the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $0.30 for the fourth quarter of 2015.","Also negatively affecting the fourth quarter of 2016 were litigation costs incurred of approximately $6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, resulting from Quanta's defense of allegations that it violated the non-compete agreement entered into in connection with the disposition of certain telecommunication construction operations in December of 2012. The trial scheduled for this matter was aggressive, and a significant amount of discovery was compressed into the latter half of the fourth quarter.","The increase in consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 was primarily associated with an increase in the size and number of larger oil and gas pipeline projects that moved into full construction in the latter half of 2016. Also contributing to these increases was a favorable impact of approximately $25 million in revenues generated by acquired companies, primarily in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment.","Our consolidated gross margin was 14.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to 11.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase was driven by substantially improved margins in both segments, which I'll discuss later in my prepared remarks.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were $173.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, or 8.3% of revenues, reflecting an increase of $22.1 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase was primarily due to $8.3 million in higher incentive compensation costs associated with levels of profitability.","We accrue incentive compensation proportionate to the levels of income for the year. Therefore, the accrual in the fourth quarter of 2016 was much higher based on the higher operating income and the proportion of 2016 operating income represented by the quarter.","Other increases include the previously mentioned higher legal costs, higher salaries and benefits from increased personnel and annual compensation increases, as well as incremental general and administrative costs associated with the acquired companies.","To further discuss our segment results, Electric Power revenues were comparable quarter-over-quarter with approximately $15 million in incremental revenues from acquired companies and slight increases in emergency restoration service revenues, offset by less power plant revenues due to the completion of the Alaskan power plant earlier this year as well as the timing of electric transmission projects.","Operating margins in the Electric Power segment increased to 8.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Operating margins were impacted by 45 basis points in 4Q 2016 and 201 basis points in 4Q 2015 by items described in the notes to our segment results as presented in today's earnings release. Aside from these items, operating margin improvement reflects better utilization of certain large transmission resources and improved performance on ongoing projects.","As of December 31, 2016, 12-month backlog for the Electric Power segment was comparable, while total backlog for the segment increased 2.1%, both as compared to September 30, 2016. As compared to the fourth quarter of last year, total backlog for this segment increased to 5.5%.","Oil and Gas segment revenues increased 35.1% quarter-over-quarter to $821 million in 4Q 2016. This increase was primarily due to the number and size of projects that moved into full construction in the latter half of 2016, and approximately $10 million in incremental revenues from acquired companies. The increase in revenues from larger projects also drove the substantial operating margin increase to 8.1% in 4Q 2016 from 3.9% in 4Q 2015.","12-month backlog for the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment increased by 3.4% when compared to September 30, 2016, and by 30.7% compared to December 31, 2015. Total backlog for this segment as of year-end is $3.1 billion.","As Duke commented in his prepared remarks, we had been in active discussions on a number of pipeline projects, which gives us confidence that backlog in this segment will remain strong.","Corporate and non-allocated costs decreased $47 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to last year, primarily as a result of a $51.9 million charge recorded in 4Q 2015 associated with the goodwill and intangible asset impairments discussed in today's release.","We closed the year with significant cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2016 of approximately $184.2 million, leading to net repayments of $124.6 million under our credit facility.","The fourth quarter operating cash flow contributed to $381.2 million in total cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations for the year. Net capital expenditures of approximately $190.6 million for the year resulted in approximately $191 million of year-to-date free cash flow. This compares to free cash flow of approximately $434.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.","The decrease in cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations in 2016 was primarily due to additional working capital requirements associated with the increase in the size of oil and gas infrastructure projects that move into full construction in the latter part of 2016 and the impact of the invoicing challenges and billing delays on an electric transmission project in remote regions of northeastern Canada, which we have discussed in previous calls.","The overall AR and unbilled position for this project remains at levels comparable to the third quarter of 2016 in part due to the recognition of some changed orders and, to a lesser extent, claims associated with customer scope changes and access and delay item.","However, we are working very collaboratively with the customer, which has led to significant improvement in invoice processing. In addition, the stronger fourth quarter 2016 cash flows benefited from improved cash collections on this project, with continued favorable progress thus far post year-end. Despite the larger balances here, DSOs were 74 days at December 31, 2016, compared to 79 days at September 30, 2016, and 75 days at December 31, 2015.","At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $112.2 million in cash. Also, we had about $305.6 million in letters of credit and bank guarantees outstanding to secure our casualty insurance program and other contractual commitments. And we had $351.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, leaving us with approximately $1.27 billion of liquidity as of December 31, 2016.","Turning to our guidance for 2017. For the full-year 2017, we expect consolidated revenues to range between $7.9 billion and $8.5 billion. This range contemplates Electric Power segment revenues increasing between 5% and 10% from 2016 levels, driven in part by the recent approval of the Fort McMurray West Transmission Project. Oil and Gas segment revenues are expected to range from revenues remaining comparable to 2016 to growth of around 10%.","As discussed in last quarter's earnings call, current 12-month backlog for the segment has 2017 construction activity weighted towards the first half of the year. The low end of revenue guidance for the segment therefore requires no additional larger pipeline awards. However, active discussions with customers lead us to believe that additional awards are available which could provide second-half construction opportunity.","As it relates to seasonality, for consolidated revenues, due to the timing of larger pipeline projects, we could see substantial quarter-over-quarter variances in 2017. We believe there will be quarter-over-quarter consolidated revenue growth through the third quarter of 2017 with revenue growth in the first quarter likely exceeding 20%. I would generally assume revenues will increase through the year from the first quarter into the second and into the third, although we anticipate less of a seasonal effect.","As we forecast today, we would say that even at the high end of our forecasted revenue guidance, we believe there is likely a meaningful decline in consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. We currently estimate operating margins for the Electric Power segment will be in the low to mid-9% range, and Oil and Gas segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 5% and 6%.","We anticipate seasonal effects will continue to impact our margins, with the first quarter operating margins for both segments expected to be lower and margins rising through the third quarter. Both segments will likely see operating margin compression in the fourth quarter, or perhaps more so in the Oil and Gas segment, due to the potential meaningful revenue decline.","We estimate interest expense will be approximately $10 million for 2017 and are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate for 2017 to be between 35% and 36.5%. Contributing to the lower projected tax rate for 2017 is a higher mix of international earnings, which are generally taxed at lower tax rates. In addition, a change in GAAP accounting will now require companies to record all tax effects related to stock-based compensation at settlement through income tax expense rather than through equity.","It is anticipated that we will experience increased period-to-period volatility of income tax expense as the calculation is based on the stock price as of the date of vesting, which is difficult to estimate. We expect this GAAP accounting change will impact Quanta's first quarter results more significantly than subsequent quarters, and could reduce the first quarter tax rate to as low as 32.5% to 33%.","We are forecasting minority interest for the year to be between $1.5 million and $2 million. Our annual 2017 guidance also reflects the current foreign exchange rate environment. Fluctuations of foreign exchange rates could make comparisons to prior periods difficult and could cause actual financial results to differ from guidance.","For purposes of calculated diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, we are assuming around 156 million weighted average shares outstanding.","We currently anticipate GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year to be between $1.52 and $1.77 and anticipate non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.80 and $2.05. Our forecasted non-GAAP measures are estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release.","CapEx for all of 2017 should be approximately $210 million to $225 million. This compares to CapEx for all of 2016 of $212.6 million.","Reflecting on 2016, we ended the year with record fourth quarter revenues, record annual Oil and Gas segment revenues and record 12-month backlog. We experienced solid improvement in our Electric Power segment operating margins, and as expected, realized significant second half improvement in our Oil and Gas segment operating margins.","We finalized repurchases of stock under our accelerated stock repurchase program in April of 2016, successfully acquiring 35.1 million shares for $750 million at an average price of $21.36. This concluded our two-year buyback effort totaling 71.7 million shares for $1.7 billion at an average price of $23.72.","Despite this significant deployment of capital, we ended the year with a conservative leverage profile, and we believe that we are operationally and financially well positioned for continued profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.","We are committed to our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility which positions the company for continued internal growth and the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. We will continue to focus on the strong cash flow of our base business and on mitigating the more pronounced fluctuations in cash flow associated with the working capital requirements of larger projects.","Overall, our capital priorities remain the same, with the focus on ensuring adequate resources for working capital, capital expenditures and organic growth with an opportunistic approach towards acquisitions and other strategic investments.","This concludes our formal presentation and we will now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, and congrats on a great quarter.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thank you, Tahira.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thank you, Tahira.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. So first question is, Duke, I mean these pipeline projects, expected backfill second half potentially. I guess they're pretty fast done, so as we look at the timeline by which it's too late for them to contribute, I assume we're kind of safe as long as you book them by maybe June, July.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, Tahira. The market is robust right now with some of the other projects, larger projects going into construction. We're certainly optimistic that most of the projects on the back half will have the ability to fill it. We're a little bit worried with Canada, just the overall economy there. So, we'll be cautious on how we guided the back half with the Canadian market as it is. But we're optimistic that we can fill the back half here in with large pipe for the second half 2017.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay, Duke. And second question is in regards to the transmission side. You mentioned something pretty interesting which is, you're seeing projects that are of a size you haven't seen before in the U.S. Is it partly because they're now different in terms of how they're being structured, as in they're more merchant, or is there something more sizeable shaping up outside of that?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Really, Tahira, I think the industry is trying to move renewables across multi states, multi jurisdictions so you're seeing a lot of larger longer projects from a DC voltage even, AC voltage. So, you're starting to see us move across state lines, ISOs, independent operators. So as you start to see that, the projects get bigger, larger. Some of them are long in nature from a standpoint of the beginning to the end. So you hear a lot about them and nothing happens for a long time. So permitting, siting, all those things take a very \u2013 that's a long cycle on those larger projects. So, you hear a lot. We see a lot of them out there. We're around the edges. We're optimistic that a few of them will go over the next three to five years here.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thanks very much. And I'll hop back in the queue.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Great. Guys on the $1 billion of awards that you mentioned in the prepared remarks that were won in the quarter, I was hoping you could give a little bit of context. It sounds like those are pipeline driven, but could you talk about the split between electric and pipeline and the visibility at which, or the steps that need to happen for those to actually get permitted and therefore wind up in your backlog?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","I think the projects that on the $1 billion or $1 billion plus is primarily pipeline. We'll talk about them as we get a firm contract to start date to get the ability for us to understand the scope and the commitments that we have with our customers and be able to explain that in a firm nature, in a firm contract we'll, as they go into backlog, we'll make sure we communicate to the Street. But we're confident, these will go into construction.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Maybe just as a follow-up on the pipeline side. I guess you mentioned the kind of the out-year opportunity for Canadian-driven pipelines and clearly there's been the Trans Mountain, Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipe is getting some traction. Keystone is potentially back on the table. Enbridge is thinking about upgrading their Alberta Clipper lines into the U.S. I guess, Duke, from talking to the customers that you can talk to and looking at the market out there, how many or all of these do you believe can go? Or is that too much maybe offtake from Western Canada? I'd love to get your thoughts on the economics of those as well as the timing at which you might see some of those first ones start moving into backlog and then maybe into construction.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I'm not privy to obviously what the shippers are saying. But, I would say that in general, if you're moving heavy oil out of Canada, you want optionality. And I think as long as they are able to move to different geographic areas, you'll start to see pipe move. You're railing most of it now. So anywhere you have a rail line, it makes a lot of sense to have a piece of pipe. So that alone will create markets on both coast lines there in Canada. As we start to look to the lower 48 and some of the larger pipe here, same dynamics. Shippers want optionality and our clients are in a robust environment to build pipe and we see it in Canada and the lower 48. We're in great positions on both sides of the border there. We're optimistic. We like the markets in the next three to five years. It's robust in my mind from a bidding cycle, everything we can say about it. Basically, it's permitting delays and things of that nature that concern us.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter. I guess my first question relates \u2013 I guess just given the backlog that you have and your confidence that you can backfill the back half of the year within Oil and Gas, why are we still only sort of targeting a 5% to 6% operating margin for the year just given the visibility you have and the prospects that you have in place?","And then my second question, just with regards to the Canadian outlook, obviously, Fort McMurray, that's a \u2013 the approval is a good sign. But can you just help us with what your sort of assumptions are for the Canadian market in 2017 and then how would you characterize the potential for upside if you could frame that for us? Thank you.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you, Jamie. From the standpoint of you filling the back side and our margin capability there, I think utilization is a big part of that. As we fill it, we're optimistic that our margins will improve. We need to fill the pipe. We need to see it. We need to see it go. We'll be conservative until we do big pipes fast, book and burns fast. So we'll be cautious on how we guide to that. And as we fill it, we'll talk to you about it in the next quarter or the next quarter, whenever we fill it, if we fill it. Again, we're optimistic. The end markets are there, and I think we \u2013 I think, from our standpoint, we'll improve. Our guidance will improve as we move forward through the year.","On the Wolfmack (37:26) project in Canada, I think we would say, in general, that that does strengthen our guidance. And so, but from that standpoint, I'm worried about the overall economic position in Canada and just in general the pressing of the business as far as going down on our margins and what Canada can do to the overall business. So, we're cautious on the Canadian markets.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Jamie, I'll add one bit of color as well that it's a segment mix and seasonality. I mean, at this stage in the game, we have a fair amount of that pipeline work \u2013 majority of the pipeline work we have in backlog today loaded to the front half of the year.","And to that end, the seasonality of the rest of the business has a tendency to put pressure on margins. As we get to the latter part of the year, to the extent we see those awards, that's where you probably see the ability to see some of that expansion. But right now, we think it's prudent to guide to the margin range of that 5% to 6% until we see how those other mainline-type opportunities are playing and offset the seasonality.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Noelle Dilts with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Noelle Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, everyone. Good morning. I wanted to expand on that margin expectation conversation. So looking at your margin targets for 2017, both ranges are below the 10% to 12% targeted range you've been talking about for Electric and well below the 9% to 12% range I think you've been looking at in Oil and Gas. So can you just give us some thoughts on, are those ranges still targets over the long term, or has something kind of fundamentally changed in both of those segments that's shifting your thinking? For example, in Electric, how is the shift toward EPC driving your thinking around margin? Thanks.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think what I would say is that our goals and targets for both segments are still to be at or near the double-digit range. The biggest thing driving Electric Power is the headwinds relative to the Canadian market.","If you were to look at 2016 and remove the effects of the power plants, in Canada, the rest of the electric operations are operating solidly in the double-digit range. So, the headwinds right now are still the softness in the Canadian market. The larger transmission opportunities that we see here coming into 2017 in Canada obviously give us some potential for the upside.","With the remaining portion of the business, you're still dealing with some degree of headwinds, and we try to factor that into the overall range \u2013 factor in the degree of prudency to the overall execution. But again, it's pretty important, I think, to recognize the rest of the business is operating strongly in the double-digit range.","For the Oil and Gas segment, it's a complement in the mix of work. We've talked extensively over the last few years about how the degree of mainline opportunities and how they flow into the year will heavily influence our ability to be at the stronger margin profile. In our original commentary, over the years, has also \u2013 before we ran into some of the headwinds associated with the broader energy market, as oil prices might decline, the remaining portion of our business is still yet functioning in a depressed oil price environment to an extent, and that is putting pressure on some of the other areas of our business, working against some of the complements or upside potential we see on the mainline side.","So, as the mainline gets a complement of work that happens to be more spread through the given year rather than just being front-end or back-end loaded, as well as the mix of work and energy dynamics changing, we still believe that we can see upward momentum for those margins in the long term.","Noelle Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then second question. Could you update us and give us some thoughts on what your equipment spread utilization was in Oil and Gas Infrastructure in the back \u2013 in the fourth quarter and then as we move into 2017? And then also how are you thinking about the legal expenses moving into next year as well? Thanks.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. The spread capacity, Noelle, we're not at capacity in the either side. So, again, the way those spreads come on and off projects, it's very difficult to give you numbers. But in either case, we're not at capacity and certainly have room in the first quarter here and onward to book work. As far as...","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","The legal costs, as it relates to how it goes in 2017, I wouldn't anticipate right now anything truly abnormal. This was more from the fourth quarter accelerated timing. But as we go into 2017, we haven't factored into any substantial uptick or downtick in that regard.","Noelle Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Duncan with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","I want to dig a little bit more on this Oil and Gas margin. I think we're all kind of struggling with the delta between first half and back half of the year. I mean, it sounds like if we're talking 5% to 6% for the year, the back half probably got to be kind of in the 3% to 4% range. Is that in the ballpark of what you guys are thinking, kind of 7%, 8% first half and maybe, I guess, maybe 3% to 5% back half? Is that the way you're assuming in the guide?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","I would say that as we stand here today with the potential for the fourth quarter to have a lack of an uncommitted filling, as an example, then the fourth quarter is probably where you'd see the biggest portion of the pressure for the margins. So, I don't know if I necessarily say it relative to the entire back half of the year, but the third quarter has a tendency for us to have the highest overall margin profile because of the good seasonality. But yes, there could be specific softness in the fourth quarter if we're not able to fill it with other larger diameter work.","Matt Duncan - Stephens, Inc.","And then, Derrick, what are you assuming in terms of the rest of the Oil and Gas business outside a large pipe, because I would think that you would start to see that recovering as rig count has gone up here. And then last thing from me just on FERC with the lack of a quorum right now, is there anything in your backlog that needs a FERC order to move forward or how do you think that may impact you guys?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","On the first part, from the margins, the remaining portion of work, we haven't factored in any sizeable uptick in our margins there despite what we're seeing potential on a rig count type dynamic. I think it in our mind may be a bit too soon to have an expectations of 2017 immediate benefit, but we do look at that as a potential for the positive upside.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, Matt, and also just in general on the pipe margins and the seasonality, there's normal seasonality in the business. And so I think as you see us fill up work and execute, the margins have the potential to move upward and we'll be cautious about how we guide again. As far as FERC, our forecast, we don't need any large pipe to meet the midpoint of the range, so we're confident in our year-end guidance on the Gas side.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Alan Fleming with Citibank. Please go ahead with your question.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Derrick or Duke, can you guys talk about how much impact storm work or the storm that you talked about last quarter had on your 4Q results. I think the last quarter you said you expected storm work to be higher, but it might come at the expense of other electric transmission work. Maybe it seems like it was a little more modest than you had thought, but maybe can you comment on that and comment on if there were any delays that you saw in your Oil and Gas revenue this quarter because of that storm that had impacted, I think \u2013 that had been in 3Q?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yes. Storm came in at around $35 million for the quarter, maybe just slightly above what we had otherwise forecasted in our original thoughts for the year. But from a margin perspective, I mean, there wasn't any substantial difference realistically. If you recall, in our previous commentary, we had said that the number of customers that we were working for were customers that we've dealt with on a regular basis. And so from a strategic perspective, you don't see maybe quite as much upside from a margin perspective. So very much in line with our original expectations. And then overall for the quarter itself, I mean, just having some degree of seasonality which we had already factored in and expected to somewhat offset that margin expansion.","And then the second part of your question was kind of the timing. We did come in at the lower end of our overall revenue guidance, and most of that came out of the Oil and Gas segment. There was a degree of some level of push of that revenue from 2016 into 2017 some of which would have been attributable to some of the heavier rainfall.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah, and on the Oil and Gas side, it did impact some of those spreads, and we were delayed some time there. So you had some revenue impact there. And then the Southeast where the storm hit, we have a large concentration of day-to-day MSA-type work, and that work was delayed along with it. So there's some offset in the storm.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful, guys. And then shifting to Electric Power, I mean, if I look at your Electric Power backlog, I think on a 12-month basis, it's been relatively flattish for the last year. And I think it seems like your base business there, the small to mid-sized work has been growing at a pretty healthy clip. So, maybe you can comment on kind of what you're expecting in that base business in 2017, and if you combine that with some of the growth that you're, or the visibility that you seem like you have on the larger project side, I mean, what's your confidence that 12-month backlog here in Electric Power can grow in 2017?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","We see our customers expanding their capital budgets in multiyear fashion the next three to five years. You start to see visibility in those capital programs. So as that happens, we'll continue to grow that base business. The recurring revenue type MSA work will continue to grow with our customers' capital budgets. As far as the larger projects, as we see Canada, as you see Wolfmack (48:14) go in, some other larger projects that are out there, there's certainly the opportunity to win and execute on those. I do think the Electric segment is in a multiyear cycle, an upward cycle, and we're optimistic in the environment that we're in.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, just help me think through the moving pieces on the transmission margin guidance side. So, if I back out those one-time items you're talking about in 2016, I mean you're effectively guiding margins to be flat to down despite having more marginal transmission work. I know that you mentioned that there's some issues in Canada, but I'm just trying to understand, is Canada getting worse or is there issues with pricing, or is utilization coming down? Just trying to understand what the difference is between 2016 versus 2017 that's not leading to raise margins.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. No. There's nothing that's unique or specific. I think what we've just done is we've not factored in a market improvement in the Canadian environment. We know as we've talked through 2016, we saw a degree of stabilization. But I think it's too soon in the year to factor in some sort of distinctive improvement in the non kind of larger transmission side of the equation. We do have those larger projects that are coming in, specifically at Fort McMurray, but that's going to be kind of probably back-end loaded into the year.","And so the first half of the year, I think you still see with seasonality the aspect of being able to have some degree of margin pressure in the broader Canadian side of the equation. But we think we've got the ability to go through and potentially see some degree of upside to the extent that you'll be looking at. But I think it's just too soon in the year to factor that in.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just secondly, over to the Oil and Gas side of the business, can you just speak a little bit more about what your expectations are for growth in the base business either gathering or your pipeline distribution work? And then also with your additional year earnings guidance, is that including contribution from telecom expansion in the U.S.? And if so, how much? If you can speak about that.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. The base business on the gas side continues to improve like the LDC market, local distribution market with the PHMSA rules that are in place to repair infrastructure, we're in a good environment to continue to see CapEx in those markets. I think we'll continue to expand albeit off a smaller base. But that will continue to grow. As far as telecom, we have our Latin American and Canadian construction going. They're good markets. We have about $150 million to $200 million in our forecast that with those along with the Lower 48 here getting started.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead with your questions.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.","You talked about a little bit of a hole in Q4 2017 in terms of the large pipe projects. Does that situation get better as you move into 2018 and ACP gets started?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","We'll be cautious about how we talk about large pipe. The book and burn and the amount of regulatory process that's involved in those projects, they're distinct, and we need to make sure that we have them, we're moving and we're mobilized before we communicate on them. I do like the end markets in 2018. It's a robust market. I do think we'll fill up early and be able to talk more about that. If we get some ease on regulation through the administration, we'll continue to talk to the Street about, as we get more positive and move into construction. Those things slip three months, it's a big impact to us, and we'll be cautious about how we talk to you.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co.","Okay. And then I think somebody else asked it, but just wanted to ask again on the impact of oil prices and the rig counts being up. In any of your businesses, are you seeing an impact from that?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","I think the midstream business is a good business. We need to take away that capacity to go to the end markets. As you start to see larger pipe get built, you'll see the midstream pick-up and the rig counts, obviously, there's takeaway and we're starting to see more rigs, so you'll start to see all those things happen and we're optimistic in that as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Stefan Neely with Avondale Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Stefan Neely - Avondale Partners LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Good morning.","Stefan Neely - Avondale Partners LLC","Real quick, I wanted to follow up again on the margins for Electric in the back half of the year. Can you help me a little bit think through the impact of the ramp up of the Fort Mc job, I mean does that impact sort of your outlook or are you mostly expecting any improvement in margins to be offset sort of by headwinds in the market in general?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think that as I've said in my prepared comments, that we could see the margins rising into the third quarter. Part of that will be a contribution of the work associated with Fort McMurray, but at the same time, I think it's just broader to the seasonality of our business. I think I'd still factor in a degree of decline potentially in the fourth quarter, again just driven largely by seasonality. One individual project is not going to offset the broader overall segment seasonality is what I'd expect at this stage.","Stefan Neely - Avondale Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks. And for my follow-up, was curious if you guys have any update on any sort of cost recoveries from the Alaskan power plant job that you guys finished up last year?","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","We're continuing to work on those items. We had not anticipated those items to be solved in the latter part of 2016. We've not factored in any recovery of that into 2017. The work is ongoing. We're in the process of quantifying and having those discussions with the customer. But as of today, we're not in a position to quantify.","Stefan Neely - Avondale Partners LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys.","Derrick A. Jensen - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Alex Rygiel with FBR. Please proceed with your questions.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Duke, you had mentioned that you have resumed operations in telecom. I understand you don't want to talk about strategy. But can you update us on what activities you've resumed?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. We never got out of the telecom business, to be clear. We were always in the telecom business. We had certain things under the non-compete we cannot do. And basically, the primary drivers were we were the telecom contractor or the contractor in the lower 48. We have the ability to do that today. So as we move forward, you'll see us in that market on the general side of this, and not just the Electric make-ready work.","So we're optimistic. The market is good. It's a robust market. We built our Canadian operations and our Latin American operations. So we'll participate both in North America as well as Latin America. We like the markets we've stayed at all along. And I'll talk more about strategy as we move forward. I'll leave it at that.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And as it relates to the international, Latin America and Canada, can you just give us a little bit more color on kind of wireless versus wireline and how that business has been growing over the last two years?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. It's both. In Latin America, I'd say 70% wireline, 30% wireless. Canada is primarily wireline, and the business has been growing double digits plus year-over-year.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just to clarify, to what extent does fill in Q4 rely on Canadian project specifically in Oil and Gas? And sorry if I missed that earlier in the call.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah. I think in general, it does rely on some Canadian work to fill the back half, but again, I think the markets are there, the lower 48 could fill as well and bring the back half up. So the opportunity on both sides of the border are there in the back half.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then can you just frame the potential Oil and Gas backlog or revenue opportunity if you were fully utilizing all your large diameter spreads and max that on your regional gathering business? I'm just trying to think about whether you could add a couple of billion dollars to this business and get it to be on par from a revenue basis with the Electric business or is there just capacity constraint to prevent that from reaching that kind of scale?","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","We're building our base business nicely. The opportunities are there. It becomes \u2013 you're getting people constrained at some point and so you have to be careful about where you're at in the world geographically, mountainous terrain and the qualified personnel that we have in the field. And we'll be cautious about how we move forward in those markets due to the constraints on some of the people in the field. And we train people every day, we're hiring every day. So as we get people trained, we'll put them in the market and how fast we can do that will dictate how our revenues go in the future.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. I'll turn the floor back to management at this time for closing remarks.","Earl C. Austin, Jr. - Quanta Services, Inc.","Yeah.

Jim?","James F. O'Neil","Thank you, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Quanta's second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. I will start the call with an operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our second quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we welcome your questions.","Quanta continues to execute at a higher level. Our second quarter results reflect strong demand for our services and solid project execution. For the quarter, revenues increased approximately 6% and GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased about 22% compared to the same quarter last year. At quarter end, total backlog increased approximately 10% from last year's second quarter to a record $7.51 billion.","Our Electric Power segment continued to experience increased demand for electric transmission and distribution services. As we have discussed on our earnings calls for some time now, the electric power industry is investing at record levels to upgrade and modernize North America's power grid. Regulations to improve Red reliability, renewable interconnections, the impact of coal to gas generation switching and other industry dynamics should continue to drive the power industry's investments and electric infrastructure over the next several years. We have good visibility into a number of large transmission project opportunities through 2014 that we believe continues to provide a platform for growth. While we have some projects nearing completion, we have plans to mobilize resources to projects in California, Canada and the northeast United States. That current level of bidding activity on large transmission projects is at a level comparable to last year and at this time. We continue to believe the transmission market will be very active through 2014 and beyond, and revenue growth is likely, but we may experience short-term cyclicality quarter-over-quarter, due to the timing of project awards and project start dates.","In addition, smaller transmission project activity remains strong, primarily driven by the electrification of shale gas fields and subtransmission interconnections off the major [indiscernible] transmission project built over the past several years.","Our electric distribution activity continue to increase in the second quarter, and we expect this growth to continue throughout this year and 2014. We continue to add distribution crews for customers where we have existing master service agreements and are signing new agreements with customers on a regular basis.","In general, our customers are increasingly focused on distribution asset management initiatives such as reliability and Smart Grid [indiscernible], as well as great hardening programs in response to Hurricane Sandy and other major storms that significantly impacted power infrastructure last year.","Our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment revenues grew 14% this quarter versus the second quarter of last year and operating income increased over 80% versus the same period, resulting in a significant improvement in operating margin for the segment. We are pleased with the segment's improved profitability in the second quarter and we expect this trend to continue year-over-year.","Demand for pipeline services to support shale gathering infrastructure was active in the second quarter and should remain so throughout the year and for many years into the future, as customers continue to invest in infrastructure needed to support the development of unconventional shales, particularly liquid rich shale formations.","As highlighted in our earnings release this morning, during the second quarter, we were awarded approximately $550 million of mainline pipe projects from 4 customers. While we can't get into much detail about the customers or the projects, we estimate approximately $100 million of these revenues should be realized in 2013 and the remaining revenue should be realized in 2014 and into 2015. We are currently in discussions with these customers and other customers regarding additional mainline projects and are actively bidding on mainline work for 2013 and beyond. We continue to believe that the mainline project awards for the industry will be active this year and could accelerate in 2014. We consider our people to be the most experienced in the industry and with approximately 1\/3 of the industries mainline pipeline construction capacity, we believe we are well positioned to assist our customers in meeting their growing energy infrastructure capital plans over the coming years.","In our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment, revenues for the quarter decreased marginally over the prior period due to fluctuations in telecom services revenues. Within the segment, however, Fiber Optic Licensing activities are growing steadily with sustained margins and we continue to see solid demand for our networks in the markets we serve.","After the second quarter, we closed on the acquisition of 2 excellent companies: J.W. Didado Electric and Nacap Australia. J.W. Didado Electric is a full-service electric per contractor headquartered in Akron, Ohio and founded in 1958. Didado was a multi-generation family-owned business with strong customer relationships, a sterling reputation and an excellent management team. Didado brings Quanta an enhanced presence in the Midwest and along the East Coast, and Quanta will provide Didado with the financial and operational resources it needs to take its business to the next level.","Nacap Australia was founded in 1984 and is based in Victoria, Australia. Nacap is a leading energy infrastructure contractor that primarily provides pipeline construction and related services to Australia's oil, gas, water and power industries. The company performed services across the continent and has a customer base consisting of Australia's major energy developers. Nacap is led by a strong management team with deep experience and strong relationships in the Australian infrastructure markets. Nacap's reputation in the industry, their safety record and the company culture they've created has made this company a preferred employer in the industry in Australia. We believe Australia is an attractive market for Quanta to continue to expand and for years to come. The Australian market represents one of the most dynamic energy markets in the world, with coal steam gas, LNG and potential shale gas developments.","It is also economically and politically stable and is a U.S. friendly country with similar culture and rules of law. In addition, Australia is in proximity to a large growing economies in Asia such as China, which has significant energy resource demands that Australia can help supply over the long term.","More than $160 billion of LNG energy infrastructure is currently under construction in Australia. Australia also has a number of shale plays that have yet to be developed. According to the Energy Information Administration, Australia has the world's 7th largest potential shale gas resource and the 6th largest potential shale oil resource. The development of these shale resources could provide significant energy infrastructure opportunities for Nacap and Quanta in the future.","As we discussed in our earnings release, we have adjusted our full-year 2013 guidance. We increased the lower end and upper end of our guidance, primarily due to the strong performance of our field operations in the first half of the year and better visibility into the remainder of this year. We continue to reflect prudent expectations in our financial forecast, particularly in the fourth quarter, as the timing of electric transmission and mainline pipeline awards construction start dates and seasonality can impact our overall financial performance.","Consistent with our previous approach, we do not have any uncommitted mainline pipe construction revenues in our guidance for the remainder of 2013. While we believe there are opportunities for Quanta to book additional mainline work that could start construction this year, we will not include any mainline projects in guidance until we have signed contracts and a firm construction start date.","In summary, we had an excellent second quarter, and we are pleased with the momentum we see in our business for the rest of this year and beyond. We continue to believe we are in a multi-year energy infrastructure investment cycle that we remain well positioned in our leadership role in the industries reserve. We will continue to leverage this leadership position and execute on our strategic initiatives to grow both organically and through selective acquisitions as we actively pursue opportunities to expand the solutions we offer to our customers.","I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his financial review of the second quarter. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.47 billion for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $1.39 billion in the prior year second quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 6% quarter-over-quarter.","Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock in the quarter was $70.2 million or $0.33 per diluted share as compared to $57.9 million or $0.27 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Although in our previous guidance, included in our results for the second quarter of 2013 was approximately $4.3 million of expense or $0.01 per diluted share related to the accelerated vesting of equity-based awards associated with John Colson's retirement as Quanta's Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors effective May 23, 2013.","The growth and consolidated revenues in the second quarter of 2013 was led by a 14% increase in revenues from our Natural Gas and Pipeline Services segment, followed by 4% growth in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. Our consolidated gross margin increased to 16.4% in the second quarter of 2013 from 15.4% in 2Q 2012. This improvement was primarily driven by the second quarter performance of our pipelines segment as compared to last year's second quarter, as well as the impact of higher overall revenues, which improved our ability to cover fixed operating costs.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were $119 million, reflecting an increase of $13.8 million as compared to last year's second quarter. This increase is primarily attributable to $10.8 million in higher salary and incentive compensation cost, associated with increased levels of operating activity and profitability and includes a $4.3 million noncash compensation charge I spoke of earlier.","Also contributing to the overall increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was approximately $2.7 million in higher cost associated with our ongoing phenology and business development initiatives.","As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 8.1% in the second quarter of 2013 from 7.6% in the second quarter of 2012. Excluding the $4.3 million noncash compensation charge from 2Q '13, our SG&A percentage would have been 7.8%.","Our consolidated operating margin before amortization [ph] expense increased to 8.3% in 2Q '13 from 7.8% in 2Q '12. Amortization of intangible assets decreased from $9.3 million in 2Q '12 to $5.1 million in the second quarter of 2013, as certain of these assets became fully amortized, partially offset by increased amortization of intangibles associated with the small business acquisition during the first quarter of 2013.","To further discuss our segment results, the Electric Power segment's revenues were $1.05 billion, reflecting an increase of $40.3 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 4%. Revenues during the quarter were positively impacted by higher revenues associated with Electric Power Transmission and Distribution projects, which resulted primarily from increased capital spending by our customers. This increase is partially offset by lower revenues related to renewable energy projects as certain projects near completion during the second quarter of 2013 with limited new awards.","Revenues from emergency restoration services increased quarter-over-quarter with approximately $26.1 million occurring in the second quarter of 2013, compared to $12.5 million occurring in the second quarter of 2012.","At the end of the second quarter, 12 months backlog for the Electric Power segment decreased 4% to $2.68 billion as compared to the second quarter of 2012. Sequentially, 12 months backlog decreased slightly by 3% from the end of the first quarter of 2013 due in part to burn on certain electric transmission and renewable projects during the second quarter of 2013. Total backlog for this segment remains strong at $4.94 billion and we continued to expect substantial project award activity in future periods.","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment increased to 11.5% in the second quarter of 2013 as compared to 11% in last year's second quarter.","Natural Gas and Pipelines segment revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by 14% to $385.9 million in 2Q '13, primarily as a result of increased revenues from projects related to unconventional shale developments in certain regions of North America.","Operating income for the natural gas and pipeline segment as a percentage of revenues increased to 7.2% in 2Q '13 from 4.5% in 2Q '12, primarily due to continued performance improvement and more favorable project condition, as well as the overall increase in segment revenues, which improved the segment's ability to cover fixed and overhead cost. At the end of the second quarter of 2013, 12 months in total backlog for this segment increased about 16.9% and 47.3%, respectively, compared to the end of the second quarter of 2012. As we've commented before, Keystone XL is not in any of the backlog figures presented for our pipeline segment.","Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment revenues were down $0.4 million or 1% to $42.1 million in 2Q '13 as compared to $42.5 million in 2Q '12. Additionally, operating margin decreased to approximately 34% in 2Q '13 as compared to 36.3% in 2Q '12, primarily due to fluctuations in telecom project activity, as well as slightly higher overhead cost incurred in the 3 months ended June 30, 2013.","From calculating operating margins by segment, we do not allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization expense to our segments. Therefore, the previous discussion about operating margins by segment excludes the effects of such expenses.","Corporate and unallocated costs increased $2.7 million in the second quarter of 2013 as compared to 2Q '12, primarily as a result of the $4.3 million noncash compensation charge and $1.7 million in higher professional fees associated with ongoing technology development cost and business development initiatives discussed earlier. These increases are partially offset by reduced amortization expense of $4.2 million from previously acquired intangible assets that became fully amortized.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as calculated in today's press release was $0.38 for the second quarter of 2013 as compared to an adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.32 for 2Q '12.","Operating cash flow from continuing operations was approximately $118 million for the second quarter of 2013 as compared to cash provided of $108 million for the second quarter of 2012. Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from equipment sales, were about $79 million, resulting in approximately $39 million in free cash flow for the second quarter of 2013. This compares to $69 million in free cash flow for the second quarter of 2012.","Cash flow has been negatively impacted by sustained higher levels of working capital during the current period, which has adversely affected our days sales outstanding or DSOs. Our DSOs were 93 days at June 30, 2013 compared to 87 days at March 31, 2013, and 81 days at June 30, 2012. Contributing to the increase in DSOs were the effects of transitioning efforts to enlarge electric transmission projects during the period and certain larger projects approach completion, and therefore had declining revenues for final billings and retainers balances await settlement. However, other projects began during the quarter with billing milestones on current production having not yet been achieved.","We continue to focus on billings for all projects and reducing our overall DSOs. Also continuing to impact DSOs are the change orders associated with a summarized project, which remain in cost and excess of Billings.","During the quarter, we began formal discussions with the customer on this project pursuant to an agreed structured negotiation process. The customer has completed its audit of the project and we are in the process of responding to the customer's request for additional documentation. This process is proceeding on a slower timeframe than originally anticipated, and we currently expect this stage of the process to continue until sometime into the fourth quarter of this year. We continue to believe strongly in our position on this matter and we are not currently aware of any circumstances warranting adjustment to the amounts we believe are owed.","EBITA for the second quarter of 2013 was $117.4 million or 8% of revenues compared to $103.1 million or 7.4% of revenues for the second quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was $163.6 million or 11.1% of revenues for the second quarter of 2013 compared to $140.7 million or 10.2% of revenues for the second quarter of 2012. The calculation of EBITA, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA, all non-GAAP measures, and the definitions of these and DSOs can be found in the Investors and Media section of our website at quantaservices.com.","At June 30, 2013, we had about $179 million in letters of credit outstanding, primarily to secure our insurance program, and we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $363 million in cash, with approximately $151 million of the balance related to foreign operations. Considering our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we had nearly $884 million in total liquidity as of June 30.","Subsequent to the quarter end, we acquired J.W. Didado Electric, and their financial results will generally be included in our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. We also acquired Nacap Australia with their financial results to be generally included in our Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment. The aggregate consideration for both acquisitions consisted of approximately $118 million in cash, net of cash acquired and $763,272 shares of Quanta common stock valued at approximately $18.7 million.","As these acquisitions occurred after June 30, their impacts or results have not been included in any of our historical results, including backlog. However, their financial projections are included post-acquisition, and therefore, are included in our guidance for the third quarter and remainder of 2013.","Concerning our outlook for 2013, we expect revenues for the third quarter of 2013 to range between $1.65 billion and $1.75 billion, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be $0.39 to $0.41 on a GAAP basis. These estimates compared to revenues of $1.53 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operation of $0.39 in 3Q '12, which included a $7.1 million benefit from the release of income tax contingencies, positively impacting the prior year third quarter by $0.03 per diluted share.","Our GAAP EPS forecast for 3Q '13 includes an estimate of $7.5 million for non-cash compensation expenses and $7.5 million for amortization expense.","Excluding these expenses and deal cost incurred to-date, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from a continuing operations for the third quarter are expected to be $0.43 to $0.45, and compared to our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.42 in 3Q '12. This non-GAAP measure is calculated under the same basis as the historical calculations of adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in this release.","Consistent with guidance provided in our last 2 earnings calls, our guidance includes an expectation of approximately $100 million in emergency restoration service revenues for the year, with approximately $40 million to occur in the remainder of 2013. This compares to the record emergency restoration service revenues of $250 million in 2012 or $76 million occurring in the third quarter of the 2012 and $130 million occurring in the fourth quarter of 2012. We currently expect revenues for the full-year 2013 to range between $6.2 billion and $6.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.35 to $1.45 on a GAAP basis.","Our GAAP EPS forecast for 2013 includes an estimate of $35 million for non-cash compensation expenses and $26.4 million in amortization expenses. Excluding these expenses, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2013 are expected to be between $1.53 to $1.63.","We are currently forecasting net income attributable to noncontrolling interest to be approximately $3 million to $4 million in the third quarter of 2013 and around $16 million to $17 million for the year. For additional guidance, we are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate to be between 35.5% and 36% for 2013, and we expect our diluted share count to be around 214 million shares.","We expect CapEx for all of 2013 to be approximately $210 million to $225 million, which includes CapEx for our Fiber Licensing and other segments of about $35 million to $45 million. This compares to CapEx from continuing operations for all of 2012 of $209 million.","This concludes our formal presentation. I will now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tahira Afzal from KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First question is as you look at the pipeline side, clearly marked sequential improvement as well. So could you talk a bit about your capacity to the extent you can going into 2014 that is available as you look at your capacity right now? And really, the margin power we could potentially see from the 7% range, just driven by utilization to the extent you can approximate it. That will be very helpful.","James F. O'Neil","Well, I'll take the first question. I mean, we -- strategically, we've been positioning ourselves to take advantage of these big pipe opportunities, while maintaining our process in the shale. So we think we're well-positioned to take advantage of some big pipe work, which we have been communicating with -- start coming out toward the end of this year and into '14. I'll just tell you that we're not planning on turning on any opportunities in the near future. Our approach is going to be very similar to electric transmission, where we went from being on 4 jobs to over 15 and 16 projects in the 2-year period. So we're going to -- we're planning with customers. Many of these jobs are out in '14 and '15. We have founded to gear up our resources to ensure that we can meet our customers\u2019 expectations.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And as a follow-up, I guess, I just wanted to ask you about the guidance range, if you can sort of divide it up in between perhaps how much is related to the $100 million in pipeline, how much is really related to just the organic improvement and risk being identified and dissipated in the quarter and how much might potentially be coming from accretion of these 2 small acquisitions? And just as a segue to that, really, your strategic outlook on incremental acquisitions?","Derrick A. Jensen","Okay. Tahira, you have a lot there. The -- relative to the overall guidance, I'll start kind of from reverse and work backwards from an acquisition perspective, I'd say that relative to now and the end of the year, you'll probably see something in order of the magnitude of $0.01 to $0.02. The mainline pipe was not in our previous guidance. And so that additional award does allow for some level of accretion and margin expansion. We still see that our margins right now, as you kind of have a running of about 7% for the segment. So and then our Electric Power margins came in at about 11.5%. So the rest of it relates on the organic side to as much a view of a margin expansion for the rest of the year. We had been previously envisioning that we would be somewhere in the midpoint of our 9% to 12% as an example for our electric power. I think we've seen to the first and second quarters that that's a little bit higher, which gives us a little bit confidence into the third and fourth quarter. And then lastly, relative to acquisitions, we continue to view ourselves as a highly acquisitive company, and I think you've seen that through these 2 acquisitions, and we think we continue to see other opportunities that are out there along for further acquisitions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mr. Dan Mannes from Avondale.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","First, just a quick clean-up question on the second quarter in 2 parts. One, was there any large pipe in the pipe segment? And two, were there any material close outs in electric during the second quarter?","Derrick A. Jensen","Dan, this is Derrick. No we didn't have any mainline work that we performed in the second quarter. And relative to close outs, I mean, we always have some ups and downs associated with anything. A lot of them have to do with just better execution in production. There were some jobs that started to wind down but they didn't necessarily have any substantial material impact to the quarter.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then the follow-up again on the pipeline segment, you noted the $550 million of bookings on large, large projects, that's great. I think the curious part for me is how much if it is back end to '14 and beyond? Can you talk a little bit about the environment, whereby you are starting to see longer term awards like this, because historically, pipelines really has just been kind of a one year seasonal business. Is this indicative of a tightening environment or a change in strategy by the developers?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I think we've been saying it for quite some time. You can throw the traditional bidding season at least in this current cycle out of the window because many of our customers are trying to plan resources in a tight market and projects are also getting bigger. So you got to have a little bit of preplanning. I kind of lay it out on curiosity on '14 and '15. I would tell you that one of those projects, one of the bigger project is a '14, '15 build, 2 of the projects of the '14 builds, and then you've got the 2 projects that were started in '10, that'll -- or excuse me, in '13 that'll go into '14. That'll take a break during the winter and we start construction in the spring.","Operator","Your next question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","First question, let's stay with the pipeline. The awards that were provided, can you give us a sense of how many miles or that the underlying diameter that you've been working on there? And then secondly, just an update on the integrity portion of the business, how's that gravitating and if you won any new awards during the quarter?","James F. O'Neil","Bill, I'm not going to get into the mileage. I'll tell you that they're all large diameter pipe, 20 inch and greater, most of them 5 million [ph] the larger diameter than that. Second question?","Derrick A. Jensen","Pipeline integrity.","James F. O'Neil","Yes, pipeline integrity continues to gain momentum. I would say it's -- again, probably one of the areas of our business that's growing faster than any of our other parts of our business but on a much smaller base and we expect continued momentum over the next several years.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","And then on the Australian acquisition, can you give us a sense of how many spread these guys can currently operate?","James F. O'Neil","Right now, they've got 2 spreads of capacity.","Operator","Your next question comes from Will Gabrielski from Lazard.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","The Nacap acquisition, I'm wondering if you can talk about how that business might look over the next few years in terms of are you going to be on a big LNG project coalbed methane, coal seam gas project where you're hired under some sort of framework or alliance relationship and hundreds of wells that need to be drilled, and it's going to have a good amount of visibility, or should we be thinking about these as bigger job opportunities that we'll see come in a little bit lumpy?","James F. O'Neil","I think you look at it as a company that can provide all the services that Quanta provides today. Significant infrastructure, electric transmission, distribution, infrastructure, as well as pipeline infrastructure to serve both the LNG mining and coal seam gas infrastructure build out.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up, in the U.S., outside of the Marcellus, are you starting to be able to get any traction, any of the different shale basins that are out there and what's your outlook, I guess, within the Marcellus as well in terms of gathering activity?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean we continue to see a very positive environment in the Marcellus, the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, and we continue to gain momentum in all of those shales as we move forward. So nothing's really changed.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mr. Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. Obviously, the gas pipeline side is gaining some momentum. But there is a lot of concern around the large transmission side. You've seen some of the equipment guys like Hubble and ABB. Be slightly more cautious on sort of utilities spend in utility transmission citing 2013's the peak, as well as some industry experts. So can you talk about your thoughts about are you seeing any more cautious activity from your customers and should we think about 2013 as sort of the peak with the gas side of the business gaining momentum, picking up for that. And then also two, just in terms of a modeling question, it seems like the electric transmission side, the revenue side is sort of -- should we think it's sort of flattened out, I guess, should we think about sort of similar revenue trends in the back half of the year versus what we saw in the second quarter?","James F. O'Neil","Jamie, these product suppliers, they've got -- they sell their products globally and they've got international competition. I mean, I think it's just a whole different landscape than what we're seeing. We do not see what these guys are seeing. Some of them saying that the markets going down, 10%, 20%, we're just not seeing that. And I mean, if you ask me to compare gas to electric, I mean, I think, we said, we believe it's likely we have growth in electric. I mean, obviously, gas -- the pipeline segment has a bigger opportunity to grow into next year because of all of the mainline pipe opportunities, but that doesn't mean electric's not going to grow as well. And we do not see the peaking or slowdown that others are seeing today. Now, we caveat that, that because of the environmental landscape we're in today of the regulatory landscape we're in today for that project awards and starts can get pushed. But overall, we're looking at just as many projects today that are out there to bid or to negotiate than we did last year at this time. So we're not seeing that slowdown.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But can you talk about the size of the projects that you're bidding on because a lot of the growth historically has come or the projects that you have, have come from more renewable initiatives, which don't seem to have, I mean, there doesn't seem to be as many projects out there like that. So there are a lot of projects, but they're smaller and medium-size, or do you still see sort of the -- a good mix of the larger sort of the larger projects out there within the transmission side of the business?","James F. O'Neil","Jamie, there's some very big projects out there right now, bigger, bigger than what we've seen before, as well as a lot of smaller projects that are interconnecting a lot of the mainline backlog projects that we've been building over the last 2 years. So it's a good mix, but it's not that it's all small projects and more small projects. There are some big projects out there that are on the drawing board, that are going to be built over the next several years. And we feel very comfortable with our outlook that the business has the potential to grow, the transmission business has a potential to grow. Again, the only caveat is the regulatory constraints that our customers face, and have been facing for the last decade and more.","Operator","The next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Jim, the pipeline margins, very strong in the quarter and I think you said that, was sustainable. What gives you confidence that this kind of margins are sustainable?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I mean, we've been pursuing shale work for the last 2 years, we're executing on our strategy. We believe that our folks were getting better execution. We actually -- we did have some good weather in the quarter. And again, our job is to get as efficient as we can, and the margins continually improve as we do that shale work. And so we're really pleased with the outcome for the quarter. And like we said in the script, like I said in the script, we expect margins to get better year-over-year.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, I wanted to follow-up on Jamie's question about transmission, because she's right, there's so much negativity out there. I mean, is there anything -- one thing that was brought up was maybe FERC trying to lower the ROEs for transmission. I haven't really seen that. Have you seen anything like that?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, there's some great rate case challenges in certain areas of the country. But we still believe that's where our customers are going to get the higher returns even if the rate plays didn't play out the way they expected. Again, the main pieces of all of this is we have aging infrastructure, 2\/3 of it was built post-world war II. And it's got to get upgraded. Much of it's approaching its useful life. And that's what we're seeing out there. We're seeing these major transmission lines that are being built, and they're still on the drawing board. Like I've said repeatedly, we're still in the early innings of this game. And it's going to continue forward. And I do not see any downturn in the transmission business as we stand here today, and when we do, we will communicate that to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's clearly good to see these mainline awards, and I'm assuming they're fixed price. And so, I guess, maybe can you talk about what changes you guys have implemented since the last go around on the mainline projects to increase -- to improve your execution? And then, I'm assuming that these awards do reflect the good terms in margins that you've been patiently waiting for.","James F. O'Neil","Well, first, I wouldn't assume that all the works are fixed price. And secondly, we were patient and we build projects with the margins that we expect for the risk that we're taking. And thirdly, we're working with many customers that we have longstanding relationships with that understand the value of building a project on time and on schedule, and certainly, the terms and conditions between this are mutually agreed upon and are acceptable to us. So I think the execution problems we've had in the past have been largely due to extreme weather conditions, and we believe that we've got the very best people and equipment in the industry and looking forward to contributing value to our shareholders going forward. And that's about all I can say. There is going to be a good time for the pipeline industry throughout this year and into next year and beyond, and we're looking forward to facing the challenge.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then from a utilization perspective, I mean, with what you've booked now already and what you have in backlog on the mainline stuff for 2014, all else equal in that business, is it enough now to get you into that 9% to 12% margin range?","James F. O'Neil","We haven't given guidance for '14, but I would say that with the amount of volume you probably in that zip code if we can execute for '13. I would think that we probably need to secure somewhat a little bit more mainline pipe in order to get us into that 9% to 12% since we're only at $100 million right now, right now forecasted for the year. But there are additional opportunities, so we'll just have to see how that plays out.","Operator","You have a question from Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. On the Electric Power side, can you talk about what drove the upside at the last couple of quarters on margins of the margins [indiscernible] work about the solutions segment, and just talk about that. And also, on the pipeline side, I hear you talking about some more awards in the mainline work? Can you just talk about the [indiscernible] the number and the size of the contracts that you're bidding on in the second half of this year?","Derrick A. Jensen","This is Derrick. I think that your first question was really asking about our higher margins in Electric Power in the first quarter and second quarter potentially versus our original guidance. We've guided 9% to 12%, and then said that we thought we'd be kind of in a mid-forced in that range around the 10.5%. And primarily because of the fact that when we looked at 2012, our execution was very high and at times you saw us as being able to exceed our margins in 2012. We've said various times that we thought that it was aggressive on our part to come through and have the expectation, we've had that level of performance throughout this year because of just the last year's exceptional performance. But having said that, what we've found is that through the first quarter and second quarter of this year, we have been able to execute through at the same similar levels, even through the period, which is typically our lowest margin period, the first and the second quarter, often times hampered by weather, et cetera. So and just more we feel like on a go-forward basis that if we, to the extent we've been able to execute through the first and second, we think we have the ability to continue to see that into the at least the third quarter. As far as the...","James F. O'Neil","The bidding activity on the shale or pipeline, I would just say, it's high level of bidding activity right now, and we expect that to continue into '14 and beyond.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Rogers from D.A. Davidson.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Two things. First of all, just on the renewables portion of the business that you talked about being slower. How much renewables work have you been doing especially in 2012 and by comparison?","James F. O'Neil","John, we had probably a better year in '12 than '13. I know we did, we're probably down $100 million from $300 million this year. And then next year, there's lots of -- there' some opportunities out there, we just have to see how those play out. I mean, we're not dealing with light transmission projects, from trying to figure out whether we're going to do '14 or '16 or '17. We'll figure out whether we're going to be 1 or 2 or 3. So it kind of changes the game there, but there are some utilities shale projects that are being planned, we're hopeful that we've been working with developers now for months even years on projects that are supposed to go to construction or move to construction. So, but the thing about it, it's such a small part of what we do today that we could -- if things didn't play out in renewables -- I mean, certainly the other parts of our business will outpace it, I mean, it's probably less than 5% of the segment.","Right now, but again, it's still a focus point for us, and we're still well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities if they come here.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, just in terms of the margins in the pipeline business. They've been trending nicely higher for the last 6 or 8 quarters with the seasonality. Is that all pricing as opposed to just better utilization? And your revenues are up somewhat, but it looks like your margins are climbing a lot faster. Is that what's happening now, Jim?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I think it's mostly better utilization. I mean, when you establish yourself with a brand-new greenfield operation and open offices and start from scratch, and then you're going to gain efficiencies over time as you continue to build your revenue base and your customer base. And it's mostly on better operational improvement and better utilization of equipment over time because we've been working with the same customers over last 2 two years. Pretty much under the same MSA Agreements. So it's really just better execution and good weather, we had some really nice weather in the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Irwin from Wedbush Securities.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So the gasser is a segment, obviously things are cycling up and things are going very well as far as bookings and the overall trajectory on the bidding activity et cetera. Can you talk about whether or not you're getting more selective on the projects that you're bidding for there? And was there any specific piece of business that might not have been booked to this year versus last year because when we take out the 515 [ph] mainline awards we're actually down in the core bookings year-over-year, we know it's volatile, but just was hoping you could speak to that a little bit.","James F. O'Neil","Well, I'll tell you that we're not getting any more selective than what we've been over the past since we've owned Price Gregory. I mean, we've got pricing objectives and terms and conditions, objectives in our contracts, and we have customers that we have long-standing relationships with that will provide us for, that happen to have capital programs moving forward. So I don't think anything's changed there other than we're in a more robust environment now and moving forward with some opportunities.","Derrick A. Jensen","Relative to the second part of it, what I'd say is that we commented throughout the last a little bit that we're being a little less aggressive potentially in some of our shale pursuits, basically as I'm sure we have the management available to work on any of the mainland component that came available. As we look to now, I think what we've seen is that what mainline work we have, we know where those things will generally play out to the year and allow us to pursue additional of those opportunities in the shale side.","James F. O'Neil","And I do want to mention on this segment, we also have gas distribution services and we mentioned pipeline, integrity, briefly, but those 2 parts of our business are performing very well and growing as well. So all of the services that we provide in that segment are moving -- have positive trends in both revenues and margins going forward.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. So the second question I want to ask was really a housekeeping question. Can you share with us the approximate revenue run rate of your 2 acquisitions you closed this quarter? And maybe a backlog number that you might be looking at when you report backlog for these acquisitions at the end of the September quarter?","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure. From a revenue run rate perspective, I'd say something in order of magnitude of $250 million to $300 million on a combined basis. And then on a backlog, I'd say you're looking at something probably around about $150 million. So that's a soft number right now with that whole public conversion side of the equation and getting into these guys and talking to them exactly as how we define backlog versus them, but I'd say something in order of magnitude of $150 million.","Operator","The next question comes from Noelle Dilts from Stifel.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","First on the near pipeline project plans, is there any way, you can tell us if they're located in Canada or the U.S.? And then, could you just discuss what you're seeing in terms of the relative opportunity in Canada versus the U.S. and both transmission and pipeline?","James F. O'Neil","The project mix was probably half and half, half in Canada, half in the U.S. And I think the opportunities going forward are in both the U.S. and Canada are the same, it's equal. We're seeing opportunities in both countries.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I think I know the answer to this question, but do you have any updated thoughts or any sort of update on the Keystone XL project and where we stand on that?","James F. O'Neil","Not anything more than what TransCanada's put out publicly. That's all -- we have the same access to the same information that you have.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Rygiel from FBR.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","A couple of quick questions. First, any chance you could try to size the market in Australia? And then also, provide some comments on any opportunities you might be looking at in Mexico?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I would say that Australia is probably very similar to Canada, and how Canada has grown for us, when we made an acquisition in '10. So I think that's how I would put it in perspective rather than try to put a number on it. There's a lot of opportunities there and there's needs for significant infrastructure build out, and there's a limit today in a number of service providers that can meet customer's needs. So it's a huge job opportunity for us. The second, Mexico. Mexico is not -- really, I mean there's opportunities there, but we're just treading lightly there right now. There's plenty of opportunities to put our resources to work in other area.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then a quick question, any chance you could give us a vague description of the mix of your Electrical business between transmission and distribution?","James F. O'Neil","It's about the same as it's been. It really hasn't changed, Alex. It's probably x-renewables 65, 35","Operator","Your next question comes from Justin Hauke from Robert W. Baird.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So I appreciate you can't give a lot of details on the mainline work, but I was wondering just on the margin front, if maybe you could tell us what's the spread differential on kind of a unit margin basis relative to your existing gathering line work in the shales?","James F. O'Neil","The approach that we take on margins is driven by contract type. When we do a fixed price contract, there's more risk, margins are typically 300 to 400 basis points higher than at cost plus, so we're not taking risk. It's all about what type of risk you're taking, and that's across all of our segments. The spread differential. So when you do more electric transmission projects that are fixed price, it pulls your distribution projects, which are mostly cost plus and [indiscernible] price which are lower side into that 9% to 12 % OpEx range. And that's the same dynamic that we expect to happen on the pipeline side when we do core fixed price pipeline mainline projects.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. But to be clear, these mainline pipeline projects that you booked or that you're calling out are not all fixed price, correct?","James F. O'Neil","I wouldn't assume that they are. That's correct.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess my second question is, just thinking about CREZ and the fact that, that's been such a big project for lots of contractors and is immobilizing later this year. I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that your crews have homes to go to on other jobs. But I guess from an industry perspective, what are you seeing from your competitors that are there, and I guess how should we think about that impacting the pricing of new jobs that are being bid going forward?","James F. O'Neil","Look, all I can tell you is that this whole notion that CREZ is ramping up and there's plenty of people sitting around and pricing is going to be challenging. I mean, where our employee count is up 15% since the first year were at record levels, a lot of CREZ has already wind down. And we're looking for people to move on to other projects. So I don't know what our competition is doing, but I can tell you that we're very busy right now.","Operator","You have a follow-up question from Noelle Dilts.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This is just kind of a big picture question, but my work suggests that last year, the vast majority of transmission project awards over the last few months of the year. And just given what's out there it looks like that's similar this year. Is that consistent with you're seeing? And also do you think there's any reason that we're kind of seeing that trend?","James F. O'Neil","On the electric transmission awards?","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes. On the project awards -- a lot of them really [indiscernible] last few months, last year.","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean, I think people get -- they get hung up that we don't have an announcement every quarter or 2 quarters. And I'm just -- it's still a very robust environment. I don't get caught up in that. I look at what the pipeline of opportunities are and how that's going to replace or grow on the burn that we're experiencing. And I'm very comfortable that is likely that we're going to have growth unless we have some of these bigger projects that get pushed because of permitting or regulatory [indiscernible], which will happen to some degree, but there's a lot of opportunities out there. And I'm not getting hung up on announcements right now. We've got significant work ramping up right now in certain areas that's offsetting, CREZ ramping down, and we'll have other announcements that will come out into the future as we move forward.","Operator","Thank you, sir. There are no further questions. Please continue.","James F. O'Neil","Okay, I'd like to thank all of you for participating in our second quarter 2013 conference call.

Jim?","James F. O'Neil","Thank you, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. I will start the call with an operational overview before turning it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta's Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed review of our third quarter results. Following Derrick's comments, we will welcome your questions.","For the quarter, revenues increased approximately 7% and GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 10% compared to the same quarter last year. Our 12-month and total backlog increased both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis, and both are at record levels.","Our Electric Power segment continues to experience strong demand for electric transmission and distribution services. The electric power industry continues to make significant investments in North America's power grid to improve reliability, address congestion issues, create renewable interconnections and upgrade and replace aging transmission and distribution infrastructure. There are several near-term drivers of transmission spending.","As coal generation is retired to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, utilities will need to modify existing transmission infrastructure to handle changes in energy flow to maintain grid reliability. As a result, new transmission infrastructure will be required. For example, earlier this year, grid operator PJM, which manages grid reliability on an electric power system that serves more than 60 million people, identified the need for more than 130 grid updates to avoid reliability problems resulting from power plant retirements. PJM's estimate of $2.4 billion in expenditures to address this challenge includes equipment upgrades, new substation and substation upgrades, as well as rebuilding existing transmission lines and the construction of new lines.","Earlier this month, PJM approved an additional $1.2 billion in high-voltage transmission system upgrades and improvements to meet the challenging impacts of mother nature, such as Superstorm Sandy, and the ongoing reconfiguration of the grid associated with the shift from coal to natural gas generation.","We are also seeing significant growth opportunities throughout Canada and expect this trend to continue for several years. The drivers of transmission and distribution investment in Canada are similar to the United States and also include other drivers, such as the development of new or expanded hydrogeneration facilities, generating power to meet low-growth demands in Canada and for export into the U.S. market.","The current level of bidding activity on large transmission projects remains at high levels. For example, during the third quarter, we were selected by PPL to construct approximately 69 miles of 500-kilovolt electric transmission infrastructure through environmentally-sensitive and challenging terrain in Pennsylvania. Work has begun on this project, and we expect to complete the project in the spring of 2015.","As the industry leader in North America, we continue to have ongoing discussions with many customers and have good visibility into future opportunities. We anticipate that several large transmission projects will be awarded in the coming months. Keep in mind, for every large transmission project opportunity, there are a significant number of subtransmission and substation project opportunities. Construction associated with projects individually valued at less than $100 million remain strong and we do not anticipate any slowdown in activity for the foreseeable future.","Our proprietary Energized Services technology and work methods are being utilized by AEP to perform a 345-kilovolt energized reconductoring transmission project near Corpus Christi, Texas. Quanta is performing this work in an energized state to avoid service outages to AEP's customers during construction. This 66-mile project represents the longest span of transmission line in the United States ever built, while -- ever rebuilt while remaining in an energized state, and is the first of a 5-phase, 266-mile program. The second phase of this project is expected to begin in mid-November and was not reflected in our September 30 backlog.","The substantial emergency restoration service work performed in last year's third quarter, as compared to this year's third quarter, was the primary reason for Electric Power segment revenues being down slightly in the quarter. However, excluding the impact of emergency restoration work in both quarters, our electric distribution activity increased in the third quarter, and we expect growth to continue through this year and in 2014. We continue to add distribution crews for existing and new customers. Our distribution workforce has increased 50% over the past 18 months. The major drivers of our distribution services are storm-hardening initiatives, upgrading aging infrastructure and housing recovery in certain parts of the country. Overall, for our Electric Power segment, we believe our current backlog, coupled with project opportunities on the horizon, can lead to double-digit growth opportunities for at least the next 2 years.","Our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment revenues increased substantially this quarter versus the third quarter of last year, and operating income more than doubled from the same period last year, resulting in a significant improvement in operating margin for the segment. We are pleased with the segment's ongoing profitability improvements, as it reflects continued awards, solid execution and contributions from our efforts to expand geographically.","Demand for pipeline services to support shale-gathering infrastructure was active in the third quarter and should remain so through the year and for many years to come in the future, as customers continue to invest in the infrastructure needed to support the development of unconventional shales, particularly liquid-rich formations.","We have also commenced construction on 2 mainline projects in the third quarter. While these projects started slightly later than anticipated during the quarter, our forecast continues to include an expectation of $100 million in mainline revenues in the second half of this year in North America.","Also, as recently announced, Quanta was selected by TransCanada for the Houston Lateral pipeline project. Quanta's Price Gregory operating unit will construct and install approximately 48 miles of 36-inch diameter steel pipe to interconnect TransCanada's Gulf Coast pipeline to refineries in Houston, Texas. Price Gregory has a limited notice to proceed on this project, and we expect the substantial majority of this project to be performed early next year, with completion in the spring of 2014.","We remain in active discussions with a number of pipeline companies regarding mainline projects and are bullish on this market. As we have stated in the past, we believe that mainline pipe project awards in the United States, Canada and Australia will continue through and could accelerate in 2014.","Subsequent to the quarter, we acquired T.G. Mercer, which is based in Willow Park, Texas. Founded in 1910, Mercer specializes in pipeline logistics for the oil and gas pipeline construction industry. Mercer's field offices are strategically located in and near key shale plays in the United States. Mercer has developed a proprietary pipe-tracking system that enables pipeline owners to effectively track information pertaining to pipe infrastructure from the mill yard to final construction. This system provides pipeline owners with the solution to address growing regulatory concerns regarding traceability of information pertaining to their pipeline infrastructure. Mercer's industry-leading pipeline logistics and proprietary technology, coupled with Quanta's leadership position in pipeline construction, maintenance and integrity services, enhances our turnkey service offering, which we believe is unmatched in our industry.","In our Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment, revenues from the quarter decreased about 10% as compared to the prior year due to the fluctuations in telecom service revenues. Within the segment, however, we continue to see strong demand for our fiber optics services across all of our markets and from a wide variety of industries, including health care, media and entertainment, financial services, education and government, as well as wireless and wireline carriers. There's continued appetite for increasing bandwidth for business continuity, cloud computing, data center connectivity and private wide area network services. We continue to invest in our network to expand our service offerings to meet our customer's demands and to capitalize on new opportunities in the marketplace.","It's a dynamic time in the industries we serve, and we see a clear opportunity for profitable growth. One of our key strategic objectives is to leverage our leadership position and move into select new geographies and adjacent service lines. Over the years, we have strived to stay 2 to 3 years ahead of industry trends, enabling Quanta to capitalize on opportunities. We have successfully launched our renewable energy engineering, procurement and construction services group in 2008. We acquired a North American leadership position in pipeline construction in 2009. In 2010, we acquired Valard Construction, the leading electric transmission and distribution company in Canada, and we have subsequently completed the acquisition of several other Canadian C&D contractors. We acquired a pigging technology for pipeline integrity services in 2011, and made a sizable acquisition of pipeline -- of a pipeline construction company in Australia in the third quarter of this year.","Today, we are announcing an expansion into infrastructure services serving the offshore and inland water energy markets. We believe there are meaningful opportunities for us to penetrate these markets and replicate the services we perform today onshore. We are following several of our existing customers who own assets both onshore and offshore, and we are utilizing Quanta's expanded service offering to secure new customers, both onshore and offshore. Demand offshore pipeline infrastructure services is very similar to that on land, as the vast majority of the thousands of miles of pipeline and the related production facilities are at or beyond their useful life.","We believe the continued stringent regulatory environment that has affected our onshore customers will impact the offshore industry and should accelerate customer actions to address aging infrastructure. We believe the offshore oil and gas industry is a growing and vibrant market. However, we believe the infrastructure service providers in the offshore market lack the ability to provide sole-sourced solutions, including differentiated technologies that many customers desire. We see a clear opportunity for Quanta to grow in this market.","An integral part of this strategy was Quanta's recent acquisition of Performance Energy Services, or PES, which is headquartered in Houma, Louisiana. PES is a leading specialty contractor to the oil and gas industry, specializing in mechanical installations, fabrication of steel structures, commissioning and decommissioning services and electrical instrumentation services. PES is ISO 9000-certified and serves the Gulf of Mexico market and also has a presence in select international offshore markets, serving U.S. exploration and production companies.","In addition to the PES acquisition, Quanta has invested $24 million in certain multipurpose construction vessels to enhance our offshore oil and gas infrastructure strategy. These vessels complement the service offerings of PES, as well as our existing service offerings. The PES and Mercer acquisitions are included in our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment, on examples of our efforts to enhance our comprehensive infrastructure solution offerings for our customers and expand into adjacent markets that we believe will deliver profitable growth for our shareholders.","In summary, we had an excellent third quarter. And we expect 2013 to be another record year for Quanta. We believe the momentum continues to build in all of our end markets and we believe there's an opportunity for double-digit growth in 2014. Our employee count at the end of the quarter stood at a record 21,000 employees, up 18% from the beginning of this year. I want to thank our employees for their dedication to safety and their hard work. I believe we have the very best employees in the industry, and our people are the key to our past and future success.","I will now turn the call over to Derrick Jensen, our CFO, for his financial review of the third quarter. Derrick?","Derrick A. Jensen","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced revenues of $1.65 billion for the third quarter of 2013 compared to $1.53 billion from the prior year's third quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 7% quarter-over-quarter.","Net income from continuing operations attributable to common stock for the quarter was $92.9 million or $0.43 per diluted share, as compared to $83.6 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year. Included in our results for the third quarters of 2013 and 2012 were the release of income tax contingencies of approximately $6.6 million and $5.2 million of income, or a net benefit of $0.03 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2013 and a net benefit of $0.02 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2012. Both were due to the expiration of various federal and state statute of limitations periods and settlement of certain income tax audits.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, as calculated in today's press release, was $0.46 for the third quarter of 2013 and grew approximately 10% as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.42 for the third quarter of 2012. The growth in consolidated revenues in the third quarter of 2013 was primarily due to a 40% increase in revenues from our Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services segment, partially offset by a 4% decrease in revenues from our Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. Our consolidated gross margin increased to 16.6% in the third quarter of 2013 from 16.4% in 3Q '12. The increase in gross margin was primarily a result of improved performance and an increase in revenues from our Natural Gas and Pipeline segment in this year's third quarter as compared to last year's third quarter. This increase was partially offset by a $57 million quarter-over-quarter decrease in higher-margin electric power emergency restoration services revenues.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were $124.9 million, reflecting an increase of $10.4 million as compared to last year's third quarter. This increase is primarily attributable to $6.5 million of higher salary and incentive compensation costs associated with increased levels of operating activity and profitability. Also contributing to the overall increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was approximately $4.1 million in incremental and administrative costs related to acquired companies. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased slightly to 7.6% in the third quarter of 2013 from 7.5% in the third quarter of 2012.","Our consolidated operating margin before amortization expense remained constant at 9% for 3Q '13 and 3Q '12. Amortization of intangible assets decreased from $10.3 million in 3Q '12 to $7 million in the third quarter of 2013, primarily due to reduced amortization expense from previously acquired intangible assets as certain of these assets became fully amortized, partially offset by amortization of additional intangible assets associated with the 2013 acquisitions.","To further discuss our segment results, the Electric Power segment's revenues were $1.05 billion, reflecting a decrease of $40.2 million quarter-over-quarter or approximately 4%. Revenues were negatively impacted by a $57-million decrease quarter-over-quarter in emergency restoration services, with approximately $18.6 million occurring in the third quarter of 2013 compared to $75.1 million occurring in the third quarter of 2012. Additionally, revenues during the quarter were negatively impacted by a decline in activity related to renewable energy projects, as the prior year's third quarter had substantial contributions from a large-scale solar project.","In the third quarter of 2013, we neared completion on some smaller renewable projects, but due to the lumpiness on projects in this area, we've had few new awards. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenues associated with the electric power transmission and distribution projects that resulted primarily from increased capital spending by our customers. Also included in the overall increase in revenues for the third quarter of 2013 were approximately $27.5 million in revenues from companies acquired in 2013.","12-month and total backlog increased both quarter-over-quarter and sequentially for the Electric Power segment. Sequentially, 12-month backlog increased by 9% from the end of the second quarter of 2013, and total backlog for the segment is at a record $5.32 billion. Contributing to the increase in backlog is roughly $100 million from acquisitions in the third quarter. In addition, backlog increased due to incremental transmission awards, as well as the renewal of certain master service agreements.","","Operating margin in the Electric Power segment decreased to 11.7% in the third quarter of 2013 as compared to 12.6% in last year's third quarter, primarily due to the lower levels of higher-margin emergency restoration services in the current period, as well as last year's third quarter being positively impacted by higher-margin contributions from the large-scale solar project, which did not occur in -- recur in the current period.","Natural Gas and Pipeline segment revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by 40% to $552.4 million in 3Q '13, primarily as a result of increased revenues from projects related to unconventional shale developments in certain regions of North America. Revenues for the third quarter of 2013 were also favorably impacted by the contribution of approximately $56 million in revenues from the acquisition of Nacap in late July, 2013. Operating income for the Natural Gas and Pipeline segment, as a percentage of revenues, increased to 9% in 3Q '13 from 5.9% in 3Q '12. The increase is due primarily to continued successful execution on higher revenues, the combination of mainline activity from Nacap and, to a lesser extent, the start of the mainline projects that Jim referenced earlier, as well as the overall increase in segment revenues, which improved this segment's ability to cover fixed and overhead costs.","Similar to the Electric Power segment, backlog is higher both quarter-over-quarter and sequentially for the pipeline segment, with 12-month and total backlog increasing 34.8% and 8.2% compared to the end of the second quarter of 2013. These increases are primarily due to backlog associated with the Nacap acquisition. Also, as we've commented before, Keystone XL is not in any of the backlog figures presented for our pipeline segment.","Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment revenues were down $4.8 million or 10% to $44.4 million in 3Q '13 as compared to $49.2 million in 3Q '12, primarily due to lower levels of ancillary telecommunication service revenues. However, operating margin increased to approximately 31.8% in 3Q '13 as compared to 30.7% in 3Q '12, as a result of a larger proportion of Fiber Optic Licensing revenues earned during 3Q '13, which yield higher margins than the ancillary telecommunications and wireless infrastructure projects underway in 3Q '12.","When calculating operating margins by segment, we do not allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization expense to our segment. Therefore, the previous discussion about operating margins by segment excludes the effects of such expenses. Corporate and unallocated costs decreased $3.5 million in the third quarter of 2013 as compared to 3Q '12, primarily as a result of a $3.3-million reduction in amortization expense as previously acquired intangible assets became fully amortized, partially offset by amortization related to 2013 acquisitions.","EBITA for the third quarter of 2013 was $141.8 million or 8.6% of revenues compared to $132.8 million or 8.7% of revenues for the third quarter of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA was $185.8 million or 11.3% of revenues for the third quarter of 2013 compared to $171.4 million or 11.2% of revenues for the third quarter of 2012. The calculation of EBITA, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, all non-GAAP measures, and the definitions of these and day sales outstanding or DSOs, can be found in the Investors & Media section of our website at quantaservices.com.","Operating cash flow from continuing operations was approximately $83 million for the third quarter of 2013 as compared to cash used of $47 million for the third quarter of 2012. Capital expenditures net of proceeds from equipment sales were about $47 million, resulting in approximately $37 million in free cash flow for the third quarter of 2013. This compares to $112 million in negative free cash flow for the third quarter of 2012.","Also during the third quarter of 2013, we acquired J.W. Didado Electric and Nacap Australia in unrelated transactions, which included the use of approximately $118 million in net cash. The improvement in operating cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was primarily due to higher overall levels of operating activity and performance improvements, as well as decreased working capital requirements on certain projects during the 2013 period as compared to the 2012 period. Our DSOs were 82 days at September 30, 2013, compared to 93 days at June 30, 2013, and 91 days at September 30, 2012.","Contributing to the decrease in DSOs was the favorable impact of 9 days from reclassifying the change order receivable balance of $165 million on the Sunrise Powerlink project from current assets to other long-term assets. Since completion of the project, Power Electric, a Quanta subsidiary, and SDG&E have had ongoing meetings to review project scope, costs and performance criteria in order to reach resolution on the additional work performed and pricing of our change order.","As of early October, we were unsuccessful in agreeing on the amount owed to par, and as a result, have recently agreed to submit the change order to formal arbitration as per the contract. While the total change order being pursued by Quanta with respect to this matter is higher than the amount presented on Quanta's balance sheet, management has taken a more conservative position with respect to its financial statements and continues to believe that the company will be successful in collecting the amount recognized.","At September 30, 2013, we had about $226 million in letters of credit outstanding, primarily to secure our insurance program, and we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. In addition, at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $309 million in cash, with approximately $184 million of the balance related to foreign operations. Considering our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility, we had nearly $783 million in total liquidity as of September 30, 2013.","As Jim previously commented, subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we completed 2 additional acquisitions in our pipeline segment for an aggregate combined consideration of approximately $181 million, of which approximately $125 million was paid with cash on hand and short-term borrowings under the credit facility.","In consideration of Quanta's acquisition strategy and continued approach to leveraging our balance sheet capacity on larger-scale infrastructure projects, we also amended our revolving credit facility yesterday to increase our availability under the facility to $1.325 billion and extended the maturity date to October 30, 2018.","Concerning our outlook for 2013. We expect revenues for the fourth quarter of 2013 to range between $1.65 billion and $1.75 billion, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be $0.39 to $0.41 on a GAAP basis. Included in our estimate of GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2013 is a net tax benefit of approximately $0.02 per share associated with the release of certain income tax contingencies due to the expiration of certain statute of limitation periods during the fourth quarter.","In addition, the company's outlook for the fourth quarter of 2013 continues to reflect nominal emergency restoration service revenues as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, which included record emergency restoration service revenues of $130 million. These estimates compare to revenues of $1.67 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.48 in the third quarter of 2012, which also included a $2.7 million benefit from the release of income tax contingencies impacting the prior year fourth quarter by $0.01 per diluted share. Our GAAP EPS forecast for the fourth quarter of 2013 includes an estimate of $7.6 million for noncash compensation expenses and $9.5 million for amortization expense. Excluding these expenses and the impact of income tax contingency releases, our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2013 are expected to be $0.42 to $0.44, and compared to our non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.51 in the fourth quarter of 2012. This non-GAAP measure is estimated on a basis similar to the calculations of historical adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations presented in our release.","We are currently forecasting net income attributable to noncontrolling interests to be approximately $4 million to $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. And for additional guidance, we are currently projecting our GAAP tax rate to be around 33% for the fourth quarter and our diluted share count to be about 217 million shares. We expect CapEx for all of 2013 to be approximately $260 million to $270 million, which includes CapEx for our Fiber Licensing and Other segment of about $45 million to $50 million, as well as an increase associated with the $24 million in vessels Jim previously discussed. This compares to CapEx from continuing operations for 2012 of about $209 million.","This concludes our formal presentation, and we'll now open the line for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from William Bremer from Maxim Group.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Can we talk a little bit on pricing, what's currently in your backlog now for each segment? Has that been improving sequentially or has it been improving year-over-year? Just give a little sense on the pricing power of the end markets that you are working on now.","Derrick A. Jensen","Sure, Bill. This is Derrick. Relative to pricing, we like to look at things as though we have the same level of pricing discipline throughout. So what I would say is, the margins we're seeing in backlog today are comparable to the margins that you've seen in both the Electric Power and in the pipeline segment.","William D. Bremer - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. Now let's go into international. Can we get an update on Australia? This something a little bit out of -- a little bit on the newer side in terms of your business mix, what you're seeing there? And then also, touch base on the offshore opportunity for you, given -- and give us a sense of what is the current capacity that you could do there. And I'm sure you'll be investing with that continuously as projects come up, but a little more granularity would be appreciated.","James F. O'Neil","Okay. First Australia, Bill. We're seeing similar drivers that we're seeing in the U.S., probably more so than in the U.S. and in Canada. There's significant opportunity to build out the pipeline infrastructure and certainly, we're at or ahead of schedule on where we expected to be when we made the acquisitions. So things are moving along nicely there. As far as the offshore environment, what we're trying to do is replicate the services that we're performing on land today, offshore. The main reason we're doing that is some of our primary customers that we're doing work for on their pipeline infrastructure and facilities on land have asked us to move into the offshore environment, because they don't feel they've got a viable solution with the amount of work that they've got going forward. We thought Performance Energy is an excellent company that has a strong management team and customer relations, that has differentiating services in the Gulf, primarily, today, and certain international markets. And we're going to leverage that with some of our technologies in-house, such as our integrity services, our engineering capabilities and program management to build that business. So we're very excited about that opportunity. Certainly, we're just getting our toe on the water on that and we'll just take it slowly and build opportunities with our customers as they present themselves.","Operator","Your next question comes from Will Gabrielski with Lazard Capital.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","As you look at the offshore market, I guess, can you comment, it sounds like your -- the part of the market that you want to address is fairly fragmented from your comments. Is that true? And how do you view this work? I mean, is it more MSA-style work and recurring opportunity or will it be discrete projects?","James F. O'Neil","A significant part of what PES does today is MSA work. It's recurring revenue with margins that are actually better than what we do in our core business today. And then there are other parts of that business that are adjacencies, that are highly fragmented, that lack technology and the sole-source solution that we see an opportunity to provide going forward.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then can you give us some color on up in the Canadian market? Just over the past 48 hours, a few big oil sands projects were sanctioned and there seems to be some pipelines associated with those. How that market is shaping up on the pipeline side for you and what the opportunity and competitive landscape looks like?","James F. O'Neil","Well, the competitive landscape there is less than the U.S. because they just don't have been the industry capacity in Canada that they do in the lower 48, and we anticipated that the Canadian pipeline market was going to be strong in the future years. That's one of the reasons that we've been bullish on our commentary. And the recent announcements that you've seen, I believe you're referring to the [indiscernible] announcement that just came out, is the primary -- one of the drivers. So we have a significant presence in Canada. I would -- I think that we're probably one of the leading, if not the leading, contractor in Canada and we're well-positioned to take advantage of those opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First question is in regards to, Jim, something you said about 2014. Typically, you guys are pretty conservative as you look out, but, I guess, backlog has grown fairly notably. So could you elaborate a bit on that double-digit quantitative commentary you gave on 2014? Is that in regard to what you think the revenues can do or whether that -- the earnings growth you see going into next year? And really what gives you the confidence you seem to be indicating in regards to that?","James F. O'Neil","Well, Tahira, we're seeing continued momentum in all of our -- all portions of our business. So we see top line growth. We see solid execution, which we've demonstrated over the past several years. Derrick talked about backlog and the margins in backlog. So everything is leading toward a growth year in all aspects of our bottom line and revenue growth and so forth. So we're excited about the opportunities going forward. That's why we've been bullish as early as we -- typically, we're not bullish until February about these comments. But we just see clear visibility going forward into '14 today than we have in the past this time going into any given year.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And the second question I had was really in regards to the acquisition commentary. Jim, it seems like you -- with the capacity, increasing your revolver, perhaps, and your commentary today, you're looking at doing something more sizable as you go into 2014. Could you give us -- make us a little more comfortable around the offshore opportunities you might be looking at there? We kind of have a mixed record in terms of some of the offshore names we cover because the pipeline from the subsea side sometimes tend to have most -- more risk associated with them. So anything on the risk side would be helpful.","James F. O'Neil","Well, let me be clear that the expansion of the credit facility is not associated with our movement to offshore. We made comments that we're going to take it slow and steady moving into the offshore environment. The expansion of the credit facility is for the typical reasons that we mentioned in the past. It's working capital in all segments of our business as we continue to grow, and it's capital for -- it's capital for acquisitions across all segments, as well as CapEx for growth. Those are the primary reasons, but it's not because we're trying to make some big play into oil and gas. That is not accurate, whatsoever, and I'm glad you asked that question because I'm sure there's some concerns about that out there. But that's not what the use of that credit facility is for.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify your comments on the margins in the bookings as book margins in pipeline and transmission segment. Did you say that they were consistent with third quarter margins? And I have a follow-up.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, this is Derrick. I mean, our margins that we're seeing in backlog or in the pipeline segment are consistent with the historical bidding margins that we have. So from your perspective of -- we target 9% to 12% from an operating perspective, which is inclusive of the costs that we incurred, but that's not necessarily representative of the margins that we're bidding. But the margins that you see from the bidding side of the equation and what's in backlog are consistent with our bidding approach historically.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then can you just talk a little bit about the transmission segment, how your book-to-bill would look like in the U.S. versus Canada. And also, your expectations for growth in 2014 with these markets?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, we continue to see opportunities in the U.S. and Canada comparable. I think that the growth rate in Canada has the ability to maybe be at slightly higher, simply because of the fact that it's growing on a smaller base. But the overall award activity we see between the U.S. and Canada is comparable. And then I think the second part of your question was really as it relates to '14. I think that we continue to see margins within the segment, specific Electric Power, in that 9% to 12% range that we continue to see throughout this year. You're seeing it in that performance of the 11% range. But as we look forward, I continue to say that, overall, a 9% to 12% is what we feel comfortable with.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of -- question one, on the quarter specifically. It was fairly a good quarter, the revenues were sort of at the low-end of what you guided. Can you just talk about was there anything different than your expectation? The Electric Power revenues struck me as a little light relative to what I thought, but I don't know if that was just me. And then, I guess, just my second question, again on the Electric Power margin, is there any reasons -- if we look at the margins in the first 9 months relative to where you were last year, I understand that there's less storm work. But as I look to sort of 2014, is there any reason, structurally, assuming that execution margins couldn't exceed or be more towards the higher end of the range or does like mix from distribution or smaller projects sort of bring the margin profile down [indiscernible]?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, Jamie, relative to the revenues, we did have some delay from the third quarter out associated with some of the transmission work up in Canada. It got a little bit later start than we anticipated. On a consolidated basis, we also had a little bit of delay on mainline. It came through -- those few projects started 3 to 4 weeks, a little bit later than what we had anticipated. So that's somewhat what pushed some of the revenues out and ended up putting us at the lower end of our revenue guidance. When thinking about '14 and the margins, as I said earlier, we continue to look at the 9% to 12%. Do I think that we could be at the higher end of that range throughout? From a normal perspective. I would say yes. But as you then, you talked about the growth of distribution. Distribution historically may have been at a little bit lower margins, but we continue to push ourselves into additional program management solutions and we're providing additional solutions to our customers, which is moving us up the value chain with them on the distribution side. So I think that we actually look at being able to push the margins and distribution up a little bit more than what we've seen historically.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jim, on the electric transmission bigger prospects you mentioned in the next few months, what's driving the confidence in those projects and timing? Have they gotten all the regulatory and permitting issues behind them?","James F. O'Neil","There are some projects that are in the final stages of trying to get permitting, and that's just -- we see that on every project, which could affect the timing, whether it gets awarded at the end of this year or in the first quarter of next year. But we do see 2 to 3 big projects that could be coming out here in the near term that -- we don't expect any major hurdles for those projects to be -- to move toward construction in '14.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on the pipeline, we're heading into what was the more traditional bidding season for the larger pipelines. Do you think that seasonality still holds for some of these bigger mainlines? And what's your base case for when we could see more of these mainlines get awarded?","James F. O'Neil","Well, we said it past that really this traditional bidding season that we historically have seen over the past, probably last year and this year, has really kind of gone away. It's kind of like a year-round process now that occurs. So there's really no bidding season. It's more having discussion with customers on these bigger programs and they could be lighted anytime during the year. So I wouldn't focus so much on the bidding season anymore. It's just not -- that dynamic just isn't occurring like it did, as it has historically.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","You've touched on this question a little bit already. But in the new business, in the offshore stuff, you kind of mentioned that it's MSA or maybe it's MSA-like. Does that mean it's not fixed pricing, it's done on a reimbursable basis? I just want to get a little bit better sense of what that risk profile looks like.","James F. O'Neil","Well, a lot of it is crews that are working on these production platforms, maintaining the engineering, the -- excuse me, the electrification and instrumentation and mechanical maintenance of the platform. So those folks are typically on some type of fixed-fee basis that -- on a 7-day on, 7-off basis or whatever. It's year-round work. It's MSA work that the margins are predictable, and they're certainly accretive to the company as we stand today.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then, you mentioned that in the -- I guess, in the electric segment that there's an MSA renewal. You don't see that every quarter, was that -- how much is the MSA backlog up sequentially? Maybe just give us a better sense of how much the MSA contribution helps -- was contributing to backlog this quarter.","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, I don't know that I'd say how much the MSA backlog was up per se, but I'll tell you that of the non-acquisition-related backlog, the remaining piece was probably roughly half of it was MSA work and most of that was in the beyond '12 period.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Mannes from Avondale.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick follow-up questions. First, you mentioned, Jim, in your prepared comments that you picked up the work from PPL. Without going into the details of this one, can you talk a little bit about maybe historical precedent for replacing other contractors, number one, and your positioning there? And then secondly, why would that occur in the first place, without specifically talking about this one?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I mean, it's difficult to get into that. I mean, we don't typically know the reasons why we get put on projects, because why other people might get replaced, I mean, it could be of various -- there could be various reasons for that. So I don't want to get into that, Dan. I mean, I -- what's exciting for us is that we were called in to help finish the project, and I believe we're doing very well on that project. We're ahead of schedule and we're excited to build that relationship with PPL and do more work for them going forward.","Daniel J. Mannes - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I just wanted to see if this was something that had happened in the past to other contractors and if this had been something you've been a beneficiary, not just this time, but maybe historically as well.","James F. O'Neil","Yes, we've -- I mean, we've replaced folks in the past on projects. And that's happened recently over the last several years because of the uptick in work. Labor is tight, the experienced leadership is tight and certainly some of these projects are becoming more difficult to complete, because there's aggressive time frames, it's more difficult terrain and more populated areas. So certainly, that's in our sweet spot from an execution standpoint, and we have replaced contractors over the last several years to finish projects.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from BB&T Capital.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Jim, I just wanted to ask you about -- you've talked about this in the past, your strategy in the pipeline business was to, I think, let others fill up on the early work, thinking that might be lower margin and then hold back some capacity for the later bidding. I just -- maybe you could reflect on kind of that strategy and where you are in that cycle?","James F. O'Neil","Yes. Adam, I don't know if that's exactly right. I mean, I think what we do is we're disciplined on pricing. And we've got several of our customers that we have more strategic relationships with that have more difficult builds in geographic areas where we typically excel, that have come out later than some of the other projects that came out earlier, a couple of -- again, earlier last year. So it's just the timing of when projects in certain geographical areas come up and when our key customers start their build programs more than waiting and holding capacity. Certainly, if there's a project for anyone that meets our margin profiles, we're going to take advantage of that opportunity.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then the second question, I wanted to ask about the -- Jim, your long-term outlook for offshore oil and gas. And, I guess, the question for me is how did the production costs offshore compare to the production cost onshore because -- and I don't know much about offshore, but you would just think that with all the development of onshore that offshore would be in secular decline. But maybe that's totally false, I really don't know.","James F. O'Neil","Well, let me just -- I want to say this again. We're not changing the profile of the company, okay? We're taking advantage of it in an adjacent market opportunity. So this isn't any big shift in strategy. It's a natural progression as we follow our customers into an opportunity that we believe we can execute on. When you look at the cost profile of this business, certainly, we believe that it's going to be more profitable than our core business today, and PES is a good example of that. Their margins are higher than our core business today, and their return on invested capital is higher than our margins today. I just want to make another comment that our primary service is not to be a marine support -- to provide customers with marine support activities. We see opportunities to provide solutions using technology and leverage our capabilities in-house today, and the marine vessels are just one aspect of supporting that, okay? And this is going to be very limited. I mean, we're not going to -- we're not going out to buy a bunch of vessels. We're here to support our customers in providing solutions that we don't believe are in place today, where our customers have comfort that there's a contractor that can provide those solutions today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Irwin with Wedbush Securities.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So in your outlook statement in your release, you lead off with an indication that there might be some regulatory or permitting risks in the fourth quarter. My understanding is previously you had looked to include a little of these potential risks in your guidance. Can you comment as far as whether or not anything's changed or if there's anything specific or unique that you're looking at in the fourth quarter and why would -- you would choose to put something in versus out, given that there might be a little bit of risk?","James F. O'Neil","Craig, we usually put that statement in our outlook every quarter. It's just the nature of -- our customers always have delays, projects never start on time. That's been like that for decades. And I don't see anything material or different. In fact, I think the environment is probably better today than it's been in quite some time. But we deal with delays all the time, and we have 2 or 3 of our the big transmission projects that are delayed right now. But people don't see that because we're on 16 major transmission projects. But delay is just something that we have to deal with, our customers have to deal with, and that's why it's in the outlook. And it will be in there in the future as well.","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. Great. And then the next question is really just a housekeeping question. Can you maybe share with us the mainline gas contribution in the quarter to bookings, revenue, backlog and where we stand on those numbers?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, we don't typically get into the specifics of the quantification of how much revenue came from that subsegment. And then in relation to backlog, I'm not certain I understood your question. I think you're just asking kind of how much of the incremental awards were mainline?","Craig E. Irwin - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes, that would directly answer it, yes.","Derrick A. Jensen","Okay. Well, as it stands right now, we also don't go through and really get into that level of detail on the specifics of kind of how mainline works, but our mainline is a component of that. But the reality is that the increase in backlog quarter-over-quarter is really all associated with Nacap within the pipeline group, and Nacap's revenues are historically mainline.","James F. O'Neil","Craig, TransCanada's not in backlog yet since that was announced subsequent to the quarter. So that will be added at the end of fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Rogers with Davidson.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Jim, could you talk a little bit about where you are on the pipeline capacity utilization? I mean, Derrick, you mentioned that you're pretty disciplined on pricing, but you've seen margins climb quite a bit. And is that just better utilization of what you have? And kind of where are we and how much excess capacity do you still have going into 2014?","James F. O'Neil","Well, I wouldn't say we have excess capacity right now. I mean, if you remember, we deployed our field leadership into the shales, and we've been very active in the shales doing gathering work. We probably generated over $1 billion in gathering revenues. And now the mainline work is beginning to accelerate and that does help, obviously, leverage some of the fixed costs we have on specialized pipeline, large-diameter pipeline handling equipment. So certainly, we have the ability to expand the spreads that we have to take advantage of opportunities. Strategically we've been planning this move in -- the increase in mainline activity while remaining in the shales, working for the customers we're working for today. So I wouldn't say that we've got excess capacity sitting around though. But certainly, we have an opportunity to take advantage of mainline price as it comes out over the next several years.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","But, Jim, if you can expand the spreads, not an exact number, but can you give us a sense of how much more work you can do with your capacity that you have now? I mean, I'm thinking about with TransCanada, hopefully, starts up and -- or that Keystone starts up.","James F. O'Neil","We have 9 to 12 spreads of capacity in the lower 48. And right now, we're on a couple of jobs. So certainly we can -- we've got the capacity to move -- to take on more opportunities in the lower 48. We've certainly got Australia, don't forget about that. I mean, Australia and Canada, there's certainly opportunities for growth there, too. We have capacity in those areas as well to take advantage of growth opportunities. So we're well positioned to take advantage of growth. We -- if there's an opportunity, being the largest specialized contractor in the industry, if there's a will there's a way. We'll be able to man those projects. We're not concerned right now about having limitations on pursuing additional work. We're not going to turn down work for our key customers or any project that has margins that meet our profile.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Rygiel with FBR.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Very excited about the backlog growth. Very excited about the pipeline margins being the highest in the last couple of years. And obviously, your commentary about bidding in the next quarter or so with regards to transmission and pipeline, all very bullish. You've answered most of the questions out there. But I did want to find out a little bit more color on the timing of the Sunrise arbitration. How should we think about that over the next 6 to 12 months?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, to the extent that we've moved it noncurrent, that's a direct statement that we're not anticipating any settlement within the next 12 months. I would think, in my own mind, that it's probably something in the 18- to 24-month time frame.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","That's perfect. And then, Jim, as it relates to sort of other acquisitions in the offshore arena, sort of in the near term, is that something we should be expecting or is this initial acquisition sort of an acquisition that you're going to use to sort of test the waters for the next year or 2 to see how much further you want to go?","James F. O'Neil","Yes, I think the latter is more accurate. I mean, PES is a nice platform to grow on. We may do some smaller selective-type acquisitions, but it's going to be more around technology-driven opportunities versus trying to build more mass. I don't see any big acquisitions in oil and gas in the near future.","Operator","Your next question comes with a line of Noelle Dilts with Stifel.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I actually wanted to start off with a few housekeeping questions. So first on the pipeline backlog, I know you talked about most of the growth coming from acquired operations. But could you just talk -- could you give us the exact number of -- amount of acquired backlog in both the next 12 months and total in pipeline?","Derrick A. Jensen","On the pipeline side, I would say that actually, it's -- if I'm not mistaken, I think most of the components of the 12-month and beyond are effectively from the acquisition of Nacap, probably in the $150 million range.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then when you look at the acquisition-related expenses that hit the quarter, did that fall into the electrical segment or did it fall into kind of unallocated corporate?","Derrick A. Jensen","It will fall in unallocated.","Operator","Your next question comes from Martin Malloy with Johnson Rice.","Martin W. Malloy - Johnson Rice & Company, L.L.C., Research Division","I was wondering, could you talk a little bit more on the -- and John Rogers asked this question, but a little bit more on the margin -- potential margin increases? You have more consistent work on the large-diameter pipeline. So I'm just trying to get a feel for, is there a couple of hundred basis points of upside potential there as you more fully utilize your equipment?","Derrick A. Jensen","Yes, in general, I mean, we look at the pipeline segment being able to get back into a 9% to 12% operating margin to the extent that more mainline work is provided. We reached the 9% level this quarter. We did have the contribution of the mainline work with Nacap and a little bit of mainline work here in the U.S. For us to get into that true 9% to 12% range on a recurring basis, we think that we're going to need to have some level of recurring mainline work. And I -- as we look at 2014 with some of the projections that Jim has talked about, we think that we have that opportunity.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Jim O'Neil for closing comments.","James F. O'Neil","Well, I'd like to thank all of you for participating in our third quarter 2013 conference call. And we appreciate your questions and ongoing interest in Quanta. Thank you. This concludes our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect your lines."]}}
