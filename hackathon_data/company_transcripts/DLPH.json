My name is Maria, and I'll be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Delphi's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Elena Doom, Delphi's Vice President of Investor Relations. Elena, you may begin your conference.","Elena Doom Rosman - Vice President of Investor Relations, Delphi Automotive Plc","Thank you, Maria. Good morning, and thank you for joining Delphi's fourth quarter earnings call. To follow along with today's presentation our slides can be found at Delphi.com under investor presentations. Please see slide two for a disclosure on our forward-looking statements, which do reflect Delphi's current view of future financial performance that can and may materially be different from our actual performance.","Joining us today is Kevin Clark, Delphi's CEO and President, and Mark Murphy, our CFO. As seen on slide three, Kevin will provide an operations update as well as an overview of the quarter, and then Mark will cover the financial results and the (sic) 2016 outlook in more detail.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Before Mark gets into our financial results I'd like to provide some color on the fourth quarter and 2015 full year as well as our outlook for 2016.","So let's begin with highlights on slide five. In summary, we had another good quarter, which was a really nice finish to a challenging year, in which we had very strong operating performance. Organic revenue growth was a robust 11% for the quarter and 6% for the full year, driven by just under 20% growth in China and roughly 13% growth in our Electrical Architecture and Electronics and Safety segments during the quarter.","Operating income totaled a record $503 million. That was above our guidance. However, operating margins lagged the prior year, primarily the result of the sequential whipsaw in China volumes. You probably recall that in response to the third quarter slowdown in China, we actually reduced head count by about 4,000 employees, and then, had to add back over 6,000 employees to meet the 40% sequential increase in volumes that we experienced in the fourth quarter.","While growth over market inflected in the quarter due to new launch activity, our outlook and our performance also reflected higher manufacturing costs as a result of this increased launch activity. So to put it in perspective, our operating team did an outstanding job executing on a record 75 major new program launches during the quarter and roughly 150 for the full year.","Lastly, Mark will take you through the details, but FX was a bigger impact to margins in the quarter, especially at our E&S segment. For the full year, operating income totaled almost $2 billion, representing a 60 basis point increase in operating margins. New business bookings exceeded 2014 levels, reaching a record $26 billion. And during the year we further optimized our manufacturing footprint, improving the flexibility of our cost structure.","And we generated $1.7 billion of cash flow from operations, and returned roughly $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends throughout the year. While at the same time making significant progress realigning our product portfolio through accretive acquisitions and investments that strengthen our competitive position, while exiting businesses that did not fit with our strategic and our financial objectives.","Slide six covers 2015 new business bookings in more detail, which as I mentioned totaled over $26 billion a year. We actually totaled over $4 billion for the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we had a number of important customer bookings as well as several conquest wins, including a GDi win with a major North American customer, Electrical Architecture awards with both Toyota and PSA, and the second wave multi-domain controller award with a European OE. We continue to be successful retaining replacement business with our existing customers, as reflected by our win rate on incumbent business of almost 90%.","The right side of the chart reflects the balanced geographic mix of our bookings, which will drive strong revenue growth over the next few years. And as important, the increased geographic and customer diversity ensures that we're not dependent on any one region, segment, or customer for growth. Given our focus on innovation, our portfolio of safe, green, and connected technology solutions and our track record of flawless execution, we continue to be an important strategic partner for our customers.","Slide seven outlines the view of the macro environment in 2016, beginning with our view of the tailwinds on the left. Regulatory trends and consumer demands continue to influence fuel economy, emissions, and vehicle safety standards, driving content for vehicle growth. As a result we see strong demand for our safe, green and connected technologies. We continue to expect solid growth in global vehicle production, primarily driven by strong growth in China, North America, and Western Europe.","As we sit here today, we do not expect foreign exchange rates to be as significant of a headwind as they were in 2015. Additionally, customer price-downs remain relatively stable.","However, we are anticipating some headwinds as detailed on the right side of the slide, including continued softness in vehicle production in both South America and in Eastern Europe and ongoing weakness in the global commercial vehicle market. As such, we will continue to aggressively optimize our cost structure. The flexibility of our cost structure and ability to execute in a challenging macro environment gives us confidence we'll continue to deliver on both our short as well as our long term financial commitments.","Turning to slide eight. Our strong bookings growth has led to a significant increase in major program launches, which in turn has accelerated revenue growth across each of our segments. To put this into perspective, major launches were up five-fold in the fourth quarter 2015 and two-fold for the four year \u2013 for the full year rather.","We expect that trend to continue as launches more than double in the first quarter of 2016. These major launches require additional manufacturing resources, as we trend to normalized run rates over the next couple quarters, which translates into a steady increase in margins over the course of the year. And we remain on track to deliver both 2016 and 2017 margin targets.","Turning to slide nine. Last month we made our 20th appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show, which seems to have a larger automotive presence each year. CES is a fantastic venue to showcase a few of our advanced technologies that will create a safer, more connected vehicle and ultimately drive significant revenue and earnings growth.","Our customers, our suppliers, and investors had the chance to travel the streets of [Las] Vegas in our two automated vehicles and experience first-hand some of our newer V [vehicle]-to-everything technologies. We returned from the show optimistic about the tremendous opportunities in active safety, automated driving, and vehicle connectivity, which is further validated by roughly $1.2 billion of active safety and $2 billion of Infotainment bookings during 2015.","And lastly, we're encouraged by the outlook for vehicle electrification. We're seeing accelerated quote activity and revenue growth driven by the success of the hybrid vehicle technologies like 48-volt, where content is more than four times our standard powertrain content.","Our capital allocation strategy, outlined on slide 10, remains an important lever to enhance shareholder value. We expect CapEx to total roughly $800 million in 2016, supporting new program launches in North America, Europe, and China; investments in information systems that increased efficiency and productivity; and supporting our ongoing footprint rotation to best cost countries.","We also believe an attractive dividend is another means of enhancing shareholder returns. As a reflection of our confidence in our underlying business, last month we increased our dividend 16% to $1.16 per share, representing a dividend yield of 1.9%.","And lastly, we remain focused on executing value enhancing portfolio modifications. As such we intend to deploy roughly half of our operating cash flow towards value accretive strategic acquisitions and investments as well as share repurchases.","On the M&A front we hope to acquire and make investments in businesses and technologies that further strengthen our competitive position, drive profitable growth, and are accretive to shareholder value.","To the extent we have excess cash we have a track record of returning it to shareholders via share repurchases, as evidenced by the roughly $1.2 billion of repurchases we did last year. Our current 2016 guidance assumes $400 million of share repurchases. However, we have the flexibility to take advantage of dislocations in the market to ramp up the pace of our repurchase activity.","As shown on slide 11 we believe we are well-positioned to deliver shareholder value in 2016. We will continue to optimize our cost structure by rotating our footprint to best cost countries, increase the flexibility of our workforce, optimize our regional service model, and further integrate the enterprise operating system to ensure flawless execution, both organically and through acquisitions, investing in safe, green, and connected technologies that address our customers' challenges and drive accelerated revenue growth, margin expansion, and enhanced returns.","I'll now turn the call over to Mark for a more detailed look at our financial results. Mark?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering our fourth quarter and full year 2015 performance and then discuss our 2016 guidance. Consistent with prior calls today's review of our actual and forecasted financials excludes restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations of Delphi. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP is included at the back of this presentation and the press release.","Let me start on slide 13 with a snapshot of our fourth quarter financial performance. As Kevin mentioned we were pleased with our quarter results, which reflected robust revenue growth and record earnings.","Revenue was up 3%, or 11% adjusted for currency and commodity effects. Operating income grew 1%, or 12% excluding currency. Operating margin was down 20 basis points from prior year, including a negative 40 basis point impact from foreign currency and the sales of the reception systems business. Additionally as Kevin mentioned, our margin rate for the quarter was impacted by the 40% sequential increase in China volumes, as well as higher manufacturing and engineering spend to support major new growth program launches across all segments.","Earnings per share grew 7%. However, adjusting for the effects of currency and commodities, EPS grew 19%.","Slide 14 provides greater detail on revenue in the quarter. As you can see currency and commodity effects were significant headwinds. However, organic growth was very strong at 11% and 8% over market, delivering on our growth outlook from early 2015. Regionally, Europe and Asia were exceptionally strong at 8 points and 10 points over market respectively. North America remained solid at 7% and 5 points over market. Though our business performed better than the market in South America, the underlying market there remains weak.","Turning to profit. Slide 15 walks the fourth quarter year-over-year change in operating income, highlighting the previously mentioned foreign exchange effects. The cost impact of the China volume recovery, as well as the investment to support new program launches, is captured in net performance. These items are expected to remain a headwind to our normal margin flow through in the first half of 2016. And accordingly were included in our previously communicated guidance. We are confident in our ability to expand overall margins by roughly 50 basis points in 2016.","Moving to slide 16. Let's look at the performance by segment. With sales growth and operating performance Electrical Architecture and Powertrain expanded margins 60 basis points year over year, despite additional costs resulting from the sharp recovery in China volumes.","As expected Electronics and Safety growth accelerated in the quarter on new program launches. The reported E&S margin rate of 10.4% was negatively impacted 260 basis points by unfavorable foreign exchange, the impact of the reception systems divestiture, and prior year nonrecurring items. When adjusted for these items E&S margins for the quarter were down 100 basis points on costs associated with support of new program launches.","As it relates to 2016 we expect continued strong growth from launches. Margins will expand over the course of the year with lower volume flow through in the first half.","Turning to slide 17. Increased earnings and lower share count drove EPS growth of 7% for the period. Excluding the effects of currency and commodities earnings per share grew 19%. Taxes came in as expected in the quarter at 14% on an adjusted basis; 16% adjusted for the year. On a year-over-year basis we were favorable by $0.01. However, that was offset by higher minority interest and versus our guidance, HellermannTyton financing, which we completed in the quarter.","Moving to slide 18, our full year results. We delivered record earnings in a challenging macro environment. In 2015 our results included unfavorable currency and commodity effects of $1.3 billion on revenue and $178 million on operating income. Organically, revenue was up 6% with our growth over market increasing through the year. Despite the previously mentioned headwinds, in 2015 we delivered more operating income, expanded margins 60 basis points, and grew earnings per share 16%, excluding currency and commodities.","Looking at the segments on slide 19. We delivered solid growth across all segments with growth over market strengthening through the year. Our overall margin expansion came in as expected. And going forward we project margin expansion to continue in line with our guidance and longer term financial targets.","Turning to 2016. Slide 20 highlights our full year guidance assumptions; no change from last month. We expect growth in global vehicle production of roughly 2%, reflecting 3% growth in North America, growth in Europe of 2%, a 4% increase in China, and a decline in South America of 10%. Our 2016 guidance maintains a $1.10\/\u20ac1 rate.","On slide 21 we reaffirm our 2016 guidance. Revenue is driven by accelerating organic growth and the full year effect of the HellermannTyton acquisition. Operating income growth for the year is 14% at the midpoint, expanding margins roughly 50 basis points. 2016 EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.80 to $6.10; no change from our prior outlook. We forecast first quarter revenue growth of 5% to 8% adjusted, with margins up slightly versus the prior year at midpoint. And we expect first quarter EPS in the range of $1.28 to $1.38, up 10% at the midpoint.","As Kevin mentioned our guidance assumes $400 million of share buybacks in the year. We intend to be opportunistic, while remaining committed to executing a balanced and disciplined capital allocation framework.","In summary Delphi overcame a number of headwinds and still delivered a great year. Our 2016 outlook is balanced and reflects our continued ability to adjust to changing market conditions.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some final thoughts before Q&A.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks, Mark. Now summarizing on slide 22. 2015 was a record year, as Mark just said. Once again, we demonstrated our ability to deliver on our commitments, even against the backdrop of a more challenging and volatile environment.","While capital markets are reflecting uncertainty in the underlying macro conditions, we aren't seeing anything today that would change our assessment of the market or the guidance that we provided last month. And while we're counting on a slight lift from global production in the year, if you look at the numbers, the bulk of our growth is driven by our planned new launches and increased content opportunities.","Now having said that, we continue to actively monitor the dynamics in the industry and plan our investments prudently. In the event conditions deteriorate, we've demonstrated several times the ability to respond quickly and surgically. The European slowdown in 2012 as an example, where revenues declined 6% and our operating margins actually increased by 50 basis points. And the China slowdown in the third quarter of 2015, where revenues actually declined $175 million, but we were able to offset that revenue shortfall with productivity initiatives. Those are a few of the examples. We continue to increase our flexibility and reduce our operating costs to ensure that we're positioned to mitigate unplanned headwinds.","Further, our strategy for value creation remains intact. We're supporting growth where we see opportunities and we remain disciplined in our allocation of capital. We continue to execute on the relevant breakthrough technologies that are driving incremental growth and margin expansion in 2016 and beyond, enabling us to outperform over the long term. You can expect to see and hear more about these innovations and our long term roadmap at our investor day coming up in London on April 13.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Had a couple questions. One is your overall performance in Q4 was in line, but the E&S margin specifically looked a little bit light in the fourth quarter. And you mentioned FX headwinds; I was hoping you can elaborate on that. And also how we should be thinking about the net performance in 2016? It sounded like it could be \u2013 get a little bit better over the course of the year.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, Mark, why don't I start at a high level and then I can turn it over to you, and you can go through the numbers in more detail. I think \u2013 first, Rod, I think to Mark's point with respect to the year-over-year at E&S, there's a lot of noise in the numbers that you need to make adjustments for, including the divestiture of our reception systems business, right? As well as foreign exchange, as well as a one-time item in the fourth quarter last year. And I think those amounts total roughly 250 to 260 basis points. The balance relates really to the launch activity \u2013 the significant ramp-up in launch activity that's reflected in the underlying growth rate at E&S.","As you roll out for the full year, both at E&S as well as for Delphi in total, you're going to continue to see some ongoing costs related to the China inefficiencies, as well as ramp costs into Q1, although at a much lower rate than what we have in the fourth quarter, and then continue to dissipate through Q2 and be largely gone in Q3 and Q4. So, as you look at margin expansion throughout the year both for Delphi as well as E&S, you'll see a gradual margin expansion on a sequential basis.","As it relates to the FX exposure, Mark, do you want to talk about that?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Rod. We did have in the quarter, particularly around euro, renminbi, we had some transactional exposure, some balance sheet re-vals, which contributed several million beyond the normal operating margin flow-through rate we see in the business on FX.","And then as Kevin mentioned, there's some elevated costs around launches, which we expect to have peaked in the fourth quarter, remain elevated in the first and then begin to trail off through 2016 as that business returns to more normal margins.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just secondly, I was hoping you can give us a couple of the elements of the bridge just to \u2013 not for E&S specifically \u2013 but for the overall company as we look out at Q1. Does the acquisition revenue roll through at something like a 15% margin? And how should we be thinking about the FX\/commodities performance as we look at Q1?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. On the acquisition \u2013 so acquisition revenues for the quarter \u2013 it's $800 million for the full year. It's about...","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","$190 million.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","$190 million for the quarter at an OI rate that's consistent with our current corporate OI rate. You need to offset that to some extent, Rod, with the divestiture of the reception systems business. So that reduces the number by about $20 million or $25 million in the quarter and has a small effect on OI.","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So I think, Rod, we \u2013 just walking from the $472 million last year \u2013 we've got volume\/price of about $30 million flowing through at normal rates. I'm talking OI.","As Kevin mentioned we've got the HellermannTyton revenue flowing through, but offset by some divestments and stranded costs there. Little bit lower flow-through than it will on a run rate basis. We have very little FX effect in the first quarter; low, mid-single digits impact. Unfavorable, but mid-single digits.","And then, we have what we talked about, some of these launch costs in China, inefficiencies on production persisting, but down from the fourth quarter. So we ran \u2013 we'll be down about $20 million lower versus what we ran in the fourth on that bucket of costs. Net performance will be close to $0.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So just to clarify what you just \u2013 the way you bridged it, it's like $18 million to $48 million of year-over-year EBIT growth, you said 30% incremental on the organic of around $300 million. So that gives you about $90 million, pricing consistent, net organic growth minus pricing might be around $20 million positive. The acquisition adds $25 million. And then did you say that the performance and commodities is kind of a push?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Commodities and FX is roughly mid-single digits. Price is roughly in line with last year. I'm doing the walk your way at $76 million. Volume at 30% flow through. And then the net performance numbers we talked about.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a first question. I mean obviously leverage stepped up a little bit with the HT acquisition as expected. It looks like it was about 1.6 times on a gross basis on trailing EBITDA. For both you, Kevin and Mark, I mean if you think of that number, I mean it was a step up. But it's certainly not anything that's alarming.","Would you be willing to maybe take that up somewhat significantly to get a lot more aggressive on share buybacks, just given where the stock is right now? I'm just trying to understand, given opportunities to acquire your own shares or maybe other strategic acquisitions, how far you might push that leverage ratio?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Listen, I don't \u2013 I couldn't give you an exact number with respect to the leverage ratio. As we've told you over the \u2013 it's our objective to remain an investment grade company.","Having said that when you look at where our balance sheet is, you look at the cash flow generation forecast for 2016, there certainly is an opportunity to be more aggressive on a \u2013 from a share repurchase standpoint. And as I said in my prepared comments, to the extent there's dislocation in value we're going to certainly accelerate share repurchases in a meaningful way.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. Then just a second question. Could you just remind us what your commercial vehicle exposure is? It sounds like you're highlighting that as a risk. But I think it's relatively small in the grand scheme of the company.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. It's about 10% of total revenues. And our outlook for the commercial vehicle market this year is flat to down a point or 2 points, depending on markets.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And profitability would be roughly close to the corporate average? Or a little bit above?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Yeah. No, profitability is in line with the corporate average.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just lastly, if you could just talk about sort of bids that are in process right now as we look at the potential for new business bookings in 2016? And how you think that may shape up? Is there sort of increased activity? Or is there a little bit of leveling out?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No. The actual \u2013 the pool of opportunities is actually higher. So the amount of activity that remains out there is actually higher than what it was in 2015, which is certainly a positive sign. So we would expect from a booking standpoint to come in roughly in line with what we booked in 2015 from a total new business bookings standpoint.","The big opportunities tend to be around, as you can guess, active safety. We're seeing a big ramp-up in demand \u2013 off of a small number obviously \u2013 on vehicle electrification, including things like 48-volt, as well as a fair amount of activity on our traditional powertrain products like GDi, Gas Direct Injection. So very good. Great deal of opportunity out there.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning. I wanted to talk a bit about the Powertrain unit. A couple questions. The organic growth of 4% in 4Q. Was this expected? Was there commercial vehicle headwinds there?","Secondly, what's the bridge to get to 8% growth in 2016? Does it have to do with take rates? Does it have to do with program launches?","And just thirdly, how are the dialogues vis-\u00e0-vis timing of customer programs going? Given both where oil prices are and the sort of views about the cycle, which I know are more intense on Wall Street than perhaps in OEM headquarters.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Well let's start with your last question first. We've seen no shifting in schedules from a Powertrain quite frankly or any of our other businesses. We've seen absolutely none.","With respect to the growth rate of the Powertrain business. In the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of this year Powertrain segment growth will be a bit slower, primarily the result of a challenging comp in our aftermarket business. So if you remember, Brian, last year we launched a major program with a U.S. independent aftermarket retailer that had very strong revenue. So that affects the year-over-year comp in the Powertrain segment. So that's one.","Two, what you will see is consistent in reality with the balance of our businesses. Based on the timing of the ramp-up of all these launches, growth is going to be stronger in the second half of the calendar year than it is in the first half of the calendar year, consistent with the margin explanation that Mark talked about. So we're still very optimistic about the Powertrain segment.","The other thing to underscore though is \u2013 we've talked about it in the past, and I mentioned it again in my comments. We're starting to see more demand, more of a ramp-up in vehicle electrification, including things like 48-volt. Those are very good for us. So 48-volt hybrid content is four times to five times the content that we have on a traditional car. Full EV is seven times the content. 48-volt is an area that \u2013 quite frankly a product that we'll be talking more with folks like yourself about at our investor conference in April. But the great thing about it is it's 70% of the benefit at 30% of the cost for the OEs. So we think it's a great value proposition.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And also on Powertrain, just to finish up. Margins expanded in the quarter even though revenue ticked \u2013 on a headline basis was down, on an adjusted basis was the slowest of your three segments. Is that because of the lack of launch activity? And I guess in general how should we be thinking about the cadence of margin in that segment?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well launch \u2013 I mean launch activity was a little slower. But there's still \u2013 relative to the other businesses I think it's really the benefit of \u2013 as you recall we've done a fair amount of footprint rotation in our Powertrain business. And it's the benefit related to that footprint rotation.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just one final strategic Powertrain question. Are you getting more software work around Powertrain? Just given sort of what went on with a major European manufacturer and their diesel issues, which centered around software? Is there any kind of desire of OEMs to have a second set of eyes on the software, even if they could do it themselves internally?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. That's an interesting question. I don't think we've seen it as a result of that. However, as you know there's more electrification. There's more software going into the Powertrain. So that is certainly an overall trend that we're seeing. I don't believe it's a result of the event that you're talking about.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pat Archambault of Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. This is actually Dave Tamberrino on for Pat. Our first question really relates to price downs. Just looking at the last four quarters, we've seen them accelerate from the 1.5% range to really exiting the year at 2%. One, what's driving that? And secondly as we get a little bit longer here in the cycle at least in North America, do you anticipate further pressure here?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. That's a good question. We get asked it a lot. We've always said price downs will be in the range of 1.5% to 2%. Last year I think we ended the year at 1.4%. This year we're at about 1.8%.","The primary driver of that quite frankly is faster growth in the E&S business, where price downs tend to be 2% to 3%, versus our Powertrain business and E\/EA businesses that have lower price downs.","With respect to added pricing pressure our response is, our customers always challenge us for price downs. It goes on when times are good. It goes on when times aren't quite as good. So we would tell you we haven't really noticed the environment changing.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And then we're about six months removed now from the onset from the VW emissions scandal. Just thinking about your business within Europe, have you seen any shift really in production? Or any of the take rates that are going on within the region?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No. No, nothing out of the ordinary. No. Have not seen any change.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then lastly in the U.S. Looking at January numbers at least for a couple of the OEMs, it looks like there was some excess inventory exiting January. We're really wondering if you've seen any changes in your OEM partners in terms of what production schedules look like in the short term?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No. I'm \u2013 listen we've \u2013 again we understand the concern that people in the investment community have with respect to where we are in the cycle and what production schedules look like. We see none. I mean we've seen absolutely no change in production schedules from when we gave guidance originally a month ago, as well as what our outlook was in the fourth quarter of last year as it relates to 2016. So we've seen no change.","I think if you go back and you track SAAR in retail sales, January does tend to be a lower month relative to the other months in the year.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thank you very much, guys.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks a lot for taking my question.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Ryan.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Just looking at the 1Q margin guidance, 12.3% to 12.7% [operating margin]. Can you quantify at all what the impact is in dollars or in margin from the China production inefficiencies? Just to help us kind of better gauge the underlying rate. And then on the efficiencies can you remind us of the cadence of them? And whether you expect any sort of lingering impact as late as 2Q, for example?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Listen, the China piece in Q4 was roughly call it $20 million \u2013 $15 million to $20 million. Q1 we expect it to basically decline to roughly $5 million. So there will be a lingering effect in Q1, and then it'll fall away in Q2.","However, given launch activity there'll still be some of that incremental launch cost carry-on from Q4 into Q1. Call it another \u2013 I don't know \u2013 $25 million roughly of launch costs in Q1 relative to a higher number. Call it roughly $60 million in Q4.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then just last question is a macro one. I see on slide 20 that your industry assumption for China is plus 4% in 2016. That's reasonable; of course, I don't think anybody really knows, right? So, but I see that IHS is using plus 6%. So I'm just curious about your decision to forecast less than them? Whether that's due to something that you're seeing on the ground over there? Or is there a different view as to when the current strength in China pulls from? Does it pull from second half 2016 instead of 2017 after the incentives expire, as their forecast seems to imply? I just thought to ask your thoughts on the market since you have...","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sure.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...a bigger exposure and you've been there longer than most.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sure. No. Listen, we \u2013 I mean the first thing \u2013 when you look at HIS, I think you need to make sure when we talk about market assumptions we include commercial vehicle. So that does have an effect. And given the fact that we're flat to slightly down in commercial vehicle versus past car growth, that will have some effect.","I think in addition to that there may be a little bit of conservatism built into our numbers. We still remain optimistic about the China market. Q4 growth was very strong; was quite frankly, as we said before, a bit of a surprise. Our outlook for the balance of the year is solid growth. And if the market ends up being stronger I think that is an upside to our overall outlook for the business.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, everybody.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Adam.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just one question. Hi. It's on the startup costs. And the question is kind of, is it unreasonable to assume that given the huge growth in very different technologies and sometimes untested technologies \u2013 or let's say uncommercialized, let's say \u2013 in the E&S business that you're going to see over the next couple years, that some of the startup costs and launch costs, I should call them, are just regularly recurring for a while and can reasonably be assumed to weigh down on margins? And I ask that because I think everyone on the \u2013 at least on the sell side I've seen \u2013 has margins in E&S just going up inexorably each year. And I'm just wondering if there's like a scenario where the startup costs are \u2013 we should have them running recurring basically.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. I...","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Or if not larger. Yeah.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. No, listen. I \u2013 relative to where we are today and the amount of launch activity at E&S \u2013 I'd say no. I think significant amount of launch activity, Adam, in Q4 or Q1 and ramping down in Q2 at E&S. So I think you have some normalization.","I think long term margins for E&S, from my perspective, remain in line with what our longer term outlook was. And I think the question is \u2013 the question I would ask myself is \u2013 how aggressive in terms of investment in new technologies do we \u2013 how aggressive do we want to be? How aggressive do we want to be in pursuit of those technologies as well as that business? And I think that's something that we have the ability to calibrate on or off. And to the extent we decide to be more aggressive from an investment standpoint, it's something that makes sense financially, and we're able to communicate to folks like yourself.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And you'd agree with the opportunity.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, Kevin. Can I just ask a follow-up, please?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sure.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","We're seeing a lot of, say, nontraditional players getting involved in the software part of the car, whether it's safety or even in Powertrain. I couldn't help but notice the Chevy Volt, just it seems like LG Corp. like basically made two-thirds of the purchase bill of materials of that car. I'm sure you saw that too. Is that factoring into your longer term views of where the margins of say E&S or Powertrain could be? Is the pace of let's say nontraditional crowding progressing as you'd expect? Or is that something that \u2013 is that a variable, a vector to think about?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. No, it's \u2013 listen, it's something that we always think about. To date, it's not as direct a competition in terms of space or places that we compete. So it hasn't had an effect. And it's something we watch closely. I mean the Chevy Volt is a great example. I mean, that's a car where we have close to $400 of content. So we have a pretty good position from a vehicle standpoint. But it's something we monitor very closely.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak of RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Actually just wanted to follow up on Adam's line of questioning a little bit. So, obviously there will always be launch costs. It sounds like they'll be a little bit lower. I guess, though, what I was wondering is how \u2013 I mean it seems like there's also going to be a period of time when you take on this new business until it gets to a right normal run rate of profitability to wring out the most \u2013 most of the efficiencies you can. So, as we get all this new business coming on, can you give us some indication as how long it takes to actually get to the proper run rate margin for the new business versus the core or the base business if you will?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. No, two to three quarters. And I \u2013 it depends what the product is. But two to three quarters, Joe. Not any longer than three quarters.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then within E&S \u2013 sorry if I missed this, but is \u2013 any breakdown between Infotainment or active safety? Or what really sort of drove that big backlog launch in the quarter?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","What drove the big \u2013 it's really \u2013 it's both. So, active safety growth in the fourth quarter for Delphi was 66%. For a full year, we're well north of 50%. And we're launching new Infotainment programs where our growth in Infotainment in 2016 is going to be roughly 25%. So, those are two very active product lines.","And then the last is, again, I mentioned vehicle electrification. Our revenue growth in vehicle electrification product line is going to be well north of 50% in 2016. So, those are all the big drivers at E&S.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. One more housekeeping. And maybe I'm wrong here, but I think you still didn't get the proceeds from the Thermal China JV. Is that accurate? And when do you expect to get that?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. We'd expect second quarter of this year. But you're correct.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","We have not, but we expect it to actually receive them in the second quarter.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And that's roughly $200 million or so?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No. No. It's about $90 million.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","$90 million? Okay.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Remember, we own half of it. So your $200 million is probably the view on the total value.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of David Leiker of Baird.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. This is Joe Vruwink in for David.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey, Joe.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","If I consider the quarterly cadence of what might be likely in China from a production standpoint, it would seem that growth rates probably decelerate as the year goes on. And we might even hit a negative comp by Q4. I'm just wondering does your guidance then imply that you're going to see net-net negative performance out of China maybe by Q4 in anticipation of needing to make either head count changes or line rate reductions for the production decline?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. I don't \u2013 I think you look at it mathematically it'd be much slower growth to a slight decline in Q4 as you look at the number. I don't think it'd be a significant head count reduction if we had to do it, nor would it be costly. I mean that's a region where we can change up head count very, very quickly.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I guess the question is given what you saw in \u2013 with the layoffs happening during summer, needing to build staff back up Q3, and then incurring these costs Q4 and Q1, is there any lessons learned? Where you might've \u2013 you could've done something different? Where as we get into the back half and things might be softening or slowing, maybe the incrementals or the decrementals are better this time around?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Well listen. I think once we normalize I think the incrementals would be the same, maybe a bit better. Listen, I would \u2013 we obviously follow the markets very, very closely. The China market, the decline happened very rapidly.","I think our view as a management team here is we'd rather be in front of the cost reductions versus behind it. So I think it would be fair to ask the question would you act as aggressively in hindsight without knowing that schedules were going to rebound as much as they had in the fourth quarter? Would you react as quickly and aggressively? And I think we'd tell you we would, because we'd rather be in front of a slowdown versus behind it.","And that's a part of the cultural DNA here \u2013 we have here. We talk a lot about growth. We talk a lot about opportunities from an innovation and technology standpoint. At the same time over the last two years we've closed close to 15 manufacturing facilities globally. So we're always focused on how do we manage the business, how do we increase the flexibility of the cost structure under the realization that we operate in a cyclical industry.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lim of Wells Fargo Securities.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","David.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Several questions here. You added back more employees than you laid off in China if I heard you correctly. Is that due to...","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is that more due to surge production \u2013 a surge in production? Or are you thinking that there's just maybe an incrementally better outlook for you guys in 2016 in China than what you guided to?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No. It's what we needed to deal with to deal with the production. Right?","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","In reality you're \u2013 not only was the production ramp-up significant. But it's you have a new employee who is going to be less efficient or productive than a historical employee. Therefore you need more of them.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. And then on the restructuring side, I saw an uptick in Powertrain. Can you give us a little bit more color there? Was it more in Asia, Europe? And in theory wouldn't that yield stronger margins in the coming quarters or the flow through from the restructuring activity?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Yeah. It would be primarily in Europe.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And finally, and a little bit more of a housekeeping item. How should we think about operating income and revenue cadence from Q versus \u2013 one half versus the second half? Thank you.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well revenue growth will be a couple points higher second half versus first half. And then margin expansion with the exception of \u2013 you'll see sequential increase in margin expansion with the exception of the third quarter, which as you know, David, with the shutdowns in Europe and North America tends to be the lowest margin quarter.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner of CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Morning, Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","I wanted to ask you a little more detail on the content opportunity for you guys on the vehicle electrification. So you have been talking about really impressive numbers, four times, five times on the 48-volt and up to seven times on electrical vehicles. Can you maybe unpack a little bit what goes into these calculations? Is that pure electrical content increase? Or does that net out also what you would potentially lose in terms of Powertrain \u2013 traditional Powertrain content?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","And does that assume any level of autonomous driving in there?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","It doesn't assume anything on autonomous driving. And it is a net number. So to the extent we're losing content on a fully electric vehicle, it doesn't include the content of an internal combustion engine. But it's things like an electrical architecture, it's the wiring and connectors associated with EVs or hybrids. At E&S it's inverters, converters, hybrid control units, it's battery pack, and controllers, not the battery. It's chargers. Powertrain, it's the supervisory controller. So it really affects each one of our segments.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","So ultimately in the fully electrified world you would have massive segments in E&S and E\/EA.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","And then a strong \u2013 much more than offsetting a strong segment in Powertrain.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. I think that's a \u2013 depending on the size of the engine, if it's a hybrid. But I think in a simplistic and a basic way to look at it, you're absolutely right. Very good growth at E&S and E\/EA with potentially lower growth or a decline in Powertrain revenue.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And then one question on China. So we've been seeing through this past year a bit of a mix shift towards smaller engines, largely due to the tax cut on those engines. But also I think the growth coming from lower tiered cities and maybe the lower end of the market. Is that an opportunity for you, because essentially you could sort of like sell your GDis on these smaller engines? Or is that a negative mix implication, because we're talking about customers that may be a little bit more price sensitive? Or segments of the market that are more price sensitive?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No. We would say it's an opportunity. At the end of the day it's an opportunity.","So first to give you a perspective. 80% of our revenue in China is on platforms where the vehicles have a 1.6-liter engine or less. So just to put that in perspective. With respect to the Powertrain technology needed to hit the CO2 targets in China, they always need things like GDi. Those are important aspects to have them hit their fuel economy standards. So they're areas of opportunity for us. They're definitely areas of opportunity.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thank you.","Kevin P.

Deem - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Does your current share price impact your view of M&A? And by that I mean are you more inclined to take advantage of the market dislocation we're seeing? Or is M&A the more attractive alternative, based on the visibility you have in your current pipeline? And are any deals maybe in advanced negotiations that might impact your share repurchase rate near term?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Nothing to announce today. Listen, I \u2013 at the end of the day we always try to be active and look what's out there from a technology and M&A opportunity. We have a pipeline of opportunities that we continue to evaluate.","But we always look at M&A from a strategic and financial return standpoint. And we look at it through the lens of where the current value of our stock is. And yeah. The reality is it does affect our view. Right? It can't help but affect our view.","But to the extent we could find a very compelling M&A transaction with really great synergies that we looked at. And relative to share repurchase it looked more attractive to driving long term shareholder value, that's something that we would certainly do. To the extent there isn't something out there like that, we would certainly ramp up the pace of our share repurchase activity.","Anthony J. Deem - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Then just one extra question from me please. Within your 2016 guidance can you share any outlook you have for the light duty diesel mix? You mentioned there's nothing really out of the ordinary you're seeing. So maybe I should assume your outlook is similar to before? Maybe diesel trending a shade below production rate?","And then just curious to get your latest thoughts on CO2 standards, the role of diesel? And if anything has changed in your mind over the medium to long term to hit fuel economy standards? Thank you.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Yeah. So our view, light duty diesel \u2013 light duty diesel \u2013 our view on light duty diesel penetration rates hasn't changed. And it's basically there'll be some growth, but albeit slow. And penetration rates will actually decline in Western Europe.","Having said that based on our discussions with all our OEs, all of them view diesel as absolutely critical to meeting the CO2 regulations that are out there.

Thanks for joining us. Before Joe gets into our financial results, I'd like to provide some context around the second quarter, as well as our outlook for the full year. Beginning with the second quarter highlights on slide five, to summarize we had a solid quarter delivering accelerated revenue and earnings growth. Our revenues increased 7% driven by strong double-digit growth in our Electronics and Safety segment, which had over 40% growth in active safety revenues, and high single-digit growth in Electrical Architecture. Powertrain revenues, however, were weaker than expected principally due to lower heavy duty and light duty diesel volumes, and we also experienced increased demand volatility, with certain key local customers across our segments impacting our growth in the China market, which we currently believe will continue into the second half of the year.","Operating income increased to $577 million and margins expanded to 13.7%, driven by both volume growth and continued cost structure optimization. These increases were partially offset by our continued investment in engineering and information systems to fund growth initiatives, as well as some recent manufacturing inefficiencies in our Electrical Architecture segment that we're working through. Joe's going to provide more color on these in a few minutes. Earnings per share increased 19% to $1.59 a share and despite some macro headwinds, we're raising the midpoint of our full-year EPS outlook $0.05 to between $5.95 and $6.05 per share.","As Joe will discuss in detail later, we're reflecting the changing macro environment and updated customer schedules in our revised outlook for sales and operating income in the back half of the year. We remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, investing in both organic and inorganic growth, and at the same time, we returned $144 million of cash to shareholders during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to roughly $600 million. We also posted strong second quarter bookings of $6.5 billion for a total of $13 billion year-to-date reflecting awards from both our traditional OEMs as well as newer non-traditional customers. In summary, we continue to leverage our business model and remain very focused on execution.","Slide six highlights a few of the assumptions impacting our current outlook. Starting with the positives on the left, regulatory trends and consumer demands continue to influence fuel economy, CO2 emissions and vehicle safety standards, driving content per vehicle growth.","We continue to experience very strong demand for our active safety, infotainment, gas direct injection, variable valve train and power electronic product lines, and increased demand for our active safety products has translated into increased interest in our automated driving solutions. As several cities such as Singapore, Boston, Columbus and others are investing in automated driving pilots, all in support of the future mobility-on-demand, presenting us with even more opportunities for future profitable growth.","The right side of the chart reflects our current view on the macros, including further currency and commodity headwinds, primarily from the recent devaluation of the sterling and Chinese RMB, increased weakness in the global commercial vehicle market, driven by double digit declines in North America more than offsetting growth in the European and Asian markets, and slowing global vehicle production in the second half of the year, particularly in China, as well as weaker light duty diesel volumes in both Europe and the emerging markets.","In summary, although the macro environment appears to be increasingly challenged, we're confident in our updated outlook for the balance of the year. Continued strong business bookings are reflecting on slide seven, which as I mentioned, totaled approximately $13 billion through the second quarter. We had a number of important customer bookings as well as several new platform wins in the quarter, including large conquest wins for Electrical Architecture with GM in North America, and with Daimler in Europe, Powertrain wins including valve trains programs with both Hyundai and General Motors and engine control module conquest win with VW and the GDI win with Changan in China and the key power electronics wins for Electronics and Safety with Geely in China as well as an active safety win with Audi.","On the right side of the chart, you'll see a sampling of the customer diversity in our year-to-date bookings ensuring that we're not dependent on any one customer or any one region or business segment for growth. Turning to slide eight. As we've discussed previously, our customers are increasingly seeing the need for further electrification of the powertrain to close regulatory gaps on CO2 emissions and fuel economy. 48-volt mild hybrids deliver roughly a 70% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to full hybrids at about 30% of the cost. Given our strength in Electrical Architecture and power electronics, Delphi has competitive advantage in the intelligent electrification of the vehicle.","The increased interest from customers is further validated by the stronger volume projections from industry experts, who are now forecasting 48-volt mild hybrids making up 15% of vehicle production by 2025. That's up from just 10% six months ago. Now, we've been awarded a third customer program since our last update bringing total 48-volt bookings to roughly $200 million, with the first two programs launching with European OEMs in late 2017. In addition, we're presently engaged in discussions with four additional major OEMs on potential development programs in this exciting space.","On slide nine are just a few examples of some of our 2016 major program launches. Electronics and Safety revenues are benefiting from infotainment launches on the VW MQV platform, the Cadillac XT5, and the Chrysler Pacifica and active safety launches on the Renault Scenic and BMW 5 series, as well as power electronics launches on a number of these platforms including the Volvo S90. Revenue growth in our Electrical Architecture segment is partially driven by program launches on the Daimler E class, Chrysler Pacifica and the Volvo S90, and Powertrain revenues are benefiting from the launch of the Ecotec small engine on Chevrolet's Malibu, and Volkswagen's 1.4 and 1.6 liter engine platforms.","Turning to slide 10. Over the last few years there's been a lot of focus on active safety and the technologies that support it. As you've heard us say previously, active safety technologies are the building blocks that will ultimately support autonomous vehicles, saving thousands of lives each year, so that's why active safety's the fastest growing sector in automotive and certainly for Delphi. Customers want it and regulators see the benefit of it. During the first half of 2016, we booked $700 million in active safety awards, with wins across each geographic region and we're on track to achieve well over $1 billion in active safety bookings for the fourth straight year in a row.","Now with almost 80% of the safety benefits of Level 4 automation coming for just 20% of the cost at Level 2 automation, we see the near-term demand for active safety technologies only growing. As a result, we expect our active safety revenues to increase roughly 50% annually over the next few years.","And on slide 11, as a result of our industry-leading portfolio of active safety and automated driving solutions, we were recently selected by Singapore to develop and implement an end-to-end ecosystem for an urban point-to-point on-demand autonomous vehicle service. Delphi will provide a fleet of fully autonomous vehicles, leveraging our proven automated driving platform, including advanced sensors, software and electrical distribution. And we will develop a cloud-based mobility-on-demand software suite, opening up new potential autonomous markets for Delphi customers and enabling faster commercialization opportunities. Other pilots are planned for cities in North America and Europe and we expect to make those announcements later this year.","With that, I'll hand it over to Joe to cover the financials in more detail. Joe?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will start by covering our second quarter performance and then discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Let's begin on slide 13 with a snapshot of our second quarter financial performance. As Kevin mentioned, we delivered solid revenue and earnings growth in the quarter. Revenue was up 9% or 7% adjusted for currency commodity acquisitions and divestitures. Our operating margins expanded 10 basis points to 13.7% and earnings per share grew 19%. Operating cash flow increased to $575 million driven by higher earnings levels and improved working capital performance partially offset by higher restructuring outflows.","Slide 14 provides greater detail of revenue for the quarter. Starting on the left, we had strong sales growth including the impact of M&A, driven by HellermannTyton, which contributed approximately $200 million of revenue. The impact from the Japan earthquake was within the range we provided in April. The strengthening U.S. dollar, principally against the Chinese RMB and pound, and lower copper prices were a drag on revenue in the quarter.","Moving to the right. South America continues to be very weak. Growth in North America and Europe was strong, driven primarily by our Electrical Architecture and DNS segments. Our adjusted growth in China slowed in the quarter to approximately 5%, reflecting volatility in schedules at certain customers, including SGM and Great Wall. While our overall view of full-year China vehicle production growth remains unchanged at approximately 4%, we expect fluctuations in quarterly growth over market rates to continue in the second half the year.","Turning to operating income. Slide 15 walks the year-over-year change for the second quarter. Overall, our operating results were in line with our expectations. Flow-through from volume growth contributed to margin expansion. HellermannTyton was accretive to earnings and our integration activities and synergy realization continue on pace. Although we did experience some regional performance challenges in the quarter within North American manufacturing and Electrical Architecture, which I'll speak to in a moment, launch costs in E&S moderated in the quarter, as expected. Also, as Kevin referenced, we see significant opportunities in areas such as active safety, automated driving, infotainment and vehicle electrification and continue to increase investment in these areas.","As always, we continue our relentless focus on optimizing our cost structure, leveraging best cost locations and driving increased efficiencies throughout our organization to fund continued investment in innovation and to help offset the impact of the discrete performance challenges that I just noted.","Slide 16 takes us through performance by segment. Electrical Architecture, consistent with our expectations, grew 8% on an adjusted basis. HellermannTyton growth was 10%. As I mentioned, operating margin flow-through at Electrical Architecture was negatively impacted by manufacturing performance challenges in North America totaling approximately $20 million. During the quarter, we experienced lower efficiency and higher labor costs associated with the previously planned consolidation of facilities. We expect some level of inefficiency to continue into the second half and have included an additional $30 million in our full-year guidance.","Powertrain revenues were flat year-over-year and short of our expectations. As solid growth in our gas business, GDI grew 50% in the quarter, was offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes in North America, a decline in light duty diesel schedules in Europe and lower China volumes. With respect to light duty diesel, towards the end of the second quarter, our Powertrain segment experienced a decrease in order levels impacting both the second quarter and the back half of 2016 across multiple customers. We believe the reduced order levels are primarily related to customers managing down overall diesel inventories in Europe and Asia Pacific. The Powertrain margin decline of approximately 50 basis points was driven by the decline in volumes as well as the foreign exchange transaction impact, primarily associated with the devaluation of the RMB and pound.","As expected, Electronics & Safety organic growth accelerated to 14%, reflecting revenues from program launches completed in late 2015 and earlier this year. The growth for the quarter includes a drag of approximately 2% for the mechatronics business. Growth was strong across several product lines, including active safety and infotainment, which grew over 40% and 10% in the quarter, respectively, as well as power electronics, which although currently a small revenue base, grew significantly in the quarter. E&S margins expanded 10 basis points to 12.4% on strong volume growth and positive net performance as launch inefficiencies continued to wane. As noted, we continue to increase investment in key technologies that drive growth in E&S, particularly in active safety, automated driving and infotainment.","Turning to slide 17. Earnings came in in the high end of our range, despite a slightly higher tax rate of 17.4% versus a 17% forecast. EPS growth was driven by increased operating earnings and a favorable impact of a lower share count. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04 per share, including $0.03 from operations and $0.01 improvement from below-the-line items.","Turning to slide 18 and the outlook for the remainder of the year. I'd like to walk through the changes to our full-year revenue and operating income guidance. Starting with revenue on the left, full-year revenues are expected to be $16.25 billion to $16.45 billion with operating income between $2.15 billion and $2.2 billion. The updated revenue guidance reflects a reduction of $450 million from our previous midpoint, including a $200 million reduction related to FX translation and commodities, primarily resulting again from the weakening Chinese RMB, British pound and lower copper prices. Reduced global vehicle production accounts for the remainder of the decrease of $250 million.","The lower production volumes reflect our views regarding continued weakness in the CB market, the estimated impact of Brexit and lower light duty diesel volumes. In addition, we have included an estimate of lower volumes in China related to certain OEs primarily impacting the Powertrain segment. As a result, at a segment level, we now expect Electrical Architecture adjusted growth of 6%, Powertrain growth of 3% and E&S growth of 14%.","E&S and Electrical Architecture will continue to provide strong growth throughout the year for Delphi. Accordingly, we expect our full-year adjusted growth rate to be approximately 7%, reflecting growth over market of roughly 5%. The earnings impact of the foreign exchange headwinds and the flow-through on lower volumes, including the lower performance in Electrical Architecture, will be partially offset by continued optimization of our cost structure.","In addition to accelerating previously planned restructuring actions, we continue to identify additional opportunities to reduce costs in the second half of the year. We expect full-year operating margin of 13.3%, a 30-basis-point expansion over last year. We have tightened and raised the midpoint of our full-year EPS guidance to $5.95 to $6.05 reflecting year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint.","Moving to the third quarter. We expect to generate revenues of $3.9 billion to $4 billion. The midpoint reflects further organic growth acceleration to 8% with continued strong growth in Electronics and Safety and Electrical Architecture. We expect operating income in the range of $505 million to $525 million and third quarter earnings per share of $1.38 to $1.44, up approximately 10% at the midpoint.","Turning to slide 19. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and is an important lever to enhance shareholder value. On the left, we expect cash flow from operations to grow approximately $1.9 billion, in line with earnings, and the deployment priorities on the right are consistent with our strategy, maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade rating. We are investing in our business through capital expenditures supporting new program launches, ongoing cost alignment, and footprint rotation to best cost countries.","We are committed to paying a competitive dividend, and when we have excess cash, we have a track record of returning it to shareholders via share repurchases, as evidenced by the $435 million of repurchases we've already done this year. Our full year guidance assumes repurchases for the year of $600 million and we continue to pursue inorganic growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria and strategic growth objectives, particularly around expansion of our Electrical Architecture platform, active safety and automated driving technologies as well as infotainment and power electronics. I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some closing remark before we open it up to questions.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Joe. Wrapping up on slide 20. We delivered solid performance in the second quarter despite a few challenges. Our financial performance continues to be driven by the relevant, safe, green and connected technologies that solve some of our customers' biggest challenges. We're confident in our second half outlook which includes 7% organic growth, roughly 60 basis points of margin expansion, and mid-teens EPS growth.","We continue to optimize our cost structure while investing in technologies that will drive our future growth. Our year-to-date bookings and commercial developments position us well for continued strong revenue and earnings growth. And as Joe just said, we remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, investing in both organic as well as inorganic growth and returning excess cash to shareholders through both share repurchases as well as dividends. Through all this, we remain focused on executing in a more dynamic macro environment during the back half of this is year and with that we'll now turn it over to the operator to open up the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning, Rod.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning, Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I had a couple questions. One is just about the growth outlook. So, I think that your prior expectation for Delphi's outperformance versus your weighted average exposures was something like 900 basis points in the back half, and now it looks like around 600 basis points, which is up from the 300 basis points to 400 basis points in the first half. But can you talk a little bit about the bridge a little bit more, the bridge to that number? What, for example, specifically is happening in China? What are some of the specific drivers of that acceleration if you can just comment on programs that are launching and how much meaningful those would be?","And lastly, I know it's a long question, but we always get questions about how confident we should be about the growth guidance longer term and you guys have been talking about 8% to 10% as you look out to 2017 and beyond. Is there any reason, just given some of these variances that we're seeing, is there any reason to reassess that longer term excess growth assumption?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","If it's okay, Joe, I'll start at a higher level and you can fill in the blanks with the details.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I think, listen, as you look at our adjusted outlook for the back half of the year from a growth standpoint, as Joe referenced, there's really three key components.","One is FX and commodity rates in the translation effect and Joe quantified that as roughly $200 million. Then there's two separate pieces on volume. Piece one is effectively lower outlook or lower forecast from IHS and customers for vehicle production across the back half of the year, one. And then specific growth relative to market for us principally in our Powertrain segment. So I think, Rod, if you look at growth over market in our E&S segment, I think if you look at growth over market in our Electrical Architecture segment, quite frankly the outlook remains unchanged.","Where it has changed somewhat, at least in the near term, is on the Powertrain side and it's principally being driven by a couple things. One, light duty diesel growth, and again I'll let Joe comment on that; much lower commercial vehicle growth. And then when we look at the mix of customers run in China, an incremental effect related to growth over market there. As we look at the back half of the year and risk related to revenue, I tell you we feel very good about where we stand from a revenue outlook, very good where we stand.","And as we head into the back half of the year, we'll reassess each of our businesses in each of the markets and take another view about longer term outlook for growth. Having said that, I would tell you if you look at our growth over market for calendar year 2016, even on a revised basis, is very strong relative to overall vehicle production at five points over market. So, Joe, I'll let you add more specifics.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So let me just expand a little bit on detail. So Kevin mentioned of the $450 million, $200 million's FX and commodities. Again, FX translation effects, and it's about 50\/50. Commodities, primarily copper, is another $100 million. Of the $250 million, right now we see industry volumes of about $100 million coming out. That's based on updated production information that we have, includes some insight into what folks are thinking from a Brexit perspective and impact on Europe. The remaining $150 million, which would be more of the growth over market impact, the diesel, which is both commercial vehicle and light duty is $100 million of that $150 million, and then China we've adjusted down $50 million.","As I mentioned in my script, as Kevin touched on, we have seen customer specific adjustments to schedules. I would almost refer to them as model specific adjustments, some inventory balancing we think in the back half of the year. Certainly, and primarily in Powertrain. Certainly nowhere at the level of schedule call downs that we saw last year so this is very different. It's model specific. It's customer specific. Really concentrated in two or three customers on a couple of platforms. But we did see those \u2013 sorry, go ahead.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, can you just maybe give us a couple examples of programs that are meaningful to \u2013 you still are experiencing somewhat of an acceleration in outperformance in the back half. Are there two or three programs that you can cite that could be meaningful? And then also at a higher level, Powertrain sounds like a lot of it's there and organic growth was like zero in the quarter. Obviously there's some cyclical headwinds there. There's also other issues of course, with real world driving emissions and the costs of complying with the new diesel standards. Are there any changes longer term that you think are affecting the market dynamic there in terms of either growth or the competitiveness that would affect Powertrain?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Why don't you respond to \u2013 why don't you talk about some of the launch volume that's driving revenue growth in the back half and then I can comment on Powertrain.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay. Yeah, Rod, and we tried to address this because we know this question's come up before. If we look at slide nine of the deck, particularly the ones in the left-hand side, those are really the platforms that, for us, in the back half of the year, are generating the volume growth. Higher content for us, infotainment, active safety-type products, Electrical Architecture so we've got the electrical distribution system in those products. We've got a couple of examples on it.","The VW example, we've got the Tiguan up there, but that's actually \u2013 that entire platform that we are on that is launching in the back half of the year, the MQB platform. So for us, that's an important one. That's a big one and it's across actually all three segments. We have content from all three segments on that vehicle. So that slide's designed to provide some insight into what we see driving volume in the back half.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And on the Powertrain side, Rod, our view, as Joe said today is, it's principally Europe related, European OE. Based on our discussions with those OEs, it appears to be inventory rebalancing at this point in time. It's something we're watching closely. But one thing I want to underscore and get back to, as we all know, governments are focused on whether it's the U.S. or Europe, always hitting the revised standards.","And to the extent there's less light duty diesel, there needs to be more Powertrain electrification and I think over \u2013 although there may be slight dislocations in the near term, over the medium to long term, when you look at where we sit from a power electronics standpoint, and we've cited these facts before, the average CPV on a standard internal combustion engine for Delphi is $300. When we look at 48-volt it's four times that CPV. On a hybrid is five times, on a full EV it's seven times, and given our product portfolio, we're certainly well positioned.","And I think that overall trend is why we're seeing such a significant ramp up in growth in power electronics. Joe said, off of a low number, it's a very high growth rate, but when you look at what we're seeing from a bookings standpoint, just to give you a data point, the first half of last year, we booked roughly $400 million on power electronic vehicle electrification. In the first half of this year, we're over $1.2 billion. So what we're seeing, stepping back and taking a look at a big picture, is significant ramp up in demand for Powertrain electronics or electrification of the Powertrain, which is good for us.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Morning John.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, John.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just to kind of follow up on this Powertrain discussion, in the short run, GDI really should be backfilling unless there's something else going on, and I understand there could be some disruption for a couple quarters as there is an inventory adjustment. Just curious if you're seeing that pickup as an offset or there's something else going on here. And when you look at the restructuring you're doing in Powertrain, is that directly expressly addressing this issue or is that sort of a more ongoing Western to Eastern European restructuring?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, GDI, we are seeing it, John. I mentioned GDI growth was over 50% in the quarter. Relatively speaking, that's about a $300 million business, so there's a little bit of \u2013 it's growing fast and we're very excited about it and it will fill that hole. But there's going to be somewhat of a timing just as diesel comes down. It's obviously a much larger business. But we have seen very strong growth in the second quarter, and quite honestly, expect full-year growth in GDI to be a little bit over 50%. So, we are seeing that.","Restructuring, I would say we are moving a little bit quicker on restructuring in Powertrain. Some of that's opportunistic. I would say at this point it's still consistent with a footprint rotation from west to east, particularly in Europe, although, as you may recall, that is diesel focused. Those are diesel facilities that we are consolidating into taking out of Western Europe. There was one last year in France. There's another one this year in Spain and they're going into Romania. So, it is diesel focused, but still consistent with the overall plan.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Listen, John, it's important to note, a lot of dialogue right now about light duty diesel, but our outlook for light duty diesel, FX adjusted, is it's going to grow. It's going to grow 1% year-over-year versus a prior outlook of roughly 3% year-over-year.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a second question on the growth above market. I think that a lot of people simplistically, ourselves included sometimes, look at the schedules on the light vehicle side and plug in your growth above market on top of that. But there's two components that I think we might miss with that, and that is mix on the light vehicle side, but also the pressure or benefits that you might be getting from the commercial vehicle side.","So is there a better way to express this or think about this more simplistically as a total growth number as opposed to a growth above market as far as your targets that might encompass that? I'm just curious, as we think about mix on the light vehicle side and then also the commercial vehicle side, what kind of impact, in general, you think that is having positively or negative in the business in the near term and the long term?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, no, that's a good question and something maybe we need to be consistently clear. When we talk about market, we're including commercial vehicle market in our production numbers. And commercial vehicle, as you know, is roughly 10% of our total revenues, principally in the Powertrain area.","Our outlook, for instance, on the commercial vehicle side is for the global market to be down roughly 3% on a year-over-year basis with the biggest driver of that low growth or no growth really being the North America market. But it's encompassed in the production numbers that we communicate to you and the growth numbers regarding market that we communicate.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just three really quick housekeeping issues. What is the cash component of the restructuring and what is the payback period that you're expecting? And then also on Powertrain, there was a big step-up in D&A to $67 million in the quarter, I think it was like $40 million something in the first quarter. Just curious if something was going on there. And then the exact share repo number you're expecting specifically for the second half of the year.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so let me start with the share repo number. We've got, included in our guidance assumptions for the full year $600 million, so that would be versus the $435 million year-to-date. So that is obviously increasing share repurchases. And Q3 and Q4, if you did that math, we are assuming acceleration off of the Q2 level of about $65 million. If I understood your first question was \u2013 and I'm sorry, I missed the middle one. The first part of your question was cash flow on restructuring in the year?","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, the restructuring charge that you took in the quarter, how much of that is cash and what is the payback period you're expecting from these restructuring charges?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, that one will pretty much flow through this year. That primarily relates to the closure of Barcelona and Powertrain in Spain. Paybacks on those types of plant moves, they do vary and we tend to see anywhere from 3.5 to 4.5 years. Again, that may sound long, but those are complicated plants to move. That's one of the reasons why they're still there and they're obviously in Western Europe, so there's a little bit more expense. But on Powertrain, European Powertrain plant moves, that tends to be the range of payback.","Elena Dom Rosman - Vice President-Investor Relations","The other question was on D&A relative to the CapEx when you did Powertrain.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","The D&A stepped up to $67 million versus I think it was about $44 million in the first quarter. It just seems like with write-downs, that should be a number that might go down as opposed to going up that much.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, that's fair. Although we have expanded capacity in China and in Eastern Europe, which is increasing that D&A number. The other thing just to think about is these plants that are closing in Western Europe have been around for a while, so their relative depreciation burns a lot less than some of the newer facilities. So even though we are taking those offline and getting out of them, it's got a slightly different depreciation expense profile.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Very helpful. Thanks so much.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, have a longer-term question. Good morning. Tied to the 48-volt and electrification move and then more of a below-the-line question on tax rate. With the longer-term evolution towards partial hybridization, whether it's 48-volt or Prius-style hybrids, you have talked about the 3 to 7X CPV move.","But questions we're getting are couple things. Basically it boils down to what are the margins likely to be in that future world? What's the competitive environment, given there are players out there clearly servicing Toyota's needs on the hybrid side? Is it going to be as concentrated and hence maybe as profitable as the Powertrain business has proven to be? And especially since a lot of it's wiring and wiring a fair amount is copper price through?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, when you talk about the entire system, our outlook for this space's margins would be roughly in line with the blended rate between Electrical Architecture and Electronics and Safety. Because what we're focused on selling, Brian, as we've discussed with you in the past, is really the full system. Obviously, there's a period of time when you ramp up new programs or products like this where there's more investing than there is earning.","I can tell you we've talked about EVs or vehicle electrification for quite a while here, and as you know, there was a point in time where we were investing far more than we were earning. This year we're at a point where it's a profitable product line. Not quite at the levels that we're at for E\/ES and E\/EA (39:04) today, but certainly on a good track to achieve those levels.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And I think just one addition to that, Brian, is as volume comes up, we start to see the benefit of material savings and just being able to acquire or procure better. Obviously, as these product lines start out at relatively low levels, we don't see that type of material performance year-over-year.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Second question is around, given the UK referendum results, the sustainability of the 17% tax rate. I know it's early days. I know there are lots of tax treaties that would need to be renegotiated. But could you help us through the impact, the risk factors in terms of remaining EU members trying to tax operations locally, the offsets, especially with your move to Eastern Europe, that you might have with that and how you're thinking about that?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. It is something we are paying close attention to. I think the dust to some extent has obviously settled after all of the activity at the end of June. To your point, it is going to take a long time. So there are a couple of things that we're watching and will be mindful of from what I'll call from a tax structure perspective. Those are primarily around how the European Union and the UK interact or contract effectively post-Brexit. At this point, we don't see anything that materially changes our tax rate. So if from a tax policy perspective there aren't any single major drivers that if they were to change now would have a material impact to the 17% tax rate.","Obviously, if new treaties and such are struck, new agreements are reached, particularly if it's punitive to UK-based companies, we'd obviously have to evaluate how to either structure around those or look at other alternatives. I would caveat, I think the one thing that's \u2013 our tax structure is a little bit unique in Europe because even though we're UK-based, we have a significant presence in Europe. So it's not necessarily one of these tax structures that's built on what I'll call just planning initiatives. We have a large physical presence in the UK. We have large physical presences in Luxembourg, and our structure tends to be built around how we do business in Europe, how we do business in the UK versus just one-off planning actions. So that tends to be more substantive and tends to hold up better to tax law changes, i.e., things get grandfathered and such.","So right now, we see no risk. Hopefully that answers the question. But again, at this point, we see no risk at this point to the 17%. There's nothing out there that we're looking at saying, boy, we need to go change it now. But obviously something we will continue to watch diligently as we go forward.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And, if I can add, you are at present, continue to do scenario planning and what if analysis so that we're in front of it versus behind it.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yep, we are.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Did that answer the question, Brian? I know it was a little open ended.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, no, about as much as we can know at this point.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pat Archambault from Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Oh, yeah. Good morning.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Morning, Patrick.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","A couple from me. Just on the third quarter. It was disproportionately lower than what we expected and consensus did and the growth rate obviously is somewhat subdued in terms of operating income and just wanted to get a sense of why that is in 3Q in particular. I take it, it's some of the factor is just an extension of a few of the items that you highlighted, particularly some of the operational issues, right, the $20 million that becomes $30 million, but maybe just I'll leave it there and just see if you can give us the line items so we can better understand that sort of sequential year-on-year move if you will.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I think it's a combination of those. So you're right. The E\/EA performance, the Powertrain revenue, those impact the third quarter a little bit more, as you think about the back half of the year than the fourth quarter. We've also got, we continue to launch products in E\/EA and E&S and those are more Q4 launches, so you've got a little bit of the items that are weighing us down are a little bit heavier in Q3 with some additional growth coming in in the fourth quarter, which is what's giving you that look.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","In actuality, Patrick, the growth rate accelerates in Q3.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","In Q3, 8%, yep.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Actually in growth over market, so it's on a relative basis a strong growth quarter. Operationally, to the point Joe talked about, there's launch costs as well as some of the manufacturing inefficiencies in mix Powertrain relative to our other business from a margin standpoint.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it and just related to that, the impact of the supply issue in Japan. You said it came in kind of in line with what you expected and was supposed to be made up for in the back half. Maybe can we just put some numbers around that and remind us of your latest thinking there?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So the impact in Q2 was about $40 million to $50 million. We had $50 million as the bottom of our range so we're basically at the bottom end of the range. You know, I think as you think about it in the back half of the year, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. The way I think about it is we called off revenue of about $100 from an industry volume perspective in the back of the year. The Japan impact, or the recovery of that, is effectively netted in there. And it's case by case. Some customers you clearly saw come back. Others talked about it, not coming back, but maybe as it related to some of the other inventory adjustments. So less of an impact in Q2 and effectively netted within our industry, a volume adjustment in the back half of the year.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And if I can just ask one maybe more theoretical or longer term question. On slide 11, you know, found this announcement interesting when you made it. Is there \u2013 I mean you mentioned Columbus, Ohio, I think the Smart City Challenge winner and Boston, I think. Is there anybody doing kind of robotaxi like Singapore is? When we've looked at it, seems like most municipalities are just starting with some kind of an automated bus or shuttle system. And Singapore seems to be, by far, the most ambitious. But you guys having delved into it a lot more deeply, wanted to see if that's what you were seeing as well.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, Singapore's the most advanced from a plan to get to, use your term, robot taxis, and we've been working with them or planning with them for about the past year. There are several other cities that are talking about it at this point in time, that we're talking with, providing the same sort of service and solution. But when you look at Singapore in terms of actually executing, we're in a situation now where we've launched a program.","We'll have piloted vehicles for two years through the end of 2018 and actually pilotless vehicles beginning in 2019. And their plan is to have pilotless vehicles, a fleet of pilotless vehicles in the areas that we're currently testing beyond 2020 servicing consumers. So they, by far and away, are the further along. But when you look at other U.S. cities, there certainly are examples. London's talking about it, Amsterdam's talking about it. They're looking at it where we're located outside of Shanghai in Anting, so there's a lot of dialogue, but Singapore's first.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. All right, well, extremely interesting. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Leiker from Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, everyone.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, David.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Morning, David.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Kevin, I wanted to touch on, I guess two things. One is on the 48-volt launches that you have coming up in the contract, the bookings that you have. Are these bookings that go into vehicles that are meant to be a small portion of the fleet, kind of test-type applications or are they broader in scale where an entire vehicle platform may end up being a 48-volt?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, listen, I think it's ultimately an entire vehicle platform. It's lower volume today. So, as I mention to you, we have, through the second quarter, $200 million of total bookings, including those two programs that are going to launch next year with European OEs. But they're launching on vehicles that tend to have a significant amount of volume. So, I'd call it beyond a test, but it certainly is not high volume in this case. And when you go through the economics and the discussions that we're having with \u2013 based on the discussions we're having with the other OEs at this point in time, and you talk about the technology, the cost of the technology, and the benefit of the technology, we think this is something that is going to gain significant traction. As do those OEs.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, the economics make a lot of sense there. And then on the autonomous driving side, there's been discussion here in the last few weeks of trying to create some industry standards for the sensor suite, the algorithms, the applications to accelerate the path through regulations, through development and ultimately lower the cost curve on that. What's Delphi's view on that and your ability to participate in something along those lines?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, listen, ultimately, if you were to break the market down into two spaces, if you were to look at the mobility providers, the non-traditional OEs, I think they're less focused on a standard and they're less price sensitive. For them, it's about the economics of drivers and more vehicles, so it's a slightly different answer. But I think for the traditional OEs, having a standard makes significant sense. And it's, to your point, what will drive down cost and ultimately will drive up penetration. And our view is with some of the recent events and certainly the dialogues out of Washington, that's something you're going to see more pressure on or a greater push towards.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And where do you see Delphi? Are you part of a group that drives that? Do you take the baton and drive that effort to standardization? What's your role?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, when you look at the suite of products we have from both hardware to software, as well as some of the partnerships that we have, we think we're ideally positioned with support, quite frankly, from others to actually be one of the leaders in the supply base driving that.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. What is your outlook for...","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. What is your outlook for the Chinese government tax incentives on smaller engine vehicles? Do you presume in your forecast that this goes away at the end of the year or that it is extended? And if you presume it goes away, does it provide any sort of a bump in the fourth quarter on like pre-buy?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","At this point, we've assumed that, and this is as much a 2017 question. We assume it ends just for lack of any better information. I would tell you we have had some discussions internally about pre-buys. Haven't necessarily seen a big push from customer schedules perspective yet. It's not too late to flow some of that. China's going to be, just from a year-over-year comp perspective, a little interesting for everyone, not just us, for everyone in Q3, Q4, just give the volatility from last year. And last Q4 was obviously a very strong quarter in China. But at this point, I'm assuming it ends at the end of the year and have yet to see any big discernible pull as a result of it ending.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. And then the last question is just on the M&A environment. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that you continue to pursue inorganic growth opportunities that meet your investment criteria. So I'm just curious what that environment looks like \u2013 the ability to find attractive companies at attractive prices. Presumably the companies are out there, but relative to attractive prices, how to think about that. Because the stock market is at an all-time record high, and yet the prices and multiples for automotive companies are so down. So what's the more important metric, the valuation of the market overall? If you're going to buy a technology-type company? Or the valuation of automotive companies?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Listen, Ryan, I think each situation is unique. When you look at the high tech companies, you're right, you certainly have seen valuations increase. That's partly why Joe and his team are, in addition to focusing on investment opportunities out of Silicon Valley, actually doing more activity outside of Silicon Valley from a prospecting standpoint. And we'll probably talk about, more about that later this year.","From a more traditional acquisition standpoint, listen, we have a fairly simple and straightforward perspective, and it's really cash-on-cash returned. We look at those as traditional cash flow investments and they need to generate the right return on invested capital for us to go forward and make those investments, including both purchase price; certainly on the outflow, but when you look at performance of the business, margin expansion opportunities and synergies.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey, Colin.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Just on a follow-up on the Singapore fleet, any color on how these vehicles would work? I mean, are they going to be geographically range bound, limited to certain routes, any feed restrictions? Will they work in all weather? Just kind of curious how these will be deployed initially.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, they will be geographically range bound. There's an area called One North, which it's about five square miles, five square mile space where they will be, resident to. It's residential and commercial. As I mentioned, for the first two years of the program, beginning now, we actually have a vehicle there now. We'll have six vehicles there by the end of next year. For what it's worth, five of which will be fully electric vehicles. They'll be piloted for two years and then they will be pilotless beginning in year three, and they'll operate in and around that range.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And on the 48-volt technology, how is your technology different from your peers? Do you think, particularly on the vehicles that you are launching on, did you need to partner things like battery, any motor, or do the OEMs find those components on their own? And overall do you think this has any impact on the full EV demands? Seems like pretty viable bridge to fuel economy at a more reasonable cost.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, our outlook, when you look at our outlook for the market for HEV, EV, by 2025 we're still, our perspective is they make up high teens percentage of overall vehicle production with full electrics representing roughly 2% to 3%, and 48-volt representing roughly 15% of the vehicle production, which, six months ago the IHS outlook was that they were worth 10 points of that growth.","And when you look at the economics, it's a no brainer, quite frankly. When you look at what Delphi brings to the party in addition to systems integration, from a products standpoint, we bring everything with the exception of the e-motor, the e-turbo and battery, and the solution that we're offering we're partnering with others to offer those solutions to OEs. And it would be our intention longer term to continue to partner with third parties versus develop internal capabilities in those areas.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you very much for taking my question.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I was wondering if you could just help me a little bit more with the fourth quarter margin year-over-year bridge because if my math's right, you're pointing to something like about like 13.9%. And I know on the year-ago period, you dealt with all the inefficiencies in China from the rapid ramp up. But it also sounds like you're talking about some continued inefficiencies in the back half. So I was just wondering if I'm missing anything else big that helps bridge that improvement.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. You're thinking about, you've got the right components. So we had inefficiencies, $25 million to $30 million last year in China as we dealt with the whipsaw around the volume ramp. That's obviously not there. That comes out. We will see a little bit of inefficiency, the current E\/EA inefficiencies in North America. We'll see those wind down over the course of the quarter so think of that as roughly $10 million in the fourth quarter.","Fourth quarter is usually strong for us. Fourth quarter is usually strong for us as well, remember, as we have NRE and we have non-recurring engineering. We get a lot of our reimbursements in the fourth quarter, particularly in the E&S and Powertrain businesses, so that margin rate is typically stronger in the fourth quarter as a result of that. And we continue to see that and call that $20 million or so if you wanted a range about it.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I think, Joe, having been around a little bit longer than Joe, if you go back and look at 2014 versus 2013 fourth quarter, so on and so forth, you'll note fourth quarter margins tend to be our highest. And it's for the reasons that Joe just talked about it. So it's really in line on a more normalized comparison.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Can you just remind me, the $25 million to $30 million in inefficiencies in China last year, was that mostly in Powertrain or how did that break down?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Mostly in Electrical Architecture.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Electrical Architecture, okay.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then just quickly on the Singapore deal. I guess it seems like this draws heavily on maybe the Ottomatika acquisition. I was wondering if there's a little bit of a change in strategy with that asset where you're going more after this shared mobility concept versus potentially selling that to OEs who seem to be on the margin wanting to do maybe a little bit more of that work in-house. And then, A, is that true? And then, B, for this deal, how does the OE or other partners get involved in this? I guess why did they come to you as the first point of entry?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, they came to us because we provide the full suite of services and they were less focused on what type of vehicle we're actually using. So the vehicle over there right now is actually, it's another Audi SQ5. The additional five vehicles that we're going to select, it's a choice between two OEs. I don't want to get into that. They'll be fully electric.","And they're really focused less on the car, but how does the overall system work. Not only the vehicle, but also how does the vehicle interact from an infrastructure standpoint and how do we put a cloud-based system in that allows the government of Singapore to operate a mobility-on-demand service. Okay, so it goes above and beyond that so that they can drop that service in. So I would say that's an expansion of what we've previously contemplated. We think there's a lot they will learn. There's a lot we will learn.","I think the mobility-on-demand, quite frankly, what you're seeing is a space of the market moving much faster to get automated driving than the traditional OEs. And although all the traditional OEs are very focused on it and, as you know, some are further along than others, when you look at the non-traditional players out there in the mobility space, they're moving much more aggressively, much faster and it seems to be a bigger priority. And we want to be a part of that. We want to be one of the first movers in that.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So is it fair to assume that the Ottomatika asset has shifted a little bit towards providing that type of solution versus trying to position that more to OEs for owned autonomy, if you will?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No, listen, I don't think the strategy has changed at all. I guess given the pace of change and the desire to move quickly, the mobility providers, the non-traditional folks out there, are looking to ramp it up faster and therefore are more interested in that part of Ottomatika that we have to offer. The traditional OEs, there are some that we're working with or providing Ottomatika algorithms to. There are others, to your point, that are developing their own.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lim from Wells Fargo Securities.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning, David.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Morning. Just a couple quick questions. Are you seeing any risk to North American production in the second half? I know that your latest guidance takes all the latest information into consideration, but we're seeing some inventory heaviness in certain segment pockets.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, David, we're obviously watching it very closely. There was obviously an announcement last week with Ford and such. At this point, what we see is in the forecast. We haven't had any updates or we have not seen any softening at this point beyond the volume estimates that we have provided.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. And then recent news this morning, Samsung, Marelli discussions there. How would that impact your infotainment business from a competitive standpoint? And then secondly, would you guys consider selling off infotainment, obviously, if there was the right price for it?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, let me start with the last and then Joe and I can respond to the first. Listen, our infotainment business we consider to be very strategic. Joe talked about the growth rates. It's going to grow close to 20% this year and I think accelerates in 2017 and beyond. So it's a great space and we think it's a great space where you're going to see convergence between active safety, infotainment, cluster technology. We're starting to see that today and we think we got a great position in it.","Having said that, we're about how do we maximize return to shareholders. And from that perspective, I guess I would never say never, but I think it's highly unlikely based on what we view the opportunities to be in that space.","With respect to the story today about Samsung and Magneti Marelli, listen, we're very familiar with both companies. And if that were something to happen, it's not something that we're overly concerned about.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. As always, thanks for the color.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No problem.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning, Emmanuel.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Just first, a quick point of clarification on China and the issues you're seeing with certain automakers in the Powertrain business. When you look at the full-year outlook by now, I think up until now you've expected to outperform the market quite a bit. What is your outlook for full year, your own full-year China revenue in comparison to the market now?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, so we're right now looking at full-year China growth of 9%, adjusted growth of 9%. As I mentioned, we have a view of China production growth at about 4%, so we're 5% over market on the full year. Again, there'll be some bouncing around in Q3 and Q4 with those rates obviously just given what happened last year and just the comparables year-over-year. But full year, when it settles, 9% growth and about 5% over market.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just shifting to the ADAS opportunity. Obviously, a significant content opportunity over time. At the same time, a lot of these components seem to be becoming significantly cheaper very quickly and obviously a lot of it has to do with ramping up volume. What is the environment you're seeing in terms of price progression for active safety, content and component? And is that still, in terms of getting that to reasonable margin, is that still consistent with it?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, our price outlook hasn't changed. We still think around 2% is the right number for Delphi overall. We actually were a little lower than that in Q2. You're right. Electronics and Safety tends to be our one segment where we're priced just a little bit higher, 2.5% to 3%. But again, we're comfortable with that range. Don't see things significantly changing and as I mentioned, one benefit that we do see to margin over time and expect to continue to see, as these newer product lines grow in volume, material savings also becomes more available to us. So as we buy more, we're able to leverage that spend better. A product line at $100 million, there's only so much leverage you can do. As these get to $0.5 billion and beyond, there's obviously more leverage over a supply base.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, Emmanuel, and if I can add. We're now at a point, we've talked previously, we talked specifically to active safety, about an investing mode. We're in profit mode now. It's not where E&S margins are, but we're clearly making money. I think with respect to price pressure with specifically as it relates to active safety, it really somewhat depends on what sort of active safety solution you're talking about, right? If it's Level 1 where it's just a camera or just a radar right? As you know, we're in an industry that commoditizes itself very, very quickly. And to Joe's point, we're really good at getting cost out when we get volume and leveraging the manufacturing plant as well as getting material savings. As you get into integrated solution where you're fusing sensors, that's a much different scenario, and there are only a few players that can actually do that, we being one of them. And I think in those sorts of scenarios, and that's where this space is headed. In those sort of scenarios, the pricing pressure is actually very reasonable. It's there. It's always there but it's much more reasonable.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Two quick questions I think.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey Brett.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","One, given the lower organic growth expected here in this year, should we just immediately assume that next year and the following year the organic growth rate is likely to also step down by maybe a comparable amount or is that an unreasonable expectation?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Listen, we're looking at 2017 now. If we were to start with overall outlook for global vehicle production today, if we were to snap the chalk line including passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle, our outlook is roughly 1% volume growth. With respect to growth over market, that's something we're still working through. I would think it's roughly in line with what we're seeing this year or more, depending on what we see in terms of acceleration in active safety, infotainment, power electronics, all the areas that Joe just talked about.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then the second question is, you're competing against very formidable competitors, whether it be active safety or connectivity or autonomous driving vehicles, and so forth. My question is, does the fact that you have an Electrical Architecture business give you an advantage, or is it more along the lines of it's a separate business that just is growing as vehicles are electrifying? I guess I'm wondering if there's synergies between that and the other portions of your business that maybe gives you a leg up versus, let's say, a Bosch or a Conti or somebody else along those lines?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, listen, to your point, they're terrific competitors. They have great technologies, as do we. But having Electrical Architecture that really enables, right? It's an enabler of everything that we're talking about, whether it's active safety, automated driving, or vehicle electrification, electrification of the powertrain.","And having the ability to combine that knowhow with what we know at E&S and Powertrain in areas, for example like zFAS, which we're doing for VW. Combining those capabilities is significant. We're looking at similar opportunities from a technology standpoint as it relates to infotainment in clusters. So having that capability and the ability to take out cost and take out complexity, based on our experience in that segment, is huge.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I think \u2013 Kevin mentioned earlier, I think 48-volt's another great example that. If you think of we have to partner on the motor, the e-turbo and the battery but the rest of the content in that 48-volt vehicle is Delphi content. And without the Electrical Architecture business, it would obviously not be possible to put that system together at that level. So, vehicle electrification is clearly going to be one where both the Powertrain business and E\/EA are able to collaborate and benefit.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much, gentlemen.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Chris McNally from Evercore.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Thanks, guys.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning, Chris.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Just a follow-up on the customer drags within Powertrain, similar to some of the questions at the beginning of the call. Is there a way to think about this as a customer-specific diesel production issue? Or is it really several customers in a representation of a broader lower diesel sales?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's more than one customer. We'll call it four customers. I do think there is some consistency in what we're seeing across those customers. They are \u2013 and we've talked to each of them and we're obviously engaged.","The message back from them has the consistency of exactly what I had said, which is managing diesel inventories, heading into summer shutdowns for the back half of the year. And we're dealing with primarily European production, although there is some export to Asia-Pac\/India that we're seeing impacted as well. So again, hard to draw any broader conclusions than that. We are certainly not at this point. We've had very specific dialogues with the customers, but it is more than one. It isn't just one customer.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, so if I could augment Joe's comment. Listen, on the commercial side, it's straight market. It ended up being a very challenging market for anyone in that space. I think as you look at Powertrain and you look at light duty diesel, the reality is every OE has multiple Powertrain platforms. And there is some mix effect.","So to Joe's point, listen, we're seeing some dots and we're trying to connect the dots. They all may not be perfectly correlated because each OE has different inventory levels, quite frankly has different mix of vehicles, and those all come into play, so at times \u2013 at a given point in time, it can be some challenging calculus to give you a real specific answer.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Okay. When we start to isolate the risk, we should think about it as a diesel-specific issue related to some version of inventory sales rather than a broader Powertrain backlog, which I think has been, fairly so, investor's concerns, given Powertrain across multiple suppliers has been really where we've been having weakness.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, so I would say a light duty diesel-specific issue related to mix. Near term I wouldn't draw any conclusion about light duty diesel penetration from where we sit now that is any different than what we've communicated previously.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Agree.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Is that clear?","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Perfect.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Okay.","Operator","And that concludes \u2013 excuse me.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So, great. Well, listen, we appreciate everybody's time today. Thank you and have a great day.","Operator","That concludes the Delphi Q2 2016 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining.

As a reminder, this conference call is being accorded and simultaneously webcast. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Sherief Bakr Vice President of Investor Relations. Sherief, please go ahead.","Sherief Bakr","Thank you, Demetrius, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to Delphi Technologies' fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today in London is our Chief Executive Officer Rick Dauch; and our Chief Financial Officer, Vivid Sehgal.","This call will include a discussion of our fourth year and full year 2018 financial results as disclosed in today's press release as well as our outlook for 2019. And in order to follow along with today's presentation, you can find an accompanying set of slides on our Investor Relations website at ir.delphi.com.","Please note that our discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to their corresponding GAAP measures in the tables within our press release.","Now, before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements.

I'd encourage all of you to review these risk factors listed in these documents.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Dauch","Thank you, Sherief, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'm delighted to be speaking to you on my first earnings call here at Delphi Technologies. And I look forward to sharing some initial thoughts after my first seven weeks on the job and how I think about the value creation opportunity here for our shareholders.","I'll start with some high level comments on the progress we made in 2018 as a new company, highlighting some of the shorter term headwinds impacting us, and why I'm extremely confident in our long-term future. Vivid will then take you through the details of our fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2019 before we take your questions.","In many ways, 2018 was a milestone year for Delphi Technologies as we completed our first full year as a standalone public company. We continue to have great momentum with our customers driven by our industry-leading propulsion technologies and product offerings. We recorded gross bookings of almost $10 billion in 2018 which will drive our long-term profitable growth at a pace higher than the industry growth trends.","We also made strong progress in executing the separation from our former parent and we are on track to exit key transition service agreements over the course of 2019 which will allow us to further optimize our operating model and our overall cost structure.","We ended 2018 with a strong cash flow performance and a solid balance sheet. At the same time, we faced a number of challenges throughout the year that fall short of our initial pre-spin expectations.","The executive leadership team and I are committed to delivering on our commitments for 2019, ensuring we have a strong focus on cost reduction, stabilizing and improving key processes, and driving cash flow during a period of softer growth, while continuing to invest to support our longer term profitable growth opportunities, especially on our GDi and electrification businesses.","I have made it my priority to visit many of our major global locations and have solicited feedback from our leadership teams and workforce during those visits as well as from some of our key customers over the last two weeks to better understand some of these shorter term market and business dynamics we face here at Delphi.","I have already visited one-third of our operating sites with plans to visit 90% of all of our locations by 4\/01\/19. These visits are extremely helpful to me as the new CEO. At each stop, I learn more about our people, our products, our processes, our business partners and about the overall operating and financial performance of the business.","The good news is that the -- most of the challenges I see are either transitory in nature or can be addressed with additional organizational focus, greater operational discipline and more leadership accountability, which I aim to instill in the way we do business here going forward at Delphi Technologies.","Looking back at 2018, many of the headwinds we faced were driven by the unexpected acceleration of certain market-driven transitions. For example, we were impacted by: one, the pace of the program roll-off and declining penetration of European passenger car diesel towards GDi and Power Electronics; second, the economic slowdown and the evolution of our mix of customers in China; and three, our ability to scale our business in new technologies to meet customer demand, which includes building three brand-new plants for our rapidly growing electrification business in three different countries of the world.","While I expect these transitions to continue into 2019, it is clear to me that we will ultimately benefit here at Delphi over the long-term as we will be in a stronger position to better serve our customers, accelerate our growth and create value for our shareholders. We have some hard tough work ahead of us over the next 12 to 18 months to get through these transitions.","At the same time I was pleased to see our strong customer momentum and revenue growth in key technologies over the course of 2018. Specifically, Power Electronics saw more than 40% revenue growth and commercial vehicles delivered approximately 20% year-on-year top line growth. Those are boxcar numbers.","And while our GDi growth and operating performance fell short of our expectations, primarily driven by industry and customer dynamics in China and some self-inflicted launch challenges, we are set to see significant growth and improved performance over the coming years.","Let me turn to slide 2. Having spent the last 1.5 months immersing myself to the business, let me tell you why I'm even more bullish today about the opportunity ahead of us here at Delphi Technologies than I was when I took over on January 7. First, we have a rock-solid business strategy to profitably grow Delphi Technologies. It starts with our industry-leading portfolio of technologies and operating capabilities that sit at the crossroad and the heart of the propulsion revolution. Our technology leadership truly differentiates us from our peers and will allow us to outpace the industry from a growth perspective.","Second, our customers are relying on us to help them meet extremely stringent regulatory targets focused on cleaner and more efficient vehicles for both passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and large commercial vehicles which plays to our strengths and gives us tremendous opportunities to drive long-term growth with existing customers and the potential to expand our presence and market share especially with commercial vehicle OEMs on a global basis.","Third, we have great smart, dedicated and innovative people who come from a culture and heritage of product and process innovation. We have a great global operating footprint that is well aligned with our customers and market opportunities and yet has the potential to be further optimized in the future.","Fourth, we have a profitable and growing Aftermarket business that not only provides balance to our overall revenue mix, but is on the right path to deliver additional margin and cash flow improvements. The Delphi Technologies brand has great value with Aftermarket customers and end users and it's one of the good surprises I've seen in my first seven weeks here.","And finally, we have a financial model and a balance sheet that gives us the flexibility to deliver profitable long-term growth while investing for the future and returning cash to our shareholders.","However, it's equally clear that we need to do a better job of executing consistently and operating with a greater sense of urgency and discipline to deal with our ongoing challenges which will ultimately support our growth once the transitional headwinds I outlined earlier moderate.","Related to this and as you can see on Slide 3, my immediate priorities are largely focused on improving our execution and driving operational cost efficiencies throughout the company. I will provide further comments during our next earnings call in May and update you on the progress we have made.","It's important to remember that as part of the spin, significant parts of our operations entered into transition and contract manufacturing service agreements with our former parent.","While they were designed to ensure continuity and stability through the first two years after the spin, we will be exiting a number of transition service agreements over the course of 2019, in line with our original timelines and we'll create our own standalone functions in areas such as IT, finance, and HR. This gives us the opportunity to take a clean sheet approach to both improve the efficiency and responsiveness of our organization as well as lowering our overall cost.","I've already started digging deeper into our organization and cost structures to ensure that as we complete our full transition to a standalone company, we are right-sized to support our longer term growth plans.","My initial observations and benchmarking suggest we have some significant opportunities for improvement in several areas of the business. In addition one of my immediate priorities will be ensuring we properly plan, build, staff, and launch our new plants, our new programs, and our new processes flawlessly. We can and we will get much better in these critically important process areas.","While I've been pleased to see some of the actions taken over the course of 2018, I've already spent a good time -- amount of time with Vivid and the teams on identifying the ways we can drive some of these initiatives, most notably to explore options to accelerate the path to profitability in GDi and Power Electronics, ensuring we are able to meet the stronger demand we are seeing from customers across the globe. If appropriate, I will review our organizational structure or bring in new talent to support these initiatives.","More broadly, as part of my initial assessment, I will also focus on ensuring our investments are in areas that have the most attractive long-term potential, while aggressively reducing spend in areas that do not and there's some or both.","Those of you who I've met with or heard me talk or know me from my background know I have a strong operational and manufacturing history. That is a deep-rooted passion and skills that I have owned and refined over the last 25 years and I think quite frankly one of the key reasons that I was chosen for my new role.","To be honest, we talk lean here at Delphi, but we are far from being a lean company in the way we do business. There is real upside for us across our manufacturing footprint, our supply base, and our back offices including admin and technical offices.","While it's still too early to go into specifics, we clearly have opportunities to implement advanced lean manufacturing processes across our global footprint reducing our cost and improving our cash conversion cycle.","So I've covered a lot of grounds since I started in January, and as I'm sure you could tell, I'm excited about the opportunity ahead of us. We have the right strategy based on differentiated portfolio of technologies and capabilities that are squarely positioned to benefit from the strong secular tailwinds that will drive our growth over the long-term. And, we have great momentum with our customers, who rely on our ability and our technical know-how to help them meet regulatory targets and deliver values to their customers.","However, my first weeks as CEO also confirmed the nature and scale of the challenges we face, given the pace of transitions on our industry and the operational improvements we need to make here at Delphi Technologies. That process is already underway, and we will move with the needed urgency to ensure we execute towards our long-term goals of margin expansion, revenue growth and improve our return on invested capital, while creating long-term shareholder value. I look forward to sharing more with you on our first quarter earnings call in three months time.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Vivid.","Vivid Sehgal","Thank you, Rick. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. My remarks will focus on our fourth quarter and full year 2018 performance, our outlook for 2019 and the changes since we provided our preliminary outlook as well as providing additional commentary on how we see our phasing over the course of this year.","Starting with a high level recap of our Q4 and full year financials, which you can see on slide 4. Relative to the outlook we provided three months ago, our Q4 revenue and operating income performance came in essentially in line with our expectations. While adjusted EPS of $1.06 benefited from a lower tax rate, I was pleased with our cash flow performance in the quarter. And on a full year basis, we generated well over $400 million of operating cash flow, which exceeded the top end of our prior outlook range.","As Rick mentioned, 2018 was a record year for us in terms of new business wins with almost $10 billion of awards across our internal combustion engine and our electronics portfolio.","Turning to slide 5. We ended 2018 with a record $9.8 billion of awards compared to $7.1 billion in 2017. Our strong momentum in the marketplace over the last couple of years not only underscores our increasing relevance with customers, but is also a reflection of the investments we have made in key long-term growth technologies for both internal combustion and electrified systems. These gross bookings will over time more than offset certain headwinds impacting our current adjusted revenue growth, such as our shift away from legacy programs, such as passenger car diesel, the evolution of our customer mix in China, as well as ongoing program attrition.","Internal combustion engine technologies accounted for approximately half of our new business wins in 2018, which included our largest ever GDi program with a major European OEM for our industry-leading 350 bar system. In addition, we secured our largest GDi booking in North America with a major OEM.","The other half wins were driven by electronics and electrification portfolio, where our differentiated technologies including systems and software expertise continue to help us win in the marketplace. Over the course of 2018, we secured more than $3 billion of Power Electronics wins balanced across customers and regions, including multiple wins for our inverter and our combined inverter and DC to DC converter solutions. We expect 2019 to be another year of strong new business wins.","Turning to slide 6. Looking at our Q4 performance in a bit more detail. Revenue of just below $1.2 billion in the quarter declined by 4.7% year-on-year versus an overall market decline of approximately 6%.","Driving the revenue performance in Q4 was strong growth in Power Electronics and Commercial Vehicle, which was offset by lower GDi sales in China and to a lesser extent by impacts related to passenger car diesel and WLTP in Europe. Adjusted operating income of $125 million or 10.7% margin declined by 30 basis points year-on-year.","EPS of $1.06 benefited from a lower than expected tax rate, which resulted in an approximate $0.10 uplift in EPS for the quarter the lower tax expense primarily related to the timing of ongoing tax optimization initiatives.","During the fourth quarter, we took actions to offset some of the incremental softness we saw most notably in China and I was pleased with our cash flow performance. Operating cash flow of $126 million in the quarter was helped by improvement in our working capital performance as we ended the year with a strength in balance sheet.","Turning to slide 7, which provides more detail on our revenue progression in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong growth in two key areas of the portfolio. Power Electronics revenues increased by approximately 30% in Q4 versus prior year, and in Commercial Vehicle, revenues increased by approximately 25%.","GDi revenues declined by approximately 10% in the quarter, primarily related to low revenues in China, the impact of WLTP in Europe and a high year-on-year comparison from the prior year quarter when GDi revenues grew by more than 40%.","As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide from a total company perspective, we outgrew the market in all regions with the exception of China. Revenue in Europe increased by 3% as growth in commercial vehicle and GDi was offset by the ongoing decline in passenger car diesel revenues.","In North America, revenue growth of 6% was primarily driven by higher sales to Commercial Vehicle customers as well as new program launches. Finally, our sales in China declined by 24%, driven by the combination of incremental market softness as well as our own customer mix.","Slide eight walks you through our operating income growth for Q4. Adjusted operating income was $125 million, down from $140 million in the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by contractual price-downs, unfavorable mix, lower industry production, higher engineering spend to support future growth, and to a lesser extent higher commodity and tariff-related costs.","This was partially offset by ongoing improvements in material performance, lower incentive accruals, and overall cost control including lower spin-related costs. In addition adjusted operating income included the forfeiture of stock-based compensation related to our former CEO, which we had incorporated into our previous outlook.","Turning to our segment performance on the next slide. Year-on-year basis, Powertrain Systems adjusted revenue declined by 6% in the quarter as strong growth in Power Electronics and Commercial Vehicle was offset by lower revenues in passenger car diesel softness in GDi China and the impact of WLTP.","Adjusted operating margin of 9.7% was down 140 basis points year-on-year primarily due to unfavorable mix and incremental engineering spend to support long-term growth.","In addition, margin was impacted by higher commodity and tariff-related costs, which were partially offset by ongoing improvement in operational performance as well as overall cost control.","Turning to our aftermarket segment on slide 10. Our Q4 aftermarket performance continued the trend we have seen throughout the year. Revenue of $225 million increased by 3% on an adjusted basis as higher sales to independent aftermarket customers more than offset lower sales through the OES channel. Adjusted operating margin expanded by 480 basis points year-on-year, driven by commercial strategy and operational performance. In addition, the aftermarket segment has continued to deliver improved operating cash flow through the combination of higher earnings and our focus on improving working capital.","Now let's move on to our outlook for 2019. Slide 11 outlines our outlook for the year. At a high level, we expect 2019 to be a transitional year with an acceleration of our own mix dynamics as well as continued macro industry headwinds. Starting with revenue. For the full year, we expect revenue to be between $4.65 billion and $4.75 billion or a 1% to 3% decline in the adjusted growth rate compared to 2018. This assumes an approximate 2% decline in global production in 2019.","Full year adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 9% with earnings per share in the range of $3 to $3.20. Note that our EPS outlook does not reflect any impact from share repurchases. On the right-hand side of the slide, we have laid out other important outlook metrics. Restructuring charges are expected to be in the $25 million to $35 million range; onetime separation cost in the range of $45 million to $50 million; and we've assumed an adjusted tax rate of approximately 18%.","Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow is expected to be in the range of $320 million to $350 million and Slide 18 in the appendix provides a more detailed walk of our expected year-on-year performance. On our previous call, I've referenced our plan to review our future pension provision to our U.K. workforce. Since then we have made good progress and our cash contribution in 2019 is expected to increase by approximately $30 million to $35 million to both mitigate the future pension liabilities and address current funding requirements. Total pension cash contributions are therefore expected to be approximately $80 million for the year, given the $30 million to $35 million of incremental cost.","Turning to CapEx, which we expect to be in the range of $310 million to $330 million. This includes approximately $30 million of onetime separation CapEx as we complete our full transition to becoming a standalone company. Slide 12 takes you through some of the key functions behind our revenue outlook for the year. Starting on the left-hand side of the slide, you can see the assumptions that bridge our 2018 revenues to the preliminary outlook for 2019 I provided last quarter.","At a high level, the 1% to 2% revenue growth assumed approximately 6% underlying performance. This was offset by an approximate 300 basis point headwind from the decline in passenger car diesel revenue and an approximate 150 basis point headwind from price-downs. Global production was assumed to be approximately flat.","Moving to the right hand bars on the slide. We now assume that global production will decline by approximately 2%. In addition, we have adjusted our assumptions on certain programs and launches in China and North America, based on revised customer schedules and our own more conservative view on our launches, particularly on the ramp of GDi in China.","On the right hand side of the slide, we have provided some of the key drivers behind our revenue growth expectations for 2019. As mentioned, we continue to expect strong growth in our key technologies.","Specifically, we expect to see another year of accelerated growth in Power Electronics with more than 50% growth in 2019. For GDi, we expect more than 10% growth, driven by new 350 bar launches and ramps in Europe and China and high single-digit growth in commercial vehicles.","On China, we expect our revenue growth to decline in the mid-single-digit range in 2019, a significant change from our preliminary outlook. Our revised China outlook assumes a continuation of the weakness with local OEM customers, particularly in the first half of the year, offset by new GDi and Power Electronics launches, which were expected to accelerate in the back half of the year.","Turning to the next slide. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, we expect the headwinds we saw in the second half of 2018 to continue into 2019. Slide 13 walks through the drivers of our operating margin outlook. Relative to the 11.3% for full year 2018, you can see the major puts and takes that get you to the approximate 9% margin in 2019.","Starting from the left, you can see the impact from lower volumes and unfavorable mix, which is primarily due to the combination of accelerated declines in the higher-margin passenger car diesel revenues and the expected acceleration in growth from the lower-margin Power Electronics and GDi revenues I referenced earlier. Price-downs are expected again to be in the 150 basis points range.","Offsetting this is an expected 300 basis points of margin improvement, driven by material and manufacturing performance, the continued margin expansion from the aftermarket business, as well as ongoing SG&A initiatives.","Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately a 60 basis point year-on-year headwind, driven by the elevated levels of CapEx in 2018 versus the prior year. Finally, there is an expected 60 basis point impact from the combination of FX headwinds and the impact of high commodity and tariff costs.","While, our expected margin performance in 2019 is clearly not at the levels we are happy with, this bridge does highlight the magnitude of some of the key transitional headwinds, particularly in our mix that we expect to lessen as we look out beyond this year.","While, we are not providing a specific quarterly EPS outlook for 2019, I wanted to spend a few minutes to provide some color on how we see our phasing through the year. Slide 14 outlines some of the key dynamics for the first quarter.","From a year-on-year adjusted revenue growth and EPS perspective, we expect Q1 to be the lightest quarter of the year. Starting with revenues, we expect mid- to high single-digit year-on-year adjusted revenue decline, primarily driven by the combination of global production softness as well as inventory reductions with some of our customers in China. We expect year-on-year global production to decline by approximately 5% in Q1 and approximately 2% sequentially.","Turning to the adjusted operating margin which you can see on slide 14. For Q1 in addition to the lower seasonal revenues, there are a couple of specific drivers that I wanted to call out that are expected to result in a stronger sequential decline in our margin performance relative to the fourth quarter of 2018.","First, there is the absence of the benefit we saw in Q4 from the forfeiture of our former CEO's compensation and lower incentive accruals; and second the timing impact from annual contractual price-downs. Which predominantly take effect on January 1. The combined impact of these two drivers is expected to be more than 300 basis points sequential headwind to margin.","Layering in a couple of smaller drivers related to commodities, foreign exchange and tariffs, we expect our Q1 adjusted operating margin to be approximately 7%. For the balance of 2019 and consistent with our full year outlook, we expect our adjusted operating margin performance to improve particularly in the second half of the year and on slide 15 you can see why.","Our first half outlook assumes an adjusted operating margin in the 7% to 8% range building off the Q1 base. And while we expect to see some sequential margin improvement in Q2, there are a number of drivers behind the stronger margin performance we expect to deliver in the second half of the year. From a volume perspective, we expect to see stronger growth in the second half of the year given the phasing of our launch activity, which we expect will more than offset seasonally lower production levels.","Specifically for GDi and Power Electronics, we have a number of new launches that are expected to accelerate into the second half. This is also expected to support their improved profitability in the back half of the year as we see and gain greater scale and start to realize some of the operational benefits, particularly for GDi from the actions we are taking. In addition, we expect aftermarket business to show stronger margin progression in the second half.","From a cost perspective, we have a couple of important dynamics to support our H2 margin improvement: first the phasing of our engineering spend is more first-half weighted; and second we expect to see lower spin-related cost as we exit a number of our transition service agreements starting in Q2 and eliminate duplicate costs. This is expected to more than offset higher second half depreciation charges.","So in closing and before we take your questions, our Q4 performance was essentially in line with our outlook and we ended the year with a strengthened balance sheet. Given the softer growth we see in 2019, my focus which is aligned with Rick will remain on cost control and operating cash generation while continuing to invest to support our longer-term growth.","With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rick Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your may proceed.","Rick Kwas","Hi, good morning everyone.","Rick Dauch","Good morning, Rick.","Vivid Sehgal","Good morning, Rick.","Rick Dauch","Hey, really appreciate it.","Rick Kwas","Thanks. So just on China just a little more granularity. So you've got it down 8% overall. Within -- do you have a number with regards to your top local customers or your top 10 platforms there that we can reference as we think about the year?","Vivid Sehgal","Yes. It's Vivid here. So the way to think about it is in a couple of ways. If I provide you some granular detail the existing business that we have in China is down about 8 -- about 20% in total and the launches are going to be generating around about a 15% driver. That's how we sort of get to our own mid-single-digit driver on this.","I think the key color is that the local OEMs where we saw particularly second half softness in 2018, we expect them to be down about 20% again in 2019. The good news is that the launches that we have in the 350 bar in the Power Electronics are mostly with the Tier I and the global JVs which we are definitely seeing a mix awards and that gives us some comfort that the transitional headwinds in 2019 will start moderating out into the future.","Rich Kwas","All right. Okay. Thanks Vivid. And then just on the launch. So as the programs that you're either have launched here recently or about to launch, what's the assumption around profitability for this?","Because obviously the second half implies a pretty hefty ramp in the margin and the launch activity is helping that. Usually in the first year of a launch there's typically some startup cost that sits. You don't get the full volume out for a couple of quarters. How should we think about what's embedded in terms of the contingency around the launch profitability?","A - Vivid Sehgal","So we expect - I mean if you think about our margin expansion into the second half of the year, it's fundamentally coming from a number of areas and I'll touch it on the margin of GDi and Power Electronics in a minute.","But fundamentally, our margins as we progress through the year are going to come from performance. We do have some decent manufacturing material performance uplift in the second half. We certainly see engineering spend in the second half being lower. We definitely see aftermarket expansion in the second half. You've already seen 490 basis points. We expect some very decent margin expansion in the second half.","And that will offset a lot of these sort of expected higher depreciation charges. I think the way we're looking at it right now is that, we've baked in some assumptions. A lot of the capacity and the depreciation that we put in place right now, we did see some of the impacts of that already in the second half of 2018 and we're going to see some downside in 2019.","So we're pretty confident right now that through two areas and I think Rick sort of touched upon one of them is, the margin expansion is going to come from factory margin improvement also reduction in the premium freight that we talked about previously, but also some reduction in the just general install base capacity and the tos-and-fros that we've seen recently from China and Europe.","So there is going to be a ramp from factory but there's going to be also a ramp from -- in margin from the sort of what I call the operational issues that we faced in 2018.","Rick Dauch","Yes. Rich. This is Rick. I've only been to two or three of the GDi plants so far. I guess I've been with three of them. So they are going -- the equipment is installed. They're going through the typical launch debugging in terms of roll throughput first-time quality and scrap.","We have a couple of operations that are causing us some heartaches. And so one of the things -- it's good learning for me to find out if we have common processes across these three plants for an example an injector, are we having the same issues on a welding process? If not, why not? If we are what are we doing to fix those kinds of things?","So those are all operating opportunities to improve the business. In one of our plants our first-time quality is only around 80%. That means we're repairing 20% or scrapping 20%. So that low-hanging fruit to go after, okay?","The second is we're spending a lot of money right now to tool up and build these three plants. We're -- we've built the buildings. We're -- we bought the equipment. The equipment is being run off. That supply is going to be installed here in the first half of the year for Reynosa, for Bologna, for Poland and over in China. I think it's Suzhou. We've already had to hire the people to go through the training. We had to travel -- people traveled to our existing sites to learn how to make these kind of parts.","So those are kind of abnormal one-time costs to get the business ready to go on launch. And we're in the process of consolidating the plant in Sudbury, U.K. and it's being split in half -- they're actually being split in a third. A part of it is going to \u0130zmir, Turkey. Part of it's going to Ia\u0219i Romania. And a part of it's going to Stonehouse, England. So those are costs to move equipment and tool up and train people as well.","So we have a lot of that going on as part of the one the spin; and two part of the consolidation of our footprint.","Rich Kwas","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Appreciate it.","Rick Dauch","Great question.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy","Good morning, guys.","Rick Dauch","Hey, John.","John Murphy","Just wanted to sort of follow-up on the slide on the regional breakout. And I'm just curious if you look at China, is there anything changing in the way that the bid process is going on with the locals and in the international? Because it seems like the other performance there was somewhat explained. But it just seemed like there might be something else going on. And also as we think about the backlog ramping up, I'm just curious if you can give us a sort of a better understanding of the regional breakout of that backlog and maybe the customers that are in that backlog. I know you sort of said 50-50 ICE EV, but just wanted to understand the customers as well as geography in that backlog.","Vivid Sehgal ","Yes. Hi, John, Vivid here. Maybe I'll take that first. I mean, certainly from the local OEM customers, I mean, the key thing to remember, is a lot of the local OEMs is some of the older GDi technology and component sales in the 200 bar. And a lot of these customers we have not taken any incremental new business wins over the last couple of years at least. Our focus in China has been predominantly within the Tier 1 the global JV.","So what we're seeing is the acceleration and the regulatory tightening in CN5 CN6 is coming. But some of the older PFI, GDi and component sales are naturally falling away. What's fundamentally happened is that the market softness had just made that acceleration a lot quicker than we expected.","So nothing fundamentally is going on there. And just on the business wins that we have in place, we continue to have a very rigorous approach to looking at this and working with management, working with the board. We look very carefully at the haircuts on volumes. And if you do take China volumes, we will take haircuts appropriately, given some of the softness. We do look at our ROIC, return on invested capitals pretty much. And we do actually have regional variations to some of the discount rates that we take.","So nothing fundamentally is going on in the Chinese local OEMs. We always expected them to transition off. It's just happened a lot quicker than we expected.","In terms of the business wins, just to try and give you a bit more color, yes, certainly, if you look at it all together even more specifics Power Electronics in 2018 was about a third of the business wins. GDi was about 40%. And the remainder was some commercial vehicle and other businesses that we have.","And in terms of sort of more geographic mix there, around Europe and Asia we're pretty much even at about 35% to 40% of the wins, and North America was in the 20% to 25% of new business wins. So, hopefully, that's given you some color on the booking side of our business.","John Murphy","Any customer concentration there? Or is it fairly diverse?","Vivid Sehgal","It's pretty diverse. I mean, we are -- in the China side it is predominately, like I said, in the Tier 1 and the global JVs. The rest of it across Europe and in North America is diverse. There's no specific customer. But we did talk about one customer in Europe, particularly a new customer. We're not going to get into the details right now, but it's pretty diverse.","John Murphy","Yeah.","Rick Dauch","John, it's Rick. I haven't been over to Asia yet. I'm going there early March. But obviously, there's going to be some -- the downturn over in China for the last eight months is going to shake out some of the weaker players. I think the Chinese government probably wants that to happen. There's too many players over there in the regional and so, we'll see what we do. I've asked our team to kind of show me where we're exposed and where we're not exposed in there.","I was pleasantly surprised that we have a very strong relation on our commercial vehicle business with the Volvo Group which includes Volvo Mack and the Renault buses. And now we're going to grow with Dongfeng as part of their joint venture with Volvo to start bringing some of our products over there as well. So, that's good. That truck market, as you know, is 1 million trucks over in China. We have barely a small piece of it right now, so that's good.","John Murphy","Rick -- and if I could sneak one more in here. Just as we think about your review here, I understand that you're still working through the details and visiting plants. But in your early days and obviously your long experience in the industry, do you think there is ultimately the need for greater consolidation in scale in the powertrain business, both existing on ICE and EVs over time? And is that sort of part of the thought process here as to what the shape and size and scale of Delphi ultimately will be over time and there might be M&A, there might be other kind of combinations that come down the line that might make sense?","Rick Dauch","Let me answer that question a couple of ways. I would say before I joined the company, I took a broad look at the industry. And I do feel there'll be some consolidation of the supply base down the road. How that's going to play out, I don't know. Since I've taken over, I pick -- put that in the back burner right now. I told the board let me focus 100% of my time on learning my team, like I said our people, our products, our processes and that's what I'm focused on right now.","I'm sure there's opportunities out there down the road, but we need to drive the value of this company up where it needs to be. And I see all kinds of low hanging fruit to get after here in our company, right?","Two things I'd say. I'm a little bit surprised for a company that's been around for well over 100 years and been part of the Delphi Automotive Group that there's some fundamental missing pieces in the way we do our business, specifically on program launches and lean manufacturing. We are far from world-class in that area, okay? So, that's not bad news to me. That's good news to me. That means we can improve, because we already have a good business. We can make it much better, right?","So, I've got to teach people a few things here and probably make a few changes from a structure standpoint or some specific people to bring in to help us teach that step that we can get after pretty quick. And it takes 18, 24 months to get that job done. So, okay?","John Murphy","Great. We are looking forward to it. Thank you very much.","Rick Dauch","Great, John. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi, everybody.","Rick Dauch","Hi, Emmanuel.","Vivid Sehgal","Hi, Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner","So first question is on your slide 15 and the expectation of material improvement in margin profile second half versus first half. So you detailed some of the drivers on the side. And so if I had to summarize them, seems like some of them are a sort of timing related so either launches in the second half or extra cost in the first half. And some of them are operational improvements and performance related.","And any way you can sort of dimension that for us? And what essentially needs to happen on the operational side, specifically between now and then for you to be able to achieve that? Because you obviously started the call saying that you have hard tough work ahead of you.","So, maybe just as related to 2019, what needs to happen for the second half margin to be delivered?","Rick Dauch","Let me make a few comments and I'll let Vivid get into more detail. So, first of all, we have -- right now we have four launches under way for our GDi product; one, in France for injectors; one, in Bologna that's been going on for about six months on injectors; one in China on injectors and fuel pumps; and then one in Romania on fuel pumps. None of those launches are at the levels of performance that we expect them to be and that's just hard-core manufacturing 101 and supply chain management 101.","So whenever you launch that kind of sophisticated equipment, it's always difficult to work out the bugs. You're talking a lot of automation, some very tight tolerances and very tight tooling. But when you couple that with the industry's panic on the move from diesel to gas and they need more products well then now you're running six or seven days a week, right? That causes inefficiency both in your plants and you have no recovery time. And whatever you lose then you lose in your supply base as well. And so that's some of the inefficiencies. We have to get our hands on top of that and get all our operations running well and make sure our supply chains too.","We've had these discussions all the way back to the customer who didn't tool the supply base or our suppliers fast enough to make this shift. And so they're having some good discussions around that. That's number one.","Two, as I said earlier, building a plant from the ground up, staffing them, training them, putting equipment in, making the mistake to do that that's on the electronic side of the business we've got to get that behind us too. That's going to take us the full 2019 and into 2020. Those plants are just starting up basically in the late first half, early second half of this year, okay. So that's a couple of things there, okay. Is that fair?","Emmanuel Rosner","Yeah, absolutely. Would love some color from Vivid around, okay, to put some numbers on it going from 7%, 8% to 10%, 11% margin. How much is like timing versus operational improvement?","Vivid Sehgal","Sure. Well, if I \u2013 Emmanuel, if I look at the -- let me give you, maybe the bucket list of the highest priorities in terms of what really drives it and then I can add some color around timing issues.","Probably and I think the most top two important ones are really around the SG&A and standalone cost opportunities we have and the improvements in the material and manufacturing processes that we have.","The first thing to think about really is that we are exiting a lot of our TSAs with our parent company in the second half of this year, and as part of that there's going to be a natural reduction in the transition service agreements. You're aware that we have markups right now. You're aware that we've been incurring duplicate costs in the company. And in the second half of the year, which is pretty visible to us right now that will naturally roll off. So we're pretty confident on that one.","The next one I'd bring to your attention is around the performance on manufacturing and materials. Again last year certainly materials we proved to be in good shape in terms of the opportunities. And manufacturing was certainly an area that we did not hit our targets on.","So again I think we will naturally have improvements in manufacturing as Rick said. He's been to the plants and we are definitely scaling out. So I think that's the next one to think about.","I think the next one after that is to think about is the Aftermarket expansion. The Aftermarket team has done an absolutely superb job in relation to their margin improvement profile, particularly on the supply chain, looking at pricing across the organization. And we see that as a continued benefit to the company in the second half. And again we have very detailed plans of how to get that.","Then I'll probably bring in the incremental GDi and Power Electronics margins as the next component of that. I think as Rick said, the good news for us is we have opportunities. What we're not doing is betting our house right now on GDi and Power Electronics as being the major drivers of second half operating performance. That's certainly not what we're doing at this point in time. We have enough in our tank on cost engineering spend and other areas that we think we can basically take out of this business to drive our performance. I hope that's given you some color.","A \u2013 Rick Dauch","Yes. Let me give a follow-up there too. I spent the last week with the aftermarket team. First and foremost, I was surprised at the diversity of the team and the newness of the team. Majority of the senior leadership of our aftermarket team had only been here two years or less. So they're still gelling as a team. And the job they did in the back half of last year was tremendous. The amount of money they collected from a cash flow basis in the fourth quarter was great both from an AR standpoint and from an inventory reduction standpoint. And after two days of working with them, I think we'd grow that business even faster than we think we can right now right? That's an upside opportunity for sure.","I didn't really quite understand all the 71 different spin combinations we have going on our TSAs. The good news is we're on track. The bad news is some of it are a little bit over. And once they're done though, we'll get rid of those costs. You got extra consultants in here helping us. You got -- as Vivid said, we have to stand up our own IT office in Hungary -- Romania, right? We're standing up our own back office area in Poland and so all that takes time and money to go recruit people and that kind of stuff. So it will be great to get completely stood up 100% of our own and we can control our own destiny.","We still have some operational issues that we're -- disrupting us, tied to the spin and we're on track to get that behind us by the end of the year as well. So getting to be a true standalone company, we have control over all of our destiny going forward is a good thing. And I think I told you guys, when I was in Vegas and you were there at American Axle when we left General Motors, we had three years before we became a public traded company. All that ugly work to stand up a company from nothing was done in private. Here we've been doing it since day one on December 4 as a publicly traded company. And we paid for that dearly last year okay?","Q \u2013 Emmanuel Rosner","Yes. It's great color. And just I guess my follow-up then is still on the margin side. To what extent is your second half margin a good run rate as you look beyond this year? So is 10%, 11% a sort of like sustainable level to build upon? Or should we think about it differently?","A \u2013 Vivid Sehgal","I think it's -- that's a good question. I think if you look at the drivers of margin, the way that I've looked at this Emmanuel is that if you look at the second half of 2018, you can pretty much begin to proxy the first half of 2019. As we start exiting the TSA, so looking at the second half of 2019 should set some degree the momentum and direction of how '20 should look. So we're not going to give '20 any type of medium-term framework.","But if I was going to give you some financial guardrails right now, certainly as we come off the TSAs, as we see GDi Power Electronics improvements, as we see some of the performance coming through and I think with Rick being on board that's going to give us even greater opportunities to expand our opportunities right now. Certainly the second half I think as we exit the year will put us in certainly a better position in the first half undoubtedly.","A \u2013 Rick Dauch","Yes. That will be on a very tight leash Emmanuel, right? But I'd say after seven weeks as I've said in my opening comments, I'm extremely bullish about the opportunities here, okay? There are things we can get after. It'll take some time to do so, but I think we can do quite well. That's all I'd say. How is that? You can put me on a tight string. I can't give you any numbers all right?","Emmanuel Rosner","Thank you.","Rick Dauch","Okay. Cheers.","Operator","And our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. You may proceed.","Colin Langan","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just firstly, can you just remind us about the tariff headwinds from China that you incurred in 2018? And what sort of baked in, let's say, on the 40 basis points for commodity and tariffs? Is that all pretty much tariff? I'm trying to gauge if things actually got better. What maybe is that going to be?","Vivid Sehgal","No. Hi, Colin. So let me start with 2019. So for 2019, the combination of tariffs and commodity is around about $20 million in total. And that's split pretty evenly between tariff and commodity exposure.","Off the tariff, we have assumed a list three. It does come into play starting in March of 2019. And if list three does not come in at the 25% and comes more in the 10% range, we think that the total exposure will be more like $5 million, rather than the $10 million we are seeing right now.","Colin Langan","Got it. And was there any hit this year there? Or...","Vivid Sehgal","Yes. In 2000 -- yes, there was. Yes, there was. So the combination. I've sort of given ranges in the past. So the combination on the tariff side was predominantly the second half performance was in the $3 million to $4 million.","Colin Langan","Okay. Got it. And just secondly, CapEx guidance up quite dramatically from where you were in 2016. I mean is that -- I think you're like $170 million then, and now in the $300 million. I mean is that related to some of the issues you have on things like GDi that maybe you didn't invest early enough? I mean -- and is that causing some of the capacity constraints and overtime today? Or is that a misunderstanding? Or is this all just for the future EV launches?","Vivid Sehgal","No. I think the way to think about it, I think you're right to a degree. The first and probably the most important thing that there is going to be in the region of about $80 million to $100 million of one-time CapEx that is going to be part of 2018 and 2019.","As Rick said, we're building our plants. We're expanding up our IT facilities. And I've always given the guidance of about $80 million to $100 million. So if you take that number, I talked about one-time CapEx in 2019, that's like 0.5 point in relation to our CapEx percentage of sales, quite significant for us.","The second one is definitely to do with your point, which is about future revenue generation and the bookings momentum that we have in place right now. We have actually increased new business wins to a good material degree, up sort of 35% in 2018 versus 2017. We're relatively confident that we can carry on.","So I think if you look at our CapEx, it is broken down probably into three parts. Number one is capacity for growth, which represents about 70% of our normal CapEx. The second portion of that will be the one-time nature of the $80 million to $100 million. And then the third element is, definitely to a lesser degree what you talked about, which is a catch-up in relation to putting more installed capacity, particularly into Europe to deal with our potential GDi issues.","Rick Dauch","Yes. Three plants we're building, that's not normal. GDi's capacities. It's one customer alone that asked us to go from capacity of 10,000 engines a week to 30,000 engines a week. That drives capital. That's growth capital. The plant closure of Sudbury, we have to move that equipment or replace older equipment and then put some of the basic infrastructure in place from an IT standpoint.","So normal Tier 1 automotive companies, if they're steady state are somewhere between 3.5%, 4% of CapEx that will be back to your $180 million, $200 million CapEx number on a $5 billion company. And we're spending a little bit higher than that right now because of all the growth we have going on in the transition.","Vivid Sehgal","Yes. And to be fair I think Rick made a great point. I think if you strip out one-time CapEx out of 2017 our CapEx number is more sort of in the region of about 4.5%. Certainly this year it's elevated but that's largely driven by the coming off of the factory builds and the IT cost that we're building out right now and the capacity required for our revenue expansion in new bookings wins. So, it's certainly elevated, but the reason behind it is growth.","Rick Dauch","And Colin I'd say -- I'm still getting my hands around that as the new CEO and one of the dynamics -- it's not often you're in a business that's growing at a CAGR of 30% to 40% and that's really being driven by the hybridization electrification of the industry across the Board.","VW is spending $25 billion on X number of platforms for electric vehicles. General Motors is spending multi-billion dollars for electric vehicles. So, if you want to be a player, you've got to put the capacity in place, right? And so those are kind of things we're doing right now whether that's an inverter, converter, capacitors, chargers and that kind of stuff like that. So, that's the big driver of our capital right now as well.","Colin Langan","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Rick Dauch","Thanks Tom.","Vivid Sehgal","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may proceed.","James Picariello","Hey good morning guys. Can we just get the breakdown in the quarter related to bookings? Previously obviously you've provided the breakout between Commercial Vehicle, GDi, Power Electronics. You obviously talked about qualitative the color on GDi win in Europe, demand for Power Electronics. But can you -- are you willing to quantify that breakout?","Vivid Sehgal","Yes, we normally give that number by the year. So, we have provided that which -- the trends are pretty consistent throughout the year so about 30% Power Electronics for the year, about 40% GDi, and the remainder a combination of Commercial Vehicle and our Other businesses.","So, sort of bookings can be up and down, but that's the sort of target that we normally give as an annualized number which we're very pleased with because I think that walk -- that does show is that the growth in our key technologies we're reporting most of our engineering and our CapEx right now and where we think this business is going to go forward is exactly in the right places and with quality customers as well. I don't know Rick if you want to add anything more.","Rick Dauch","Yes. I've been able to have many face-to-face with four of our largest customers, three of them on the passenger car side, one of them on the truck side. The real positive thing as one said to us, we need you Delphi Technologies. One of the European-based companies said, we didn\u2019t have a plan to shift this quickly from diesel to gas and we need you to come with us as fast as you can.","A second one said to me, the move to hybrids and electrics is faster than we thought. And we aren't experts on the electronic side of the house. You guys are. You're one of the leaders in the industry. What can you do to help us? And so that's positive.","On the truck side, as you know the North American truck market is still super-hot. The capacities are very constrained. We're running basically flat out seven days a week. The good news I found out when I got here is one of our big customers authorized us late last year to put in about $16 million of CapEx for more capacity. That capacity is supposed to come online in the second quarter. They recently asked me if we can pull that ahead into the first quarter. We're going to do everything we can to, but that tells you how the demand is. The customers are pulling Delphi Technologies products to them. We're not having to push our technologies onto them. That's a great position to be as a supplier.","James Picariello","And that's very helpful. Just on the separation cost, the additional separation cost for 2019 was that quantified at $31 million? Did I hear that correctly? And how does that compare to your prior 2019 guidance? Thanks.","Vivid Sehgal","So the -- so there's two separations cost that we incurred. The first one is a CapEx cost which will be in the number that I just quoted there. But there's also some OpEx that's in there and that will be significantly lower than 2018. So I gave a number of 2018 the separation OpEx cost would be in that sort of $70 million to $80 million. And you can expect that number to be relatively halved in terms of 2019. So there is CapEx which is significantly lower from a roundabout $50 million to $60 million in 2018 to the $30-odd million that I've spoken about now. And OpEx separation onetime is coming down from $70 million to $80 million and it's about half of that in 2019.","A \u2013 Rick Dauch","Yes. And I gave a -- two weeks ago I gave our leader of our electronics business a task. I said, hey come back to me and Vivid and tell me what you need from us to pull everything ahead by a quarter or two if you can. Can you get your equipment sooner? Can you finish the construction of your plant sooner? That means, I've got to pay some premiums on Saturdays and Sundays to have a supplier build equipment or built -- or have a construction guy build the plant because the sooner we can have our own plant stand up and we're not tied to our ex parent company from a supplier standpoint the better off we are. That's an irritant for us right now. So...","James Picariello","Thanks, guys.","A \u2013 Rick Dauch","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes our Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rick Dauch for any closing remarks.","Rick Dauch","Thank you very much. Well thank you everybody for joining us today on the call. I look forward to updating you again in the future after our earnings call in the -- after the first quarter. And I'm going to leave here tonight to head down to the aftermarket meeting in Spain. And then I'm off back to North America next week to see all of our plants in U.S. and Mexico. And so my orientation continues. Thanks for your investment and thanks for your interest in Delphi Technologies. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Delphi Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jessica Holscott, Delphi's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jessica, you may now begin your conference.","Jessica L. Holscott","Thank you, Tony, and thanks for joining Delphi's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. To follow along with today's presentation, our slides can be found at delphi.com under the Investors section of the website. Please see Slide 2 for a disclosure on forward-looking statements, which we'll be making on today's call and only reflect Delphi's current view of future financial performance, which may be materially different from our actual performance.","Joining today's call will be Rod O'Neal, Delphi's CEO and President; and Kevin Clark, our CFO. As seen on Slide 3, Rod will begin the call with an overview of our fourth quarter, followed by Kevin, who will review our financial results in greater detail, discuss our 2014 outlook, and then after Rod's concluding comments, we'll open the line up for Q&A. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Rod.","Rodney O'Neal","Thank you, Jessica. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us. We had a record fourth quarter and finished the year extremely strong. In fact, when you look at what Delphi has accomplished in the last year, it's further proof that our company remains laser-focused on delivering value to our customers and to our shareholders.","Move to Slide 5, please. We capped off 2013 with a record fourth quarter. Revenues were up 11%. EBITDA margins expanded 170 basis points and the EPS grew 24%. For the year, Delphi's revenues were $16.5 billion, up 6%. Our earnings per share increased 15%. So in summary, 2013 was a great year.","We're very optimistic that we will achieve double-digit EPS growth in 2014. We continue to maintain a disciplined focus on capital allocation. Our Board recently approved $1 billion share repurchase plan and increased our annual dividend payout from $0.68 to $1 per share. And we will continue to invest in our game-changing Safe, Green and Connected portfolio.","So Delphi has a lot to be excited about, and I am extremely proud of our continued strong results. It's a testament to Delphi's focus on technologies that our customers want and the markets are demanding. And because of that, we're well-positioned for growth and profitability.","Slide 6. You've heard me say this before, but there's no better technology showcase than the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Automotive has become one of the top attractions at CES. All of the OEs were there. And I had a chance to meet with our customers and several of our partners, like Tesla, Intel, NVIDIA and Apple.","Slide 7. The week after CES, I and my team met with the top leadership of our customers at the 2014 North American International Auto Show. This year's show had the highest attendance in 10 years, a sign of positive momentum we're seeing in the North American industry.","Let's go to Slide 8. Delphi continues to focus on solving our customers' problems, and we will continue to invest in innovation for the future. This year, we will invest close to $1.7 billion in engineering and development, and plan to increase the number of engineers to 20,000. And as further proof that our technology investments continue to hit the mark, Delphi has 3 technologies that are finalists for the prestigious Automotive News PACE Award this year. We've already won 16 PACE Awards, more than any other company. And these awards are validation of both our advanced technologies and our operational excellence. And in 2014, our technologies will continue to wow the marketplace.","Slide 9. We had a record fourth quarter of $8 billion in new business bookings that included an award for Ford for global safety electronics and a BAIC Mercedes award for wiring in China. And as you can see, we continue to diversify the regional mix of our revenue.","Let's go to Slide 10. Our priorities are very simple, and they remain unchanged. All are focused on increasing shareholder value through disciplined revenue growth, optimizing our footprint, accelerating the introduction of advanced technologies, expanding margins, increasing earnings per share and deploying capital in a very disciplined manner.","With that, I'll turn over the call to Kevin to cover the numbers. Kevin?","Kevin P. Clark","Thanks, Rod. Good morning, everybody. I'll begin by covering our fourth quarter results, and then discuss full year and first quarter guidance.","Consistent with our prior earnings call, today's discussions will exclude all restructuring and other nonrecurring costs to provide clear visibility into the underlying performance of the business. For your reference, the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are included at the back of both the press release as well as this presentation.","So let me start on Slide 12 with a snapshot of our fourth quarter financial performance. As Rod already mentioned, we were very pleased with our results, which reflected strong underlying markets, especially in China and North America, and continued very solid operating performance. The net result was strong revenue, strong earnings and cash flow growth. However, we remain cautious about the macros in Europe and have concerns about the current environment in South America, which I'll touch on later in the presentation.","Revenue totaled $4.2 billion, that's up 11% for the quarter. Adjusting for the effects of FX, commodity prices and acquisitions, revenues increased 8%. That's roughly 4 points over our underlying market.","EBITDA increased almost 26% to $611 million, and EBITDA margins expanded 170 basis points to 14.6%. Operating income reached $472 million, and operating margins expanded to 11.3%. That's 190 basis point year-over-year increase.","Net income totaled $345 million, and earnings per share increased, as Rod said, over 24% to $1.12.","Lastly, cash flow totaled $520 million. So with that as the backdrop, move to Slide 13, and I'll review revenue in greater detail.","As I mentioned, revenue increased over $400 million, or 11%, to just under $4.2 billion during the quarter. Price down to 1.6% and lower copper pricing pass-throughs presented a combined $78 million, or almost a 2-point headwind to year-over-year growth. FX added $55 million to revenues and over 1 point to our growth rate. Volume totaled $369 million, adding 10 points of growth. And the MVL acquisition, which we closed on in late October of 2012, added roughly $70 million of revenue or 2 points to our growth rate.","On a regional basis, European revenues were up 7%, primarily the result of easier year-over-year comps. If you recall, in the fourth quarter of 2012, the European market was very weak, and our revenues were down over 18%. However, during the quarter, we did benefit from the ongoing improvement in the underlying market, especially during the month of December. But as I mentioned, we remain cautious about the pace of this improving trend.","North American revenues increased roughly 9%, reflecting very strong December production schedules, partially driven by the transition to the K2XX platform. Asia continued to be our fastest-growing region. Revenues increased over 14%. China revenues actually increased 17%, and were actually up over 20% in the month of December alone, driven by strong growth across each of our business segments.","Revenues in South America decreased 6%, reflecting the recent softness in the market, which gives us some concern regarding the outlook for 2014 production in the South American region.","Slide 14 reconciles the $125 million increase in EBITDA to $611 million. As I mentioned, that's an increase of 26%, reflecting flow-through on higher revenue, solid operating performance, and MVL-related synergies, partially offset by price downs and increased investment in information systems and advanced engineering. As already mentioned, EBITDA margins increased 170 basis points to 14.6%.","Slide 15 details our segment results. Electrical architecture adjusted revenue was up 12% from the prior period, driven by strong growth in China, North America and Europe. Segment EBITDA increased to $318 million. That represents 15.5% EBITDA margins, up 240 basis points from the prior year, the result of flow-through on revenue growth, continued strong operating performance and synergies from the MVL acquisition.","Revenue in our Powertrain segment totaled just under $1.1 billion. That's up roughly 3%, the result of strong growth in North America, low-single digit growth in Europe and Asia, partially offset by lower revenues in South America.","As I mentioned on our third quarter call, the mix headwind related to lower sales of diesel fuel injection systems is behind us, but it will not turn into a tailwind during 2014.","Segment EBITDA increased $29 million to $177 million, and EBITDA margins expanded to 16%, primarily the result of savings from our restructuring initiatives, timing of engineering rebuilds and volume growth.","In our Electronics and Safety segment, revenue totaled $692 million. That's an 8% increase from the prior period, the result of strong double-digit growth in Asia and solid growth in North America and Europe, partially offset by lower revenues in South America. The sale of Active Safety products almost doubled during the quarter, which is partially offset by lower sales of less profitable mechatronics products.","Segment EBITDA increased to $99 million, and margins totaled 14%, reflecting flow-through on higher revenues and improved product mix, more than offset by increased spend-related advanced engineering and information systems, as well as timing associated with engineering rebuilds.","Lastly, Thermal revenues increased 7% to $373 million, and EBITDA was up slightly to $17 million, representing 4.6% margins, flat year-over-year, but up sequentially. We expect Thermal margins to continue to improve on a sequential basis throughout the balance of 2014.","Turning to Slide 16. Earnings per share increased $0.22 or 24% to $1.12, driven by increased earnings and a lower share count, partially offset by a higher tax rate, which was 9% for the quarter versus 8% in the same period last year.","Moving to Slide 17 to touch on our full year results. We delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth in a relatively challenging environment in Europe during the first half of the year. Revenue totaled $16.5 billion. That's up 6%. EBITDA totaled almost $2.4 billion. And EBITDA margins increased 70 basis points to 14.5%. Net income increased to just under $1.4 billion. Earnings per share totaled $4.40. That's an increase of almost 15%. And free cash flow totaled just under $1.1 billion.","So with that as a backdrop, let's move to Slide 18 to review revenue for the full year in greater detail.","As I mentioned, reported revenue was up 6% to just under $16.5 billion. Price down totaled 1.5%, which were in line with our expectations. FX and commodity prices had about a $67 million positive impact on revenue, adding 1 point to our year-over-year growth rate. Sales volume totaled $417 million, adding 3 points growth. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added $695 million of revenues or 5 points of growth. Excluding FX, commodity prices and acquisitions, revenues were up 1%.","On a regional basis, our revenues were strongest in Asia, up 11%, driven by continued strong double-digit growth in China. Revenues increased 5% in North America and 2% in South America, and declined 6% in Europe, reflecting lower vehicle production, further exacerbated by mix headwinds related to the sale of diesel fuel injection systems in the light vehicle and the commercial vehicle markets.","Slide 19 illustrates the benefits of our lean and flexible cost structure, which has driven significant margin expansion. EBITDA totaled almost $2.4 billion for the year. That's an increase of over 11%, reflecting the impact of price downs, which is more than offset by very strong operating performance flow-through and volume growth, MVL-related synergies and restructuring benefits. EBITDA margins expanded 70 basis points to 14.5%.","Slide 20 includes our segment financial results. Electrical architecture's adjusted revenues increased 6% to over $7.2 billion, and EBITDA margins expanded 160 basis points to 15.5%.","Revenue in our Powertrain segment was down 6% to $4.4 billion, primarily the result of a 10% reduction in European revenues and softness in the global automotive aftermarkets. EBITDA margins in this segment declined 30 basis points to 15.2%, reflecting the impact of this lower revenue, as well as product mix, partially offset by cost reduction initiatives.","Revenue in our Electronics and Safety segment was up 2% to almost $2.8 billion, driven by strong growth in Asia and mid-single-digit growth in North America, partially offset by lower revenues in Europe and South America. As a result of revenue growth, improved business mix and operating performance, EBITDA margins increased by 70 basis points to 14%. And lastly, thermal revenues declined 2% and EBITDA margins totaled 5.4% for the year.","Turning to Slide 21. Earnings per share increased 15% from $3.84 to $4.40, primarily the result of earnings growth, but also benefiting from share buybacks, both of these partially offset by higher taxes on a year-over-year basis.","Moving to Slide 22. In 2013, we generated almost $1.8 billion of operating cash flow. That's up almost $300 million from the prior year, primarily the result of increased earnings and lower CapEx. We used our cash flow to fund just over $680 million of CapEx during the year, make $85 million of mandatory debt paydowns and returned almost $670 million of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We remain very committed to executing a very balanced and disciplined capital allocation plan.","Slide 23 details the assumptions underlying our 2014 guidance. We're forecasting global production of roughly 90 million units, which represents a 3% increase. Looking at our forecast by major region, in North America, our guidance assumes a 4% increase of production. In China, we're expecting production growth of 9%. We're forecasting European production to increase 1% year-over-year. And in South America, we're forecasting a 5% increase in production for the year, which, as I mentioned earlier, we're watching closely. It does give us some concern based on the recent environment in the region. For the first quarter, we're forecasting global vehicle production of roughly 22.5 million units that represents a 4% year-over-year increase.","Turning to Slide 24 to reiterate the 2014 full year guidance we provided at the Deutsche Bank conference in January. Before I get into the numbers, we previously mentioned that we intend to implement additional restructuring initiatives during 2014 to further reduce our Western European footprint. These initiatives will bring our cash outlays related to restructuring to roughly $200 million in 2014. That's an increase of roughly $50 million over the prior year. As a result of the nature and timing of the initiatives, savings in 2014 for these incremental programs will not be significant.","We currently expect full year revenue to be in the range of $17.2 billion to $17.6 billion. That's a 6% increase over 2013, roughly 3-points over Delphi's served markets at the midpoint of our guidance range. Operating income is forecast to be $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion, reflecting the impact of flow-through on volume and continued strong operating performance, partially offset by a $60 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, which will total roughly $600 million in 2014.","Operating margins will increase to 11.3% to 11.6%, and EBITDA margins will be in the range of 14.8% to 15.1%. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.95, representing 10% growth at the midpoint and is based on a share count of 309 million and an 18% tax rate.","Turning to the first quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, representing 6% growth, roughly 2-points over market. Operating income will be in the range of $435 million to $460 million, reflecting the benefits of volume growth, partially offset by increased engineering and information systems expense and lower engineering rebuilds. Operating margins will be in the range of 10.4% to 10.7%, and EBITDA margins will be in the range of 13.7% to 14%.","We expect EPS to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.08, and again, that assumes 309 million shares outstanding. We expect the first and second quarter tax rates to be 19% this year. That's about 1 point higher than our outlook for the full year reflecting regional mix and timing of planning initiatives. I'll now turn it back to Rod for some closing remarks before Q&A.","Rodney O'Neal","Thanks, Kevin. Please move to Slide 26. In closing, before we go to the Q&A, just a reminder. Delphi had a terrific year, and the team did a great job in terms of execution. So looking forward, we are well-positioned for top and bottom line expansion, driving earnings per share growth. We continue to invest in market-leading technologies and we continue to have a very disciplined approach to how we allocate our capital.","So with that, let's open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A couple of housekeeping questions and a strategic question. On the housekeeping backlog, are you going to be giving that to us at the Investor Day, or can you comment on it?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, Brian, we're going to give that to you at the Investor Day. We needed to save something new for that day in March. I will say, we've talked about it in the past. As we look at 2014, we would expect net new business to be between $800 million and $900 million for the year, to give you an idea of our perspective for the current calendar year.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And second, on the guidance, you talked about FX and commodity rates stable, South America growing. What's the risk there from the current emerging market headwinds in South America, and is that something you thought about -- you've considered when you've reiterated your 2014 guide?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, it's something we've considered. When you look at our exposure to emerging markets, really, setting aside China, we have a business model where we typically don't price in local currency. When we do, we have the ability to pass on labor inflation or changes in foreign exchange, Brian. And most of the emerging markets, including places like Turkey, are actually locations that we manufacture in and export out of. So again, the current environment was contemplated in our guidance, and we have it well-managed.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then the more strategic question is, where can you really see EA going? It looks like you're getting both good revenue growth there with say, because of Connected Car and good margin results there, certainly year-over-year. Do you see room for both acceleration of revenue growth and for margin expansion? Or is it more revenue growth and the margins are where they're going to get?","Kevin P. Clark","No, we think there's an opportunity for both. I mean, to your point, as content -- as electric content goes into the car, there's more opportunity for the electronic backbone and nurse [ph] center that electrical architecture provides. And as you look at margin, based on both operating performance, as well as mix, when you look at connectors relative to wire harnesses, there's the opportunity to further enhance the margin profile of the business. And we'll update at our March investor meeting our outlook for long-term margins in the business.","Rodney O'Neal","Brian, that was a little bit of the beauty of the MVL acquisition. It was to slightly modify the DNA of our existing electrical architecture business with the infusion of additional connectors. As a result of that, what we tried to create and have accomplished is a business that has really good top line, but also margin expansion. And so we'll get into it more at the Investor Day, but we're quite pleased with where we are and we believe we have significant market momentum going forward.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And roughly, what is connectors as a percent of EA now after the integration of MVL?","Kevin P. Clark","It's 20% to 25%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you give us a little bit more on that Q1 guidance. If we were to sort of think of about the bridge year-over-year, you've got, in your guidance, like $176 million to $276 million of top line growth and EBIT growth of $4 million to $29 million. What are some of the headwinds that are incorporated in that?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, you -- what a nice turf. Rod, I'd look at it 2 ways. One, I'd look at it on a sequential basis. I think that's helpful. And as you look at revenues on a sequential basis, the business will grow roughly 3%. When you -- on a sequential basis, when you look at things like engineering rebuilds, which tend to be much stronger in the fourth quarter than they are in the first quarter, you have about $30 million to $40 million of engineering rebuilds that fall out on a sequential basis. So that should help explain some of the transition in profitability. When you look at it on a year-over-year basis, again, 6% growth, about 2 points above market. When you look at flow-through, we have, on an incremental basis, we've talked about spending an additional -- making additional investments, I'm sorry, in IT and engineering, there's about $20 million or $25 million on a year-over-year basis that I would call growth investments in engineering and IT that affect the margin. So those -- that's the big explanation of the change regarding flow-through on a year-over-year basis.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And what are your regional production assumptions in the quarter?","Kevin P. Clark","Our regional production assumptions -- bear with me one moment, if I could. Europe, up about 3.5%; North America, 6.5%; China, about 8%; and year-over-year, about 4% production.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. In the quarter in your bridge, you showed performance of about $50 million, pricing was $60 million, so it's largely being offset. But I think you include the MVL in that line? Could you just comment a little bit about -- if we were to extrapolate from that, what's the underlying ability to mitigate price deflation as you look out to 2014?","Rodney O'Neal","Sure. Well, in that line, as you can imagine, there is a lot of moving parts. We build a plan to have performance initiatives that offset price, as well as economics. And we work hard to perform towards that. When you look at it on a fourth quarter basis, we had performance initiatives that actually exceeded price. But we had a little bit of mix, quite frankly, that went against us in the quarter on a year-over-year basis to the tune, I don't know, of about $30 million.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But you're still expecting to exceed that. I think you were originally targeting something like $120 million of synergies in 2014. Is that something that you feel pretty comfortable exceeding the pricing in the year?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, as we look at 2014, the last that we talked about it on Q3, our Q3 call, as we expected, between $100 million to $120 million of synergies and restructuring benefits in 2014 calendar year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a first question on South America. I know it's about 6% of your total sales. But could you just comment on your profitability down there just so we can understand what the risk is around sort of the potential macro swings?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, we don't give profitability by region, John. But as we said in the past, that is a region, over the last couple of years, given what's going on from an inflation standpoint, labor cost standpoint, it's been less profitable than our corporate average.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just a second question on Powertrain. You've had a couple of good quarters here. Second quarter was 16.4% on EBITDA margin and then fourth quarter was 16%. It sounds like the business is normalizing as far as mix in Europe. Are we going to see a 16% margin potential in Powertrain in the near term? I know that's kind of sort of longer-term, which some people are expecting. But it sounds like you guys are performing very well there. I know the second quarter was a big quarter, but we got another good one here in the fourth quarter.","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, I -- listen, I don't know, sitting in my chair right now. We're going to definitely have quarters throughout the calendar year that are at 16% or better. I would -- as I look at 2014, our expectation would be that EBITDA margins be a little bit below 16% at this point in time, and then we'd be above 16% in '15 and beyond.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just on DNA versus CapEx. The DNA at $600 million versus CapEx of $800 million, the spread between DNA and CapEx is opening up, which indicates you've got a lot of investment for growth coming in '14 that should come in '15, '16 and '17. Is that sort of a correct interpretation? Or is there something going on with timing? And over time, are we 3 to 5 years out when DNA matches CapEx or are we going to continue to see this kind of gap for a while?","Kevin P. Clark","Hey, listen, it's probably 5 years out. When you look at our CapEx spend for 2013 and calendar year '14, roughly 30% to 40% would be what we refer to as maintenance. The balance is all related to growth initiatives, new programs.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just lastly, on the European restructuring, $200 million being spent in '14, what's the payback period you expect for that roughly?","Kevin P. Clark","Those programs tend to be, as you may know in Europe, the restructuring in Europe tends to be more costly. The average program is roughly 3 years. And that's why you're not going to see much incremental benefit in calendar year 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can I start on Slide 8 where you listed a bunch of new technologies there. Can you talk about how much of your revenue base -- I don't know if that's possible, but how much of your revenue base comes from those products and how much of your backlog does if there -- or any color you can give in that kind of context would be great.","Rodney O'Neal","Well, I think we'll cover a lot more of that at the Investor Day. And so if you could just wait a few weeks, we'll make you happy.","Kevin P. Clark","I would say, these are all technologies that we introduced in 2013 calendar year. So David, as you look at, or you talk about these specific part numbers, they tend to be relatively small. Now there's some technologies, right, that are advances on our existing technologies and -- like the heavy-duty diesel common rail system that needs new standards. We can update you in March.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then can we talk a bit about the commercial vehicle side and the Euro 6 pre-buy, very strong build rates here at the end of Q4, very weak in Q1, and how much of a factor that's playing into some of the revenue numbers we're seeing?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, we saw a very strong December. And across our businesses, we estimate that the prebuy was roughly $20 million in the quarter. So that does explain a little bit of a walk from Q4 to Q1.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, okay. And then, lastly, just at the CES, you showed a lot of technology, a lot of investments and focus on infotainment, and that's been a part of the business in the past around that you've sort of backed away from a little bit. It looks like it's moved back to the front burner as a growth opportunity for you. Can you just talk about that a bit?","Rodney O'Neal","Well, it's a very interesting space. Very dynamic. And David, I don't know if I backed away from that. I think I was just being more futuristic in terms of where I thought the ultimate business would go. But we're very pleased with where the business was today. And also, over the short-term horizon, we always felt that it would be a growth engine for our company. And so we're pretty excited about it. And as you -- as the convergence of infotainment and safety continue to come together, there's plenty of opportunity. I think you saw an announcement yesterday where the government is beginning to think about legislation of having vehicles talk to one another. The rules of engagement have yet to be determined. But obviously, it's pretty exciting for us to hear that because it's not so much that the vehicles will talk to one another. What's exciting to me and the team is what do we have the opportunity to do when they do begin to communicate because obviously, you have to take that communication and do something with it in order to mitigate potential collisions, et cetera. So it's a pretty exciting space, as it -- particularly when you look at it from a convergence and the safety aspect. And we'll cover more of that in March.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions on 1Q, the guidance. I think 1Q of 2013 was probably a trough quarter for European production. So I'm expecting that's going to be a tailwind in 1Q '14 that should at least partially help offset the R&D investment cost. So if you could just comment on that. And also, you seem to be guiding to a pretty sharp ramp in margins through 2014. Does that mean most of investment costs are going to be in 1Q?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, Ravi, this is Kevin. I'll take the first shot at it, and Rod, if you want comment. As we look at the first quarter, when we look at Europe, I would say Europe's going to be our slowest, actually, from a growth rate standpoint, it'll be towards the slower end of overall growth for us. A part of that will continue to be Powertrain. It's stabilized in Q3 and grew slightly in Q4. But when you look at the year-over-year comparison to Q1 of 2013, it'll still be down. So that's my point on it won't be a tailwind in Q1, and quite frankly, it probably won't be in Q2, either. So that's a bit of what affects growth in the first quarter or the optics of growth in the first quarter of the year. As it relates to investments. Our investment, I think it's fair to say, is fairly front-end loaded, and performance initiatives kind of roll out through the balance of the year. So it's timing of spend, and it's not all in Q1, it's spreaded throughout the year. But it's also timing of the rollout of the various performance and productivity initiatives that we have.","Rodney O'Neal","And Ravi, the other thing is as you saw in Q3 and Q4 of 2013, the stabilization of both our Powertrain and our Thermal business. And this, sequentially, as Kevin talked about, was the improvement year. So that's a little bit of the ramp-up you're seeing also.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And just one housekeeping question. Kevin, you said that the first half tax rate is going to be 19%, and you have 18% over the full year. I'm assuming that means 17% for the second half and not 18% for second half.","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, I -- that's fair. It may in Q3 and Q4 vary a little bit off that 17%, Ravi. But that is a good assumption.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citigroup.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a question on Slide 9 on the bookings. You had a terrific fourth quarter. Rod, I was hoping you could maybe talk about what you're seeing out there in the pipeline today. Was there any pull in Q4 from perhaps, 2014 opportunities? And then are you actually targeting a bookings number for the full year?","Rodney O'Neal","What we see for 2014 is a year that's equal to or better than '13. And there's plenty of opportunity. And we ended the year with a very high win rate. So in that, we expect that to carry over. So equal to or better than 2013 is where we're looking at.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Perfect. That's very helpful. And then, Kevin, just a question on the Thermal segment. I think you mentioned that you expect margins to gradually rise throughout the year. I think that segment actually has a bit higher South America exposure than some of the others. Can you maybe talk about the dynamics there and just sort of what the drivers are for margin improvement throughout the year in Thermal?","Kevin P. Clark","It's -- Itay, that's a great question. It's a mix of a couple of things: The restructuring program, the cost reduction initiatives that we've been putting in place and having them play out for the balance of the year, as well as you'll see a nice revenue ramp up throughout the year as a result of some of the new business bookings that they've won over the last couple of years. So a mix of cost-reduction, restructuring benefits and volume.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And just lastly, a quick housekeeping. What was the aftermarket contribution in the fourth quarter? Did that help the powertrain margins at all or is that not a big factor?","Kevin P. Clark","Not a big factor. Aftermarket was up year-over-year in the fourth quarter for us. But it's, as you know, it's a relatively small business and it wasn't a big contributor to that Powertrain growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, the main one I had left was on the revenue outperformance, you -- last year, obviously, I think organic growth you said was in and around 1%. I don't know if I'm getting that right. But somewhere kind of around or maybe lower than the addressable market. This year -- obviously, in the fourth quarter, that changed. You outperformed the addressable market pretty substantially. And it seems like you have something similar baked in for maybe around 200 basis points of outperformance for -- or 300 for 2014. So can you just give us a breakdown of the components of that shift? How much of it is backlog? How much of it is mix? Sort of geographic versus customer? Just to help us understand that.","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, Patrick, it's Kevin. I'm not sure I have it quite laid out in that sort of way. It is a mix of the new business bookings that we've had as well as at least in the back half of the year, when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, not having that -- seeing the Powertrain business actually continue to grow sequentially, as well as year-over-year. That will be a big driver of the growth. Electrical Architecture will continue to have very robust growth on a full year basis, as will Thermal. Thermal, as we see, have continued improvement in their overall business.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just diving into one element of that. I don't think we brought up as much at this call, which was obviously a big focus last year which was mix in Europe. One of the things that's been kind of commented on by your peers is that some of the rebounds you're seeing might be in Southern Europe more than Germany. How do you see the mix playing out within Europe for your major customers for 2014 versus '13?","Kevin P. Clark","I think if you look at the industry numbers today, I think you're right. Today, they would say that the OEs in Southern Europe, from a growth rate standpoint, coming off of a fairly low base, will outgrow the Northern Europeans. I think that's some of the base line, including in our production assumptions, as well as our revenue assumptions for 2014. So Rod, if you want to...","Rodney O'Neal","Absolutely, I mean, when you look at the year-over-year, the bulk of the improvement is actually in some of the OEs that had, quite frankly, a disastrous '13. So it's up but up off of a very low number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Just wanted to come back for a second on your pace of organic growth. Obviously, the fourth quarter was a good one in terms of outperformance versus the industry. For '14, you're guiding to about 3 point above the market. When we -- when you look further out into your book to business, do you feel that, over time, beyond '14, where maybe there's some delayed launches, do you feel like over time you have the room to outperform the market by a larger amount than 2 or 3 points?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. Yes, we do. I think the -- when you look at our level of booked business, setting aside some of the shifting of schedules for launches which can take place. If you look at our product areas and where we reside and where we make products, we're confident that we have a business that grows in excess of 3 points over market.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. And would that be back to sort of your historical range of like 4%, 5%? Or is that -- or is it too early to quantify?","Kevin P. Clark","I think it's maybe a little early to quantify. But I think 4 to 5 points over market is very reasonable.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. And then just a clarification on the additional investments in IT and engineering. So you're pretty clear that in the first quarter, this could be sort of a $20 million, $25 million incremental cost on the year-over-year basis, and that a lot of these things are front-end loaded. How should we think about that year-over-year walk for the remaining quarter of the year? Is it all mostly spent in the first quarter or is it still going to be sort of an incremental cost?","Kevin P. Clark","No, it will be an incremental cost. So when you look at IT growth -- what we're calling growth investments in IT and engineering on a year-over-year basis, spend will be between $75 million and $100 million. Now that spend, we can calibrate. We can adjust to the extent the market softens and we need to respond to things. Correspondingly, it's spend that we can accelerate if we need to -- if the market strengthens.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Understood. And then finally, could you maybe comment on the -- what you're seeing in terms of the environment for acquisition? Obviously, you had completed a very successful one at the end of 2012, but not in 2013. Can you maybe tell us what you're seeing these days?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, in the fourth quarter of this past year, at least the acquisition environment improved and the amount of activity we had in and around acquisitions increased -- or potential acquisitions increased. So the environment was very strong in Q4. We'll see if that continues during 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lim with Wells Fargo.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. I just wanted to get your idea or color on infotainment take rates in the quarter. Have you seen an acceleration there? And also if you could sort of characterize the acceleration of recent bookings in the safety and infotainment entertainment space?","Kevin P. Clark","It's Kevin. With respect to take rates on infotainment systems and even in the high end, we've seen an increase bulk [ph] in the high-single digits from a take rate standpoint on infotainment systems. As it relates to Active Safety, growth in 2013 was significant. Year-over-year growth rate was almost doubled from an Active Safety standpoint. So extremely strong. We booked over $1 billion of Active Safety business in 2013, which is more than we booked cumulatively the prior 3 years. So very strong market as it relates to Active Safety. Your third question, I'm sorry?","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","No, that was actually it. But I do have a follow-up question. I mean, if you did $1 billion in bookings in 2013 -- and maybe I'm getting a little ahead of myself pre-Analyst Day. But any idea of the growth rate that you're anticipating for 2014?","Kevin P. Clark","2014 for Active Safety, looking at our Active Safety business, growth rate will be about 50%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Market.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just headed back to the acquisition environment comment earlier. I mean, obviously, you did a very successful one on the E&A side. What about -- and I think you've said in the past, you'd still be interested in additional tuck-ins there, although they may not be available. But what about on the E&S side? I mean, how -- are you comfortable with your portfolio? Is that an area where you could also look to -- for some tuck-in acquisitions?","Rodney O'Neal","Yes, I mean, we've been pretty consistent in terms of the space that we're focused on from an acquisition perspective. It was Powertrain, electronics and electrical. And so the answer to your question explicitly is yes, it is -- it's an area of focus, and we're always looking.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just bigger picture on the E&A side. I mean, I think, typically, you haven't seen a lot of displacement. So once you're in with the customer, or certainly, a platform, given the critical nature and the design process, you're in there. But in speaking to some of the players in the industry, it does seem like there's maybe been a little bit more movement, at least in terms of share, on that front. Can you comment on that or confirm that? And if there is a little bit more movement than in the past, why do you think that's happening?","Rodney O'Neal","I want to make sure I understand your question. When you say the movement of share, you mean like movement from, like, Delphi to another competitor?","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Are you -- if you're gaining share or losing share. I guess, I just want to get your perspective on just share shifts.","Rodney O'Neal","No, we're doing quite well, obviously. This business has a very wide moat and deep moat, and it's able to conquest business because of its technical promise and also, because of complexity of the business, its operational excellence, and its global span. I think it operates in like 33 countries. So it's absolutely impressive. And so our win rates have actually accelerated in our business, particularly as the electrical architecture or the more content in vehicles have gotten more complex. And so we're actually seeing a movement in the marketplace into our sweet spot of complexity and ability to have to -- to do multiple things for the OE to win in the marketplace, and one is elimination of waste, creation of space by shrinking the amount of real estate that our electrical architect occupies. And so we have a wonderful value prop, not just technically, operationally, but also how we bring it all together to create a value profit that does so many things for the vehicle, all the way down to improving fuel economy.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Kevin, if I could sneak one in just housekeeping. It's really back to the cadence here. I mean, in the fourth quarter, you outperformed the goal production by about 4 points, and the second quarter it's sort of looking more like 2. Even if we adjust for the year of prebuy which is maybe 50 bps, is that just cadence of launch of the backlog is also a little bit more back-half weighted?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, I think it's just roll-on and roll-off of business. If I can make one additional comment on EA, because I think it's important. If you look at that business, in this past year, it grew roughly 3 points over market. Some of that is growth in content in vehicles. Some of that is market share. Having said that, the one thing, and we don't talk about it a lot, but it's worth noting. There is business that we've decided that we had and we've decided not to pursue because it's not at margin rates or returns that are acceptable. And that is most prevalent, quite frankly, in the European region. So I just wanted to add that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just one to kind of follow on with the M&A questions. What do you think the likelihood of -- you're obviously looking at a number of deals, so on and so forth, but where are you at in the stage of looking at those deals? Are you kind of in initial stages? Or is there something that you're maybe a little bit farther down the road? I guess, what I'm really driving at is what's the likelihood, in your opinion, of completing something in that 2014 timeframe?","Kevin P. Clark","We would say it's impossible to predict, right? I mean, looking at acquisitions, it takes 2 parties to agree on value, on timing, and there are a lot of variables that affect that. So it's too difficult to predict. I would say the level of activity, our activity and just general activity in the market increased in Q4, and I would expect that to continue at least into the early part of 2014.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then switching gears and talking about margins. As I look back at your presentation from last year, you've got about 50 to 150 basis points of margin expansion necessary to kind of hit the -- your objectives in the electrical powertrain and electronics segments. As I look at the Thermal, it looks like it's kind of around 600, 650 basis points of margin expansion from where you're currently at. Pretty significant change there. Can you talk about what are your expectations today in that Thermal segment for margins longer-term? And then, secondly, what are the primary drivers to allow you to improve the margins in that segment?","Rodney O'Neal","Yes, the expectations are -- should be in the double-digit range, above double-digit, actually. And what's going to drive it is the diversification, both customer and geographic, of the book business, which has been significant, that is now starting to roll on. So we're going to get a revenue lift and then we will also get an operational lift because we're going to be executing at a higher level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Stover with Guggenheim.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I just have a couple of details here. Kevin, did you say that on the EBITDA walk, your R&D rebuilds were a favorable effect in the fourth quarter year-over-year comp?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","To what magnitude?","Kevin P. Clark","About $20 million to $30 million year-over-year.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And if I think of synergy at 100 to 120 this year, obviously, most of the synergy confers to E&A. What businesses should we see the biggest effects from a restructuring standpoint?","Kevin P. Clark","You'll see -- I mean, some of that does reside in E&A. You'll see continued benefit at E&S. You'll see continued benefits at Thermal, as well as some benefits at Powertrain.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","At the beginning of the Q&A, I believe you mentioned that the backlog for '14 was $800 million to $900 million, which seems to be down from $1.1 billion last year and the 3-year backlog guidance. Any color on why it's down? Is it just remeasurements or is there business that's been pushed out?","Kevin P. Clark","No, it's really, Colin it's Kevin, it's the pushout of some programs, both European programs that were scheduled to launch that were pushed out by the OEs, as well as some delays in some of the electric vehicle programs in North America and in Europe.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And can you remind me the impact from lower management incentive accruals this year? I thought it was something like $80 million?","Kevin P. Clark","It's about $80 million from walking from '12 to '13.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And is there any change this year? Because that was a tailwind, right?","Kevin P. Clark","It'll be a headwind this year. It will be up roughly $10 million to $20 million.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And with that $80 million, that will be embedded in your net performance and other walk?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. Yes.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just lastly, on cash flow, I mean, maybe a little color. It looks like your guidance for cash flow before financing is flat year-over-year. Is that mostly just a higher CapEx? And I think you mentioned $50 million in incremental restructuring?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, yes, if you break it down, there's about $150 million of CapEx, $50 million of incremental restructuring spend, and then you have the investment in working capital as the business grows.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So some working capital. And in terms of that restructuring, it's about $200 million. So is that a tailwind when that comes off in '15?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, I would expect it to be a tailwind in '15.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Of about $200 million...","Kevin P. Clark","Probably not about $200 million dollars. Probably in the neighborhood of $50 million to $100 million.","Jessica L. Holscott","Great. Thank you for participating in today's call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Delphi Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the call over to Jessica Holscott, Delphi's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jessica, you may begin your conference.","Jessica L. Holscott","","Thank you, Steve, and thanks for joining Delphi's first quarter earnings call. To follow along with today's presentation, our slides can be found at delphi.com under the Investors section of the website. Please see slide two for a disclosure on forward-looking statements, which we will be making on today's call and only reflect Delphi's current view of future financial performance, which may be materially different from our actual performance.","Joining us today will be Rod O'Neal, Delphi's CEO and President; as well as Kevin Clark, our CFO. As seen on slide three, Rod will begin with an overview of the quarter, followed by Kevin, who will review our financial results in greater detail, discuss our 2014 outlook, and then we'll open up the line for Q&A.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Rod.","Rodney O'Neal","","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. I deeply appreciate you joining us today. Let me start out with a very important fact in that we had a great quarter. It was a great first quarter. And as you remember from our recent Investor Day in New York, we told you that Delphi was focused on three strategic imperatives to continue to drive shareholder value, and these included disciplined revenue growth, margin expansion, and increasing returns on capital. And our management team is built upon these imperatives in the first quarter, and we are meeting our commitments to continue to deliver value to our shareholders.","If you can move to slide five please. Before I get into the quarter, I want to talk a little bit about the current macro environment. Europe has stabilized. South America, well, that market continues to deteriorate, so we\u2019re keeping a very close eye on that part of the world. North America has shown steady growth and the market in China continues to be strong.","So let\u2019s look at the quarter. Revenue was up 6%. Earnings were up 12%. And we returned $230 million of cash to shareholders, including the repurchase of over $150 million of stock. We remain confident in Delphi and our outlook for 2014.","Slide six, please. Game-changing technology is at the core of Delphi\u2019s success and here\u2019s more proof. Delphi recently won its 17th Automotive News PACE Award and was a finalist for two other technologies. I\u2019m really extremely proud of our technical community and the culture of innovation that they foster each and every day. This prestigious award highlights our commitment to providing leading-edge technical solutions to the marketplace.","Slide seven. Our Q1 bookings were in line with our expectations and the customer cadence for the new business opportunities, which is consistent with last year. We remain confident that we\u2019ll achieve our target in 2014.","Our first quarter awards include electrical architecture wins in Asia with OEs like Geely and Great Wall as well as a Chrysler award for infotainment in North America. We have a mission to further diversify revenues. As you can see on the chart on the right, we continue to do so with our bookings.","Slide eight. Delphi\u2019s 2014 priorities, they remain unchanged. And we are focused on one thing and one thing only and that is increasing shareholder value. We will do this through disciplined revenue growth, further optimizing our operating footprint, and aggressively rationalizing our cost structure, and also introduce advanced technologies to provide solutions for our customers\u2019 challenges, all of which translates into expanded margins and [increased earnings] (ph). We will continue to drive increased shareholder value by deploying capital in a very disciplined manner.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin to cover the numbers. Kevin?","Kevin P. Clark","","Thanks a lot, Rod. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering our first quarter results, and then provide an update of our full-year guidance and the second quarter outlook.","Consistent with our prior earnings call, today's review of our actual and forecasted results will exclude all restructuring and other non-recurring costs. The reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are included at the back of both this presentation and the press release for your reference.","So let me start at slide 10 with a snapshot of our first-quarter financial performance, which Rod touched on. Revenue is in line with our expectations, primarily driven by very strong growth in China and North America, and an improving European market, which translated into significant margin expansion and earnings per share growth.","Reported revenue totaled $4.3 billion, that\u2019s up over 6%, that\u2019s roughly one point over the mark-up. Operating income increased to $483 million and operating margins expanded 60 basis points to 11.3%. Net income increased almost 10% to $368 million, reflecting earnings growth, partially offset by an increased tax rate.","And earnings per share increased over 12% to $1.20. Lastly, operating cash flow totaled $136 million, reflecting the seasonal investment in working capital, as well as cash taxes and restructuring expense. I\u2019ll cover each of these financial metrics in greater detail during the presentation.","So let\u2019s move to slide 11 and I\u2019ll review first quarter revenue in greater detail. As I just mentioned, reported revenue increased over 6% to $4.3 billion. Pricedowns of 1.4%, and lower copper pricing pass-throughs totaled $77 million. That - combined, those present a 2 point headwind to our year-over-year growth rate. FX, primarily the result of a stronger euro, added $43 million to revenues, and over 1 point to our growth rate. And volume totaled $286 million, adding 7 points to growth.","Moving to revenues on a regional basis, European revenues were in line with the outlook we provided during our last earnings call, up just over 2%, reflecting increasing stability in the Western European market, partially offset by declining revenues in the automotive aftermarket. As a side-note, operating margins expanded approximately 100 basis points in this region, due to the strong operating performance, as well as benefits from the restructuring initiatives we\u2019ve put in place over the last 18 months.","North American revenues increased 8% as a result of solid market growth and strong revenues with the domestic OEs primarily. Revenues in Asia continue to be very strong, increasing over 12%, driven by almost 15% revenue growth in China. And revenues in South America declined roughly 9%, reflecting the deterioration in the market that Rod commented on during his remarks and the issue that we flagged as a potential concern during last quarter\u2019s earnings call.","Fortunately, this region represents only 6% of our revenues and we\u2019ve adjusted our cost structure to address the macro environment in this market. We\u2019ll cover our outlook for this region in more detail when we review our second quarter and full-year outlook.","Slide 12 reconciles the year-over-year change in operating income, which increased $52 million or over 12% to $483 million. The increase was the result of strong flow-through on revenue growth, solid operating performance, net of the incremental investments in information systems and advanced engineering to support future growth, and benefits from foreign exchange, primarily a weaker Mexican peso, partially offset by pricedowns and increased depreciation and amortization expense.","As I mentioned, operating margins increased 60 basis points to 11.3%. Not on this chart, but as a point of reference, EBITDA increased $66 million to $628 million and EBITDA margins totaled 14.7%.","Slide 13 includes our segment results. Electrical architecture\u2019s adjusted revenue totaled over $2.1 billion, that\u2019s up over 10% from the prior period, driven by strong double-digit growth in North America and Asia, single-digit growth in Europe, partially offset by lower revenues in Brazil, reflecting the current market conditions.","Segment operating income increased to $273 million, which represented 12.9% operating margins, up 90 basis points from the prior year, primarily as a result of flow-through on the strong revenue growth, very strong operating performance and synergies from the MVL acquisition. As a point of reference again, EBITDA increased 18% to $337 million in the segment and EBITDA margins totaled roughly 16%.","Revenue in our Powertrain segment was in line with our expectations, totaling $1.1 billion, down about 3% year-over-year as a result of solid growth in North America, offset by slightly lower revenues in Europe, reflecting increasing stability in Western Europe, partially offset by slightly lower export revenues to the emerging markets of Russia and India, as well as lower revenues in Brazil, as well as continued softness in the automotive aftermarket really across all regions.","We expect continued sequential improvement in the powertrain revenues which will translate into very solid year-over-year growth in the back half of this year. Segment operating income increased to $115 million, representing 10.4% operating margins. It\u2019s a 10 basis point increase over the prior year as a result of strong operating performance and the timing of engineering rebuilds. EBITDA increased to $166 million and EBITDA margins expanded 20 basis points to 14.9%.","In our Electronics and Safety segment, revenue totaled over $700 million, representing a 4% increase over the prior period, driven by very strong growth in Asia, solid growth in Europe, partially offset by lower revenues in Brazil related to the weakness in the market, as well as lower revenues in North America, as a result of timing of new program launches.","We\u2019re expecting continued sequential revenue growth in the E&S segment, driven by the ramp up of new program launches in the back half of the year.","Segment operating margins increased 100 basis points to 11.4%, the result of flow-through on volume growth, strong operating performance, and the continued enhancement of our business mix. EBITDA increased over 13% to $102 million and EBITDA margins expanded 120 basis points to 14%.","Thermal revenues increased almost 8% to $387 million, driven by solid growth in Europe, Asia and North America, partially offset by declines in Brazilian revenues. Operating income totaled $12 million and operating margins were 3.1%, down on a year-over-year basis, but up 80 basis points on a sequential basis, representing the second straight quarter of sequential margin improvement. EBITDA totaled $23 million and EBITDA margins were 6% for the quarter.","We remain on track to significantly improve the performance in this segment, and we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll achieve operating and EBITDA margins of over 5% and 8%, respectively by the fourth quarter of this year.","Turning to slide 14, earnings per share increased over 12% to $1.20 driven by increased earnings and lower share count, partially offset by a 6 point increase in the effective tax rate to 18.5%. That increased as the result of the 2012 US R&D tax credit, which favorably impacted our 2013 first-quarter tax rate to the tune of about 6 points.","Moving to the balance sheet and capital deployment on slide 15, we ended the quarter with a solid balance sheet. Debt totaled $2.4 billion and balance sheet cash declined $400 million to just under $1 billion, reflecting the normal seasonal investment in working capital and Capex, $230 million of share repurchases and dividends that Rod referenced early and $120 million of cash taxes and restructuring spend. As a result, net debt increased to $1.5 billion or 0.6 times EBITDA.","As outlined in detail at our recent Investor Day, and Rod reiterated it again today, we remain committed to executing a very balanced and a very disciplined capital allocation plan. The M&A environment remains positive, but to the extent we cannot complete a value accretive transaction this year, we will accelerate our feats of returning cash to shareholders. ","So, moving to slide 16 which details some of the assumptions underlying our 2014 guidance, we\u2019re forecasting global vehicle production of a little over 90 million units. That represents a 2% increase in global production, that\u2019s down about 1 point from our prior guidance.","Looking at our forecast by major region, in North America, our guidance assumes a 4% increase in production. We\u2019re forecasting European production to increase just under 1%, reflecting continued stabilization in the Western Europe market, offset by decline in vehicle production in Eastern Europe.","In China, we\u2019re expecting production growth of 9% and in South America; we\u2019re forecasting a 10% decline in production, due to the rapidly deteriorating macro environment in this region. For the second quarter, we\u2019re forecasting global vehicle production of roughly 22.5 million units, that\u2019s flat with the second quarter of last year.","Now, turning to the slide 17 to discuss our 2014 full-year guidance, we continue to expect revenues in the range of $17.2 billion to $17.6 billion, reflecting 3 points of growth over the underlying market. We\u2019ve increased our outlook for operating income to a range of $1.975 billion to $2.05 billion, which includes $600 million of depreciation and amortization expense, a $60 million increase over the prior year.","We continue to expect tax rate of 18% for the full-year and we increased our EPS guidance to a range of $4.80 to $5.00, reflecting the strength of our first quarter earnings and a share count of 306 million. Cash flow, before financing, will total $1.1 billion with Capex expected to be roughly $800 million. ","Moving to the second quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $4.375 billion to $4.475 billion, reflecting a 4% increase year-over-year, 3 points over the underlying -- roughly 3 to 4 points over the underlying market. Operating income will be in the range of $525 million to $550 million, representing operating margins of 12% to 12.3%, and EPS will be in the range of $1.27 to $1.35, and that assumes 306 million shares outstanding and an effective tax rate which is just a little bit over 19%.","So with that, we\u2019d like to open the call up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","","I had a couple of things. So I was hoping, first of all, you might be able to talk about -- obviously, the margins came in quite a bit stronger than you were expecting when you provided your guidance for the first quarter. Maybe just kind of directionally, what were some of the big buckets that changed since you provided that guidance? And just looking out to the second quarter guidance margin of 12% to 12.3%, you did 12.1% last year. And just mathematically, it looks like an incremental margin of maybe 9% to 16%. This quarter was over 20%. What are some of the variances that we should be thinking about as we look at the guidance going forward?","Kevin P. Clark","Sure. Why don\u2019t I take this question and Rod can chime in. When you look at our actual results versus our original expectations when we gave guidance and you break it down into the big buckets for favorability, you look at it, flow-through on volume was very strong. That added about $10 million to $12 million of incremental operating income.","I\u2019d say that relates to both operating performance as well as business mix. Pricing was a couple of million dollars favorable to where we -- our original expectation. Performance, from a material standpoint, did extremely well during the quarter. That added about $10 million to $12 million of favorability.","And then we got, I don\u2019t know, $12 million to $14 million quite frankly is favorability related to FX gains on hedges, as well as commodity prices. So, those are the big buckets that reconcile the difference.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. And then the incremental margin moderating in the second quarter?","Kevin P. Clark","I think if you look at it on a sequential basis, we have very, very strong flow-through going from Q1 to Q2, and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s roughly 35% flow-through, so I want to start with that. When you look at it on a year-over-year basis, one of the items that you got to adjust for is we have roughly $10 million or $12 million of commercial and legal settlements in the first quarter of last year that won\u2019t occur or won\u2019t repeat in -- or in the second quarter of last year, I\u2019m sorry, Rod, that won\u2019t repeat in the second quarter of this year. If you adjust for that, you will see that our flow-through is roughly 18% to 20% on an OI basis.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","","And on that EBIT bridge that you provide, you've historically had net performance that's a lot closer to the price deflation that you see. I think that you guys have already commented that this year, you're planning to spend some additional money on IT infrastructure and a few other things. How should we be thinking about that, how that number is really kind of breaking down? And what should we be expecting for the rest of the year?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. I think if you look at it -- if you peel that performance piece apart, on the chart, it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re offsetting price. Again, on a year-over-year basis, there is about a $10 million headwind associated with legal and commercial settlements in the first quarter of last year that didn\u2019t repeat in the first quarter of this year.","So, I\u2019d say, in fact, we did. We talked about an incremental, roughly $20 million year-over-year investment in engineering and IT-related growth initiatives. We did spend that money. So, those will be my big buckets -- the big buckets to explaining the year-over-year results.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. And just lastly, the pace of buybacks, the $150 million in the quarter, is that something that we should be assuming as kind of the run rate that you'd want to achieve this year, so maybe $600 million for buybacks and $300 million or so for dividends?","Kevin P. Clark ","","Yes. Listen, that\u2019s depending on how the M&A environment shapes out. I would say to the extent, we don\u2019t complete a transaction this year, I would expect in the back half of this year the pace of activity to actually pick up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","","Just a couple of questions here. Can you maybe talk about EEA, which seems to be your strongest growth, and are you seeing pull-through from, I guess, a couple different things, kind of connected car? Is that beginning to show up through this? Kind of if you look at how that's actually outgrowing E&S, is this kind of the sort of a derivative beneficiary of connected car that could actually grow faster than E&S despite your, by the way, guidance for the mid-year, which seemed to -- for the -- two or three years, which were more conservative on EEA?","Rodney O'Neal","Yes. I think just -- one, the connected car is really at the early stages, so you\u2019re not going to see any material significant dollar figure in our revenue this early on. We can circle back later and talk more in detail, but I guess the answer to your question is no.","What you\u2019re seeing is really the foundation, the work that resulted in a foundation that we laid a few years back in terms of diversification, both regionally and customer base wise with this customer and the addition of MVL into the business.","And it\u2019s worked out exactly the way we thought it would, and with significant increases in writing in the (indiscernible) like China et cetera along with a tremendous amount of customers. So it\u2019s just a model at work, and the entry of, what I\u2019ll call, the next phase of automated vehicles, that\u2019s not in play right now. You\u2019re just seeing the model doing what we always said it would do. There is no (indiscernible).","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Yes. No that was the EEA. So, does that mean that maybe EEA has upside to your guidance, and so you get more infotainment, more applications in the car kicking in over the next couple of years?","Rodney O'Neal","It\u2019s a very powerful force in the marketplace, this business. And assuming that the macros work itself out properly, we think what we\u2019re seeing will continue to transpire, but we do need the macros to co-operate. But the model is robust and this business is extremely strong.","Kevin P. Clark","Rod mentioned this before, one of the factors that we believe can affect the EEA growth -- it hasn\u2019t to date, but ultimately, as we said, they\u2019re the number one player in the market, and as you get bigger and as you get a bigger portion of the overall market, obviously it\u2019s harder to get market share gains.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","","Okay. And that was the assumption. And then maybe just a little more color. I know you gave some on sort of the seasonality of the bookings. And it is seasonally lower first quarter, but this first quarter was below first quarter last year, I mean, where is the quoting activity? And how do you get the confidence in hitting the $26 [billion] (ph)?","Rodney O'Neal","Yes. It\u2019s very similar, it\u2019s a little over, but in terms of our expectations, it\u2019s right on path. It was just really the cadence of what the opportunities were and also what finally got done in the first quarter. So I would expect a -- almost a replication of what occurred last year where there is a steady move north, as we get to the quarters.","I\u2019m just looking at the opportunities that are sitting there. Our win rates have not gone backwards and so the confidence just lies that we won that we were supposed to win in the first quarter, it is just a matter of opportunities. As I said, it was just cadence. That\u2019s where the confidence comes from.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a first question and it sort of is a follow-up, Kevin. You did mention, I think, in slide 10 and 12, as you were going through the operating walk, and I think Rod touched on this, but the IT and growth initiative costs in the quarter were a little bit of a headwind. Obviously, they are good things. But just curious when you think those ultimately may fade? Obviously, growth initiatives we want to never fade, but the IT and sort of infrastructure costs that you're working on right now, when do you think those fade? Or are those just ongoing?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, listen, I think it depends on the list of projects that we have and the returns on those listed products, the profitability they generate. As we talked about on the last call, we said on a fully-year basis, we\u2019d expect to spend $75 million to $100 million. I\u2019d say we\u2019re on pace from a full-year standpoint to probably spend roughly $90 million, $80 million to $90 million. And I\u2019d expect that to continue for the next couple of years.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a second question. As we look at the restructuring in Europe, obviously, it was a little bit of an upside there, it sounds like, in the quarter. What do you think the opportunity is for further restructuring in Europe as far as your execution or actions that you may need to take? And then also, very importantly, on the realization of the benefits?","Kevin P. Clark","Well, we continue to look at opportunities to opportunistically reduce our overall cost structure and rotate our footprint out of Western Europe to Eastern Europe. A part of that is - the decision related to that is operationally driven, depending where we sit from a capacity standpoint, production standpoint, and obviously part of it is the financial returns standpoint.","And I think we\u2019ll continue to look at our footprint. I would expect we\u2019ll continue to do some rotation of manufacturing and engineering over the next, I don\u2019t know, three-plus years of out of Western Europe to Eastern Europe, but it won\u2019t be on quite the order of magnitude of what we\u2019ve done over the last few years.","Rodney O'Neal","I think as you well know, when you\u2019re dealing with Western Europe, it\u2019s extremely difficult and to deal with moving work from high cost to low cost and then it\u2019s expensive. And so what we\u2019re always trying to do is balance the ability to do it with the payback.","And there\u2019s moments in time where it just makes so much sense that\u2019s why we seize the moment. And there\u2019s others that it just doesn\u2019t make sense for us to even deal with. And so I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job to-date of taking advantage of the situation, and we\u2019re going to continue to look at it.","As good as we are, there is a lot of opportunity for us to get better, but we\u2019re going to have to pick and choose where we decide to move and it\u2019s always going to be based on the ability to get a decent return of the investment.","Kevin P. Clark","And based on where we are from a rotational standpoint, John, quite candidly, we\u2019re now in the areas where the return and payback tend to be longer payback, roughly 2.5 to three years and slightly lower returns. So again to Rod\u2019s point, it\u2019s something that we look at very opportunistically.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","That's helpful. And then just lastly, Rod, there's two things that are happening in the market right now that seem they might impact the business in the longer term. And the first is that sort of cycle times or mid-cycle majors or mid-cycle refreshes are turning into majors. And the majors have a lot of electronic components being added, particularly the Toyota Camry is a great example right now. So it seems like there's a lot more opportunity that might be coming a lot faster towards you, but then there's also this big question around recalls and what kind of impact that may have on the business in slowing sort of these mid-cycle majors and the product cycles. So, I was just curious your view on the sort of those two competing forces on the potential to just clearly speed up and maybe slow down your business at the same time? Just generally what your thoughts are there.","Rodney O'Neal","Okay, you\u2019re off restructuring, I want to make sure I\u2019m not (indiscernible) you\u2019re just talking about some of the pace of the changes that we\u2019ve been doing. I wouldn\u2019t call those like, to me, it\u2019s not nothing new. I mean the speed-up has sort of been coming in the industry as OEs have tried to distinguish themselves from the competitors in the marketplace by constantly keeping their vehicles fresh.","And so it\u2019s - there is the majors, which I think you\u2019re talking, the sheet metal changes and then there is also the content which actually can run out of phase and sequence with the major. So, a little bit of the way I view is, is that the majors may -- they are important in the fact that it keeps their -- the car selling on a customer base.","And as you know, we don\u2019t make any money unless they sell the car. But in terms of the content, that\u2019s different and I think the emerging governmental trends and the emerging consumer trends, that\u2019s a different issue that really may or may not have anything to do with the pace of the majors, changes that the OEs are doing.","And so, when we\u2019ve got to keep track of and we\u2019re trying to do a good job of communicating with you guys, and what we see these trends that aren\u2019t exactly attached to, what I would call, the majors of the vehicle and how they would be dropped into existing vehicles and then enhanced as the majors come along. I view it as all good and I don\u2019t see it slowing us down, okay, at all. ","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And you don't think the recall activity would slow that at all either?","Rodney O'Neal","I\u2019m not sure why that would. You\u2019ve got an idea why you think it might?","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Well, just given that you increased complexity of the vehicle, and obviously, every little thing is being scrutinized right now that they might hold off a little bit on making these changes.","Rodney O'Neal","No, I think in general the industry has been somewhat conservative in terms of introducing, what I would call, like massive change across a wide variety of vehicles of a technology that doesn\u2019t have a history.","So, what the industry normally does is sticks its toe in the water with a very select vehicle, more high-end loaded and you run it, and then you put it on the vehicle as you get through the process and you move on.","So I don\u2019t view that at all as an issue. Okay? And I think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to still play itself out. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see technology that hasn\u2019t been proven in the marketplace, installed in across the entire fleet how it looks without it being introduced years in advance and incrementally bonded to the fleet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from City. Your line is now open.","Itay Michaeli - Citi","Just a question on EE&A. Strong performance in the quarter, I know that's a big segment for you in China and Asia. Just curious whether you saw comparable margin performance in some of the other regions around the world in that segment?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. Itay, it\u2019s Kevin. As we said before, we don\u2019t really breakout operating margins by regions for competitive reasons. They are fairly consistent across all regions. I would say in light of the Brazilian market, a little bit lower there if I can give you some color, but otherwise pretty consistent across the regions.","Itay Michaeli - Citi","And just back to the net performance in the quarter of $17 million. Sorry, if I missed this, Kevin, but how much restructuring savings, if any, did you actually realize in the quarter? And then if you can just kind of remind us of what you expect this year and then maybe even preliminarily for next year, broadly?","Kevin P. Clark","MVL and restructuring benefits on a year-over-year basis are roughly $20 million, which is incremental to that $51 million of performance that reconciled -- for Rod Lache, I should have highlighted that. On a fully-year basis, we\u2019re expecting roughly $100 million of restructuring and MVL benefits.","Itay Michaeli - Citi","That\u2019s very helpful. And then just lastly, the other income of $0.04 benefit in the quarter, what was that exactly?","Kevin P. Clark ","","We had an insurance settlement related to the Japanese tsunami a couple of years ago that comes in below the line. It was for indirect business interruption activity. Those were roughly $13 million on an aggregate basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Maybe just comment a little bit about Europe production overall. I know you gave your full-year guidance, which I think is consistent with IHS. But a couple suppliers reported yesterday and were suggesting that in 2Q as well as 1Q we might see better-than-expected production looking for an increase there, IHS thinks it's down 1%. Based upon what you're seeing on the ground, your orders and customers, is there anything you can say about that, whether Europe can be a help again in 2Q?","Kevin P. Clark","Ryan, it\u2019s Kevin. We\u2019ve seen again increasing stabilization in Western Europe, but conversely we\u2019ve actually seen lower production numbers come out of Eastern Europe. So, as we look at our build schedule relative to IHS, they\u2019re actually pretty close.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Okay, that's fair. That's helpful, thanks. And then is there anything you can say about your involvement in helping GM with their ignition switch recall issue? Maybe detail what you're doing there to help them? So, for example, is GM paying you for those parts or are you incurring any sort of overtime or premium freight costs? I don't think it would be material in any event, just sort of curious. And then how do you see your relationship with GM evolving? Could it be potentially strengthened by some extra efforts that you go through here or is it potentially hurt or kind of no impact at all? Or what can you say there?","Rodney O'Neal","As you know, we don\u2019t talk about what we\u2019re doing with our customers on any issue. And so those -- a lot of those questions, and the answer will have to come from those guys. But let me say this, we\u2019re working very, very closely and seamlessly with GM on this issue in order to solve the ramp-up issues and ultimately get this behind both of us.","And the way I view it is any time we have an engagement with a customer, it\u2019s an opportunity to improve our relationship. So, I view everything we\u2019ve done to-date with GM as being extremely seamlessly between the two companies and because it\u2019s been a difficult situation obviously, but I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in terms of getting the products to the marketplace and we are going to continue to ramp it up and get it behind us.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","","Okay, excellent. Good to hear. And then just last question on the net performance\/other line in your EBITDA lock, it looks like it was about $17 million this quarter. So is this the first quarter, I guess, now that does include synergies related to MVL, but it does not include like the higher income associated with the base MVL business, I guess? I mean, just how should we think about this line kind of evolving in 2014 in light of that?","Kevin P. Clark","You\u2019re right. It does not include the baseline and the outperformance. It would include standard operating performance, which would include material cost savings, manufacturing productivity, SG&A productivity, things - items like that, as well as restructuring benefits and synergy-related programs from MVL.","And you should assume that over the year, we\u2019ve offset price with performance, so we\u2019re going to spend a little bit of that performance, to invest a little of that performance in incremental advanced engineering and IT to the tune of about $100 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","I guess, one thing just on the guidance like, if I'm not mistaken, you beat sort of the numbers you put out there for the first quarter by, I think, $0.14. I think if I look at the full year, you are sort of raising the bottom end by ten and raising the top end by five. So, I think some of this might have been answered in an earlier question, maybe Rod had asked it. But can you just kind of tell us like, why aren't we -- I mean, the outlook seems to be better on the margin. Why aren't we sort of raising the whole year by the beat or more?","Kevin P. Clark","This is Kevin. I\u2019ll start. Starting with revenue, when you look at the overall environment, we\u2019d agree that Western Europe is stabilizing, but Eastern Europe is actually deteriorating. Brazil is significantly deteriorating. And there is really no change to North America and to China. So, if you look at year-over-year growth and you look at global production units in the back half of this year, it\u2019s actually come down relative to where it was in February when we gave guidance for the first quarter and full year.","So, we would say there are actually certain markets that are actually being impacted negatively, most notably Brazil for us. When you look at -- so that\u2019s the revenue line. When you look at from an earnings line and EPS line, knocking off the easy ones, the insurance settlement that I talked about that happened in the first quarter, we originally expected that to get done and negotiated in the second quarter.","So that\u2019s just re-timing and that\u2019s roughly worth $0.03 to $0.04. During the first quarter, there was roughly, I mentioned, $12 million to $14 million of FX and commodity benefits. Based on our outlook for where copper is going to go and where the euro kind of end the year, we don\u2019t see that repeating and quite frankly we see it reversing in the back of the year. So, we\u2019ll give some of that back. So those are the big reconciling items, Patrick, that I hope will answer that question.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","I guess sort of just related, on the powertrain side, you were talking about sort of a second half inflection happening within that segment. Can we just go over the line items that are kind of driving that change in direction first-half to second-half?","Kevin P. Clark","From a revenue standpoint?","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Yes.","Kevin P. Clark","It\u2019s really the introduction of -- on the powertrain business, it\u2019s the introduction or ramp-up of both light-duty diesel programs, as well as heavy-duty diesel programs, primarily in Europe. On the aftermarket -- from an aftermarket standpoint, which is included in that segment, some new programs or business wins that the aftermarket business has won and they will begin shipping. And then thirdly on the gas side of the powertrain business, there is the continued ramp up of gas-direct injection in North America, as well as Europe.","Rodney O'Neal","And we also will have completed some of the ramp downs of some of the outgoing business.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","And just last one from me on that. I think before you had been expecting diesel mix to be kind of a flat assumption sort of year-on-year, maybe slightly adverse in the first half and positive in the second half kind of a wash for the full year. It sounds like that is coming in better, right? Is that -- would that be a fair characterization?","Kevin P. Clark","It\u2019s coming in about where we expected. It\u2019s about what we expected.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital","Maybe just a little bit more color on Europe since we seem to head back there a little bit. I know you said on the plus-2% that was sort of dragged down versus by the aftermarket, so maybe optically versus what production was there, it doesn't look as good. How big is that European aftermarket business? And maybe can you give a sense of what your European OE business did in the quarter?","Kevin P. Clark","","European OE business in Europe was up slightly. Aftermarket business, it\u2019s about 40% of a $1.2 billion business, so a little over $400 million or $450 million. That was down double digits.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital","And then, Rodney, maybe just going back to the bookings question, the confidence in the full year. I know we just sort of went through the China auto show and I think, historically, a good amount of business is done there. Is there any -- obviously, when you come into the first quarter bookings, I don't believe, so is there any color you can provide from that show?","Rodney O'Neal","None other than the confirmation that the market continues to evolve more upscale as with more highly contented vehicles as we said it would. And just renewed confidence, it\u2019s ability to actually grow in terms of the units and growing content over the next three years where that marketplace is going to go from roughly 20 million to 30 million, I think it\u2019s just confirmation that we\u2019ve got it right.","So, we\u2019re excited about what\u2019s going on there and the pace of change into our space not only from the international players, but from the local Chinese players continues to accelerate. So, we\u2019re pretty excited about China.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital","And maybe if I could sneak one more in. On the M&A market, it seemed -- at the Analyst Day, it seemed like you guys were hinting that maybe that market is loosening up a little bit. Is there any further progress you can report? I mean, what sort of confidence do you -- or can you assign any probability to actually being able to do something by the end of the year?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. It\u2019s Kevin. Listen, I think it\u2019s a fair question. I think it is very difficult to assign a probability to a transaction, you need agreement between a buyer and a seller, it\u2019s tough. I\u2019d say our level of activity still is very strong. So, we\u2019ll see.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital","","Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Kevin P. Clark","One question, I would want to clarify, Joe, on your question, I gave you an annualized automotive aftermarket number for Europe, so I want to make sure that you didn\u2019t believe that was the quarterly revenue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lim from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","David Lim - Wells Fargo Securities","Just a question more on the longer term. I mean, with the emissions control or emissions situation in China, and apparently more interest in electric vehicles, can you sort of talk about where you guys are positioned with China electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles over there?","Rodney O'Neal","We\u2019ve got technology on the ground there actually in vehicles, but when you look at the growth rate in that space of pure electrics, it sort of played out there as it has here and really everywhere in the world, it\u2019s just hasn\u2019t gotten the traction thought it would. That being said, though, when you look at the quality of the air that the Chinese government is now beginning to deal with, the huge and most call it the medium to short-term impact, I think it\u2019s going to have to be dealt with more conventional technologies.","And as a result of that, I believe, we\u2019re going to see more advancement on one, the scrapping of older injection type of technologies that are in the fleet and the introduction and we\u2019re seeing it now both on commercial vehicles, as well as on light-duty of very contemporized injection systems, including GDI and common rail. And so, the EV in China is playing out really very similar to how it\u2019s going on here.","David Lim - Wells Fargo Securities","Is the Chinese government being more aggressive with their regulations? I mean, we've always -- all of us already sort of heard that they've always been pushing back, pushing back. But has that changed any in the last couple of months?","Rodney O'Neal","I wouldn\u2019t say the last couple of months. I think what we\u2019re seeing is that they are now putting together what I would call a very comprehensive policy to address that issue. And that issue actually, every developing nation, including ourselves and Europe, have gone through the emergence always had to deal with the pollution issue, not only air, but water, et cetera, as it\u2019s industrialized.","And so what you\u2019re seeing in these emerging countries as it rises its middle-class, is the need for the environment to be protective. And so I think they\u2019re just at that inflection point where it has to be dealt with, if they are to continue to progress more in terms of improving the quality of life for the people.","As a result of that, the policies have to put in place from a government perspective and that\u2019s beginning to be shaped. But right now, I would say it\u2019s still in the formation period and it\u2019s not really what I would call totally nailed down.","I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that it\u2019s going to be a multifaceted approach and the scrappage of -- and just staying with auto, the scrappage of polluting-type vehicles with old technology is an obvious no-brainer, that\u2019s going to get dealt with and then the introduction of cleaner, higher-tech injection systems is going to come too as it relates to Delphi\u2019s position. There is tons of other things that we could get into that - I don\u2019t think they are relevant, but the movement from coal to other cleaner technologies, they\u2019ve got a lot of things they got to deal with.","David Lim - Wells Fargo Securities","And then one last question from me and more near home, when we look at US production rates, I think it peaked in the early 2000's at 17.5 million, what are your thoughts about us returning to that kind of level of production? And what's the propensity or the chance that we could actually exceed the prior peak? Thank you.","Rodney O'Neal","I think there is a steady cadence north, but I don\u2019t see abating. What the ultimate maximization is, I think it depends on things really on a lot of issues, macro et cetera, but really to get back to the 17, 18 million, I see it as not only probable, but almost momentum will get you there. Whether it gets to 20 and 21, I think depends on a lot of things. To answer your question, I think that we would get back to the 08\u2019, 07\u2019 types of levels.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc","I was hoping to talk first on sales growth. You talked about it outperforming the market production-wise by about 1%. Based on your backlog, less pricing, it seems like this year, you're looking to outperform the market by, give or take, kind of 3% or more, something along those lines. And then if I look at your longer-term expectations of outperforming the market by 5%, I was hoping you kind of just reconciled what appears to be maybe a little bit of underperformance relative to the full-year expectations in the first quarter, is there some expectation, some acceleration due to some product launches as you move through the year?","Kevin P. Clark","It\u2019s Kevin. I\u2019ll go with that. Our revenue growth for the first quarter is exactly as we expected it to be and communicated. Our guidance was you\u2019d see accelerated growth throughout the year relative to market. But we\u2019ve grown 3 points over the market in 2014. We\u2019ll grow north of 3 points over the market in 2015, \u201816 and beyond. What\u2019s going to drive that growth is the ramp up of the new business wins that we had over the last number of years, those new program launches.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc","Okay, excellent.","Kevin P. Clark","Revenue for the quarter came -- they came in exactly in line with what our expectations were. Mix was a little bit different with South America being a little bit weaker, but in the aggregate, it all netted out exactly where we expected it to be.","Brett Hoselton - KeyBanc","Now switching gears and just asking about capital deployment, if I take your $3.25 billion capital deployment and that's obviously M&A and share repurchase mix, I divide it by 12 quarters over the next three years, I get to $271 million per quarter. And you've kind of been running your share repurchase activity kind of around $90 million to $160 million per quarter. And so, how do we think about that, how much dry powder you're going to keep for M&A versus share repurchases? Should we be modeling some increases in share repurchase activity as we move through the next year or two? Or should we just kind of think, look, $90 million to $160 million is kind of the range, and you're probably going to make some acquisitions along the way?","Kevin P. Clark","Listen, I would -- that\u2019s a great question, it\u2019s a fair question. It\u2019s tough one to answer on some respect. I think, first, when you look at free cash flow and use of cash, you need to include dividends in that number and you should assume that dividend growth is roughly equal to earnings growth.","Two, as it relates to the trade-off between share repurchases and M&A, it is very difficult again to predict the pace of M&A activity, size of M&A activity. So I think that\u2019s a bit challenging. My preference quite frankly at the end of the day is that analysts wouldn\u2019t factor share repurchases into the NOI number, but I know that\u2019s something that most of you aren\u2019t comfortable doing.","So, I think a reasonable approach is to assume that we continue at the pace we\u2019ve bought back historically with some upside EPS accretion from M&A opportunities. But if you think you\u2019re not comfortable with that, you should take free cash flow less dividend and dividend growth and apply it to repurchases and assume it\u2019s more back-half loaded in a year than it is front-half loaded just given our seasonality of our cash flow.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Your line is now open.","Colin Langan - UBS","Just overall, your prior guidance was based on global production up three and now it's flat, but your sales guidance seems to be the same. Why are you confident that sales are unchanged?? Is it just your lower exposure to South America?","Kevin P. Clark","Well, just to clarify, our outlook for full year global production is that the market is up two versus three. It\u2019s just to make sure -- I wanted to make sure you had that number right or we communicated it correctly. When you look at our overall growth rate over market, it remains unchanged versus our prior guidance, so roughly 3 points.","If you look at where FX rates were in the first quarter, we benefit a bit from where they were in the first quarter and where they are effectively to-date. We see that swinging in the back half of the year and somewhat in the back end. So that\u2019s the reason for that change I referenced.","Colin Langan - UBS","And when we look at Electronics and Safety, the margin there looks like a record margin, anything unique going on in the quarter that helped that segment out or is this a new run-rate?","Kevin P. Clark","","And you\u2019re talking about the EEA?","Colin Langan - UBS","E&S.","Kevin P. Clark","E&S is a segment where we\u2019ve seen consistent margin improvement is really strong operating performance primarily on the material and manufacturing side. And again it\u2019s the rotation of the business to more of a software model versus a historical mechanical model. So it\u2019s the nature of the business.","Colin Langan - UBS","So this level we think is a good run rate or is there something unique going on?","Kevin P. Clark","Our guidance for the business is it continues north from a long-term margin expansion standpoint.","Colin Langan - UBS","And then lastly --.","Kevin P. Clark","Margins will increase just to be clear. We think margins will continue to increase.","Colin Langan - UBS","And then on thermal, there seemed to be a very large quarter-over-quarter improvement. Is that restructuring ahead of schedule or any color there?","Kevin P. Clark","Thermal is in line with our expectations. You\u2019re talking about revenue growth. Margins are actually down on a year-over-year basis. They\u2019re up sequentially second straight quarter, so it\u2019s performing in line with our expectations. The revenue growth reflects the new business wins they have rolling on.","Colin Langan - UBS","But the quarter-over-quarter improvement that -- what was driving that?","Kevin P. Clark","Revenue growth, new business wins.","Colin Langan - UBS","","So there\u2019s the margins --.","Rodney O'Neal","We just had better execution.","Kevin P. Clark","Just to be clear, maybe we should talk about thermal. Thermal margins quarter-on-quarter, year-over-year are down. They are up sequentially. What\u2019s driving the sequential improvement is better operating performance and volume.","Operator","That concludes the Q&A portion of today\u2019s conference, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jessica Holscott.","Jessica L. Holscott","Great. Thanks for participating in today\u2019s call. As always, we\u2019ll be available for any additional questions you may have after the call today.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Elena Rosman, Delphi's Vice President of Investor Relations. Elena, you may begin your conference.","Elena D. Rosman - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thank you, Good morning, Kayla, and thank you to everyone for joining Delphi's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. To follow along with today's presentation, our slides can be found at dephi.com under the investor's section of the website. Consistent with prior calls, today's review of our actual and forecasted financials exclude restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations of Delphi. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included at the back of today's presentation and the Press Release. Please see slide two for disclosure on forward-looking statements, which reflect Delphi's current view of future financial performance, which may be materially different from our actual performance for reasons cited in our form 10-K.","Joining us today will be Kevin Clark, Delphi's President and CEO, and Joe Massaro, CFO and Senior Vice President. As seen on slide three, Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business and then Joe will cover the financial results and our outlook for 2017 in more detail. With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Kevin Clark.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'm going to begin by providing some highlights from the second quarter and then spend some time discussing our portfolio of advanced technologies. Joe will then take you through our detailed financial results for the quarter and outlook for the third quarter and full year, as well as provide an update on the status of the spinoff of our Powertrain segment into a new independent company.","So, let's begin with the highlights on slide five. Our second quarter financial results reflect continued momentum of the positive trends we've experienced over the last few quarters, including mid single digit revenue growth translating into strong growth over market, solid margin expansion, while continuing to invest in strategic growth initiatives, demonstrating the benefits of our industry-leading cost structure and strong new business wins, driven by our portfolio of key technologies. Based on our year-to-date operating results, we're raising our guidance for the full year. Joe will walk you through the details in a few minutes. Additionally, we're pleased with the progress we've made on the spin transaction, which we expect to take place by the end of the first quarter of 2018.","Turning now to slide six. The transformation of the automotive industry continues to dominate the news, with increased focus on safety, connectivity, electrification, and automation, all of which are at the heart of our strategy. Customers are increasingly looking to Delphi to solve their toughest challenges. And as you can see from the headlines on this slide, our technologies are front and center. Volvo's recent announcement to include electrification on all of their vehicles beginning in 2019 is another great example of the industry's accelerating shift to electrification.","The unveiling of the new Audi A8 last month, the first semi-automated vehicle, is moving into production with Level 3 functionality through Audi's Traffic Jam Pilot feature. Delphi's zFAS multi-domain controller for the Audi A8 is the most powerful centralized computing platform in production today, enabling A8 drivers to give up vehicle control at speeds of up to 60 kilometers per hour. ADAS, infotainment and autonomous driving features are requiring more software, more signal distribution, and more compute power, and Delphi's uniquely positioned as the only provider of both the brain and the nervous system of the vehicle with the software and systems integration capabilities which are critical to seamlessly delivering these advanced automotive grade solutions.","As highlighted on slide seven, our portfolio of advanced technologies is in fact driving revenue growth today. Beginning with RemainCo on the left, active safety remains on pace for over 50% growth in 2017 and is expected to continue at that pace into 2018, driven by the combination of increased penetration with existing customers, conquest wins with new customers, and further penetration in less mature markets. Infotainment and user experience is expected to grow 15% to 20% in both 2017 and 2018, benefiting from the market shift to medium and high end infotainment systems, which is our sweet spot, as well as an acceleration in the adoption of advanced cockpit controllers to enable improved graphics performance, greater computational power, and support for multiple displays.","An industry-leading portfolio of high margin engineered components positions us to grow faster than both the market and our competitors, and high voltage electrification is on pace to grow 45% in 2017 and actually accelerate in 2018, reflecting the growth in high voltage electrical architecture that is necessary to support the increased demand for Powertrain electrification.","Turning to the right side of the slide and the Powertrain business, our power electronics product line has revenues totaling $150 million today and is currently growing at a compound rate of 25% and will meaningfully accelerate in 2018, driven by the roughly $4 billion of new business bookings. GDI and variable valvetrain have each grown to roughly $350 million in revenues and continue to track at a solid mid-teens growth rate and heavy duty and medium duty diesel revenues are currently increasing at a rate of over 20% driven by improving conditions in the commercial vehicle market, and the work that our Powertrain team has done to further penetrate strong global customers. So in summary, our portfolio of advanced technologies, which represents over 35% of our current revenues, are growing mid teens, which should continue to 2018 and beyond.","As you can see on slide eight, we've broken out new business bookings for both RemainCo and the Powertrain business and further highlighted some of our key growth technologies. For RemainCo, the active safety, infotainment, and user experience and high voltage electronics bookings are accelerating, increasing at just under a 30% growth rate since 2011, totaling $25 billion of lifetime revenues, and representing more than 25% of total bookings. Active safety bookings have increased at a compound rate of 50% since 2011 and the $2 billion of year-to-date bookings have already surpassed 2016 total active safety bookings of $1.4 billion.","Infotainment and user experience bookings have increased over 40% in the last year and have increased at a mid-teens compound rate since 2011, reflecting the benefits of new technologies, and share gains with both new and existing customers. And high voltage electrification bookings in our Electrical Architecture business have grown at a 60% compound rate since 2011 and now total almost $4 billion.","RemainCo also continues to benefit from strong bookings in this base business, which includes wire harnesses, connectors, cable management, and electronic controls growing at a compound rate of 5% since 2011 and now totaling $78 billion.","For our Powertrain business, key growth technologies including GDI, variable valvetrain, and power electronics have grown at over a 20% growth rate since 2011, totaling almost $13 billion and representing 30% of total bookings. GDI bookings now total $5.5 billion and have grown at a compound rate of 50% since 2011. Bookings for power electronics have increased off an initial low base and now total almost $4 billion. New business bookings in our Powertrain business have also benefited from $14 billion of cumulative awards from commercial vehicle customers, partially offsetting the slowdown in light duty diesel bookings. Delphi had another great quarter of bookings in the second quarter of this year, bringing our year-to-date total to $14 billion and putting us on a path to finish the year above 2016's record of $26 billion.","Slide nine features just a few of the vehicle electrification and active safety bookings during the quarter. Growth in vehicle electrification results in increased content opportunities for both RemainCo and the Powertrain business. This is exemplified by a significant high voltage conquest award with FAW-VW in China for our Electrical Architecture business and a second major power electronics win with Volvo Geely in our Powertrain business for our new combined inverter DCDC converter with lifetime revenues of over $1 billion, bringing the year-to-date total on this project \u2013 of this product line, rather, and with this customer to almost $2 billion. In addition, we received an active safety award from a large global customer with lifetime revenues well in excess of $1 billion. Each of these bookings highlights the success we've had bringing new advanced technologies to the market.","Now slide ten further underscores that increased Powertrain electrification provides increased content opportunities when compared to low voltage content for Electrical Architecture or the base internal combustion engine content for Powertrain. By 2025, we believe that over 30% of all vehicles produced will include some form of electrification, with roughly half of those utilizing 48-volt technology. And as we've discussed, both the Powertrain business and RemainCo are well positioned to benefit from the trend in electrification, providing strong growth opportunities in the years ahead.","Today, we have roughly $400 million of electrification revenues, which have grown at a compound rate of over 50% per year, but again, off of a fairly low initial base. Approximately $300 million of these revenues are high voltage electrical distribution and connection systems offered through our Electrical Architecture segment, with a balance from the Powertrain electronics products that are a part of our Powertrain segment. We've booked over $7 billion in vehicle electrification programs over the last six years, which we expect will translate into revenue growth in the range of 40% per year over the next few years.","Now turning to slide 11. Our new business awards with Volvo Geely serve as further validation of our vehicle electrification strategy for the China market, the largest electrification market in the world. China's forecasted to lead the global trend in Powertrain electrification, representing over 50% of unit production in 2025, reflecting a 40 fold increase over today's levels. We remain optimistic about the China market as a result of the underlying macro trends which include increased government focus on emissions regulations, which are increasing demand for China's new energy vehicles, increased consumer demand for active safety and infotainment in user experience technologies, and accelerated penetration of higher contented SUVs and luxury vehicles.","As a result of the underlying macro trends in our related business strategy, we've had double digit revenue growth year-to-date roughly eight points above market in China led by roughly 80% growth in GDI, over 60% growth in active safety revenues, and over 20% growth in connectors and cable management revenues. Our record $5 billion of year-to-date bookings in the region reflect a more balanced blend of local Chinese customers, representing two-thirds of the bookings in the region. And as a result, our key growth technologies in China are forecasted to grow over 50% per year for the foreseeable future.","Another example of the work we're doing in this region includes our recent automated ride and drive event found at the (13:16) Shanghai auto show. The event was very well received, as customers and other key stakeholders came away excited about the social and environmental benefits of advanced driver assistance systems.","Moving to slide 12. We're focused on the safe green and connected operations of the vehicle. As we move towards a more connected and automated mobility environment, validating our technology and standing up new mobility solutions, it is going to be critical to providing solutions to our customers and unlocking value for our shareholders. As a result, we're selectively expanding our automated driving pilot programs, which are terrific opportunities to commercialize our autonomous technologies, including automated mobility on demand and data analytic solutions.","Now we've previously discussed our automated mobility on demand taxi service in Singapore's one-north business park. During the quarter, we also announced our Transdev partnership in France, where we'll have several vehicles in operation in 2018. Now as a reminder, Transdev is a leading mobility service provider, operating over 43,000 vehicles in multiple municipalities globally. Our partnership with Transdev will combine their universal routing engine and remote control command software with Delphi's centralized sensing localization and planning automated driving platform, which we're developing in partnership with Mobileye and Intel. We believe this partnership will help accelerate the development of a robust automated vehicle solution and provides a clear path to commercialization.","We're also pleased to announce that we have reached agreement on a smart city pilot with the city of Boston. Leveraging our activities in Singapore and France, we're collaborating with Transdev in Boston to develop a commercially viable service with similar Level 5 operations, fleet management, and mobility cloud services.","We're also partnering with AT&T in Boston to provide vehicle to infrastructure solutions that demonstrate the value of vehicle data analytics for efficient city operations and equitable access to mobility. As part of the combined efforts with Transdev and AT&T, we'll be establishing a local software development presence in Boston, which will provide us with further access to top engineering talent in critical fields, such as data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.","These pilots collectively underscore the broader momentum in our autonomous driving and smart city collaborations. We look forward to further highlighting our strategy and technology road maps during our Investor Day on September 27 in Boston.","Joe will take you through the details of that event later, and I look forward to seeing many of you there. With that I'll hand the call over to Joe to take us through the second quarter results and our updated outlook for 2017. Great, Joe.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Slide 14 provides a summary of our second quarter financial performance. Organic revenue growth of 5% was led by strong growth in E&S and Powertrain, despite a declining market this quarter. Our EBITDA margins expanded 20 basis points on a pro forma basis to 17.7%, and operating margins also expanded 20 basis points to 13.6%. Earnings per share grew 13%, primarily due to year-over-year operating income growth and the lower tax rate. We generated operating cash flow of approximately $600 million, an increase of 8% from prior year levels. And we returned $173 million of cash to shareholders, including $95 million of share repurchases.","Turning to slide 15, let's look at revenue in the quarter in greater detail. Beginning with the walk on the left, on a pro forma basis excluding Mechatronics, price downs of 1.9% and FX and commodity headwinds of $47 million came in better than expected. Adjusted sales growth of 5%, well above the 1.5% decline in global vehicle production for the quarter, was driven by Europe and Asia, including strong active safety growth and new infotainment launches in E&S, accelerating gas and commercial vehicle volumes in North America and China in our Powertrain business.","South America was up over 15% in the quarter, albeit off a relatively low base. And North America revenue was flat, reflecting a 3% market decline. Growth in Electrical Architecture was negatively impacted by tough year-over-year comparisons, including the impact of lower FCA volumes from the previously discussed program cancellations, as well as production ramp downs and certain new model transitions.","Turning to operating income growth. Slide 16 walks the year-over-year change in the quarter. Operating income was $587 million, and operating margins were 13.6%, up 20 basis points adjusting for the sale of Mechatronics. Strong volume flow-through and positive net performance was partially offset by FX and commodity headwinds. Overall, another quarter of strong year-over-year performance having lapped certain operational challenges we had last year.","Turning to the segments on slide 17, let's start with Electrical Architecture on the left. Sales were flat in the quarter, as mid-single digit growth in our connector and cable management product lines and 44% growth in high voltage electrification was offset by the previously mentioned program cancellations and OEM production cuts. Electrical Architecture margins declined 50 basis points as a result of flat sales, combined with launch costs in the quarter associated with planned second half launches.","Moving to Electronics and Safety, adjusted revenue grew 19% in the quarter, driven by new infotainment launches and higher penetration of active safety products. As Kevin referenced, our strong win rates and bookings in active safety continues to give us confidence in the outlook for 50% plus active safety growth this year and next.","E&S margins were 11.2%, down 10 basis points versus the prior year, as strong volume flow-through was offset by increased investments in automated driving, which accounted for approximately 100 basis points of margin in the quarter. We remain on track with our original automated driving spending plan for the year of $50 million to $60 million and expect the cost to ramp in the second half of 2017.","Powertrain delivered 7% organic growth with strong double digit gains in power electronics, gas direct injection, and commercial vehicles. Powertrain margins expanded 200 basis points due to strong volume flow-through and benefits from prior period restructuring actions.","Our full year Powertrain outlook continues to contemplate a mid-single digit decline in light duty diesel revenues, which is being more than offset by strong double digit growth in GDI, commercial vehicles, and power electronics, giving us confidence in our outlook for mid-single digit organic growth overall.","In summary, all of our businesses delivered above market growth and performed at or better than expectations, despite a more challenging macro environment.","Slide 18 walks our EPS year-over-year, which grew 13% versus Q2 2016, driven by organic sales growth, a lower year-over-year tax rate, lower interest expense from last year's debt refinancing, and a lower share count. As a result, EPS was $0.06 higher versus the midpoint of our guidance range.","Slide 19 provides an update on key macros, reflected in our updated full year outlook. Relative to our prior guidance, we're seeing faster growth in active safety, infotainment, and GDI, as recent launches with new customers have been strong and we expect this activity to continue through 2017 and into next year. FX and commodities are also driving high reported revenues, particularly the strengthening euro, which we initially planned at $1.05. Our second half estimate now assumes the euro at $1.08 reflecting levels similar to what we saw in the first half.","Moving to the right side, we remain mindful of certain cautionary indicators which we believe could put pressure on production in the second half. We have reflected these in our latest outlook for the year, which now includes a 2% decline in North America production from 2016 levels, versus our initial estimate of flat. As a result, our view of global vehicle production is that it will now be down slightly for the year, representing a decrease of approximately 1% from our prior expectations. As we have consistently demonstrated, we are relentlessly focused on improving our cost structure and can quickly flex in response to varying market conditions. For example, we've proactively targeted $20 million in annual cost savings to help mitigate the impact of lower volumes in North America and will begin taking actions in the second half of 2017.","Turning to slide 20. We've provided our guidance for the third quarter and updated outlook for the year. The third quarter outlook reflects $4.05 billion of revenue at the midpoint, up approximately 3% organic or 3.5 points above market, driven by double digit growth in E&S and mid single digit growth in Powertrain, offsetting weaker North American production, which is primarily impacting Electrical Architecture. Margins are expected to be up approximately 30 basis points, reflecting continued volume growth in operating performance, partially offset by the previously mentioned ramp in automated driving investments in E&S.","Earnings are expected to be the in the range of $1.52 to $1.58 per share, up 8% at the midpoint. Revenues for the year are now expected in the range of $16.85 billion to $17.05 billion, $250 million higher at the midpoint. Adjusted operating income is now expected to be $2.27 billion at the midpoint, with margins up approximately 20 to 30 basis points year-over-year. Earnings per share are now expected in the range of $6.55 to $6.75, a $0.10 increase at the midpoint, driven by higher operating income and the benefit of a slightly lower tax rate. Cash flow guidance now reflects the July payment to settle the unsecured creditors' litigation of $310 million and is expected to be $1.85 billion net of that payment. In summary, we are confident in our raised outlook for the year, reflecting strong sales growth and operational performance, versus the original guidance we said earlier this year.","Turning to slide 21, for a brief update on the status of the Powertrain spin transaction. As we discussed last quarter, the outcome of the separation will be two independent and well positioned companies. Since the announcement in early May, we have filed our draft form 10 and completed our initial assessments of capital structure planning. We are pleased with the progress made to date and the team remains on track to complete the spinoff by March 2018, as planned. In the meantime, both teams are executing well and are excited to share their visions for the future at the upcoming investor conference on September 27 in Boston. There, we will provide a more in depth review of both RemainCo and SpinCo as well as informative discussions around our technology road maps and long-term planning frameworks. And as always, we will be featuring some of our latest innovations. I'd like to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks, Joe. Let me summarize on slide 22 before opening the call to Q&A. We delivered another solid quarter, driven by continued strong demand for our industry leading technologies and solid operating execution. This positive momentum gives us confidence in our increased guidance for the full year, which reflects the strength of our first half financial results. We continue to work tirelessly on increasing the efficiency and the flexibility of our cost structure and have been focused on positioning our business for the future as we work towards completing the spinoff of the Powertrain business.","We're encouraged by the overwhelmingly positive feedback from customers, from partners, and from our employees that we've received since announcing the spinoff transaction, which reinforces the industrial logic and the significant growth opportunities on the horizon for both companies. Each company will benefit from strong foundations of industry-leading advanced technologies, favorably aligned to evolving industry trends, each with increased flexibility to pursue strategies that will better position them to solve their customers' biggest challenges, resulting in accelerated revenue and earnings growth and increased shareholder value. We look forward to sharing more with you on that front at our upcoming Investor Day on September 27.","So with that, I'm sure there's some question. Let's open up the line, operator, to Q&A, please.","Elena D. Rosman - Delphi Automotive Plc","Great. Kayla, we'll now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Rob (sic) [Rod] (27:00) Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Morning.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I just had a couple questions. One is if you could just clarify the outlook for the second half in the Electrical Architecture business. Is that headwind still going to continue through the end of the year from some of the canceled contracts? And also on the Electronics and Safety business, obviously phenomenal growth but there are some costs that you're incurring in R&D and presumably other places. If you can just give us a sense of what the underlying conversion is or what some of those headwinds are.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Go ahead, Joe.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, Rod, so yeah. I think when we talk about Electrical Architecture, there's a couple things. We obviously had been discussing some pass car cancellations in last year as we set guidance that primarily impacted that business. We're continuing to see softness in pass car in North America, some in the first half. We expect a little more in the second half. And then we're going through two fairly significant truck\/SUV launches at the moment that will really come in in 2018, so we've sort of got the cost and on one of them, the wind-down of the older model to deal with this year and the expected ramp coming next year.","So with respect to revenue, would expect that business to, primarily because it's North America and the items I just discussed, have similar to slightly down revenue for the balance of the year. We will see margin expansion for the year though in that business. They've done a nice job with performance so we're still expecting that business to be up about 30 basis points of margin on a year-over-year basis. So, this quarter a little flat just given the timing of some of the production cuts versus some of the launch cost, but on a full year basis, still expect margins to expand 30 basis points.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","And do you want to talk about investment in automated driving in E&S?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Sure. So we're still on track for the $50 million to $60 million for the year. We see that ramping in the back half of the year. So about 60% of it will be spent in the back half. That's what you see coming out in the E&S margin. And in Q2 that was worth, as I mentioned, about 100 basis points of margin expansion in the E&S basis.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thank you. And just lastly, on the Powertrain business, any initial thoughts on expected capital structure for the SpinCo and do you think you can sustain that kind of mid single digit growth rate even with maybe some stronger headwinds from diesel going forward?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, let's hit the growth rate first. Mid single digit growth is where we see this business, so between 4% and 6% over the next couple of years. Again, strong trajectory on the gas technology businesses and the power electronics, helped by commercial vehicles certainly this year. Also, light duty diesel still down about 3%, so from what we're seeing, very consistent with our guide on that, and would not expect that to change.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, Rod, if I can chime in on the growth piece, to Joe's point. We've talked about light duty diesel and obviously that's a headwind. So we have just under $1 billion of light duty diesel business. About $600 million of that is specific to light duty diesel in Europe. We see that declining. Joe talked about the light duty diesel growth rate, but declining at low to mid single digits over the next couple years in Europe, which basically equates to a call it a $300 million headwind as it relates to light duty diesel.","We think there's a portion of that light-duty diesel business that continues to grow outside of Europe or within Europe and globally on light commercial vehicles. And then as we've said, we've seen strong growth in heavy duty diesel, medium duty diesel and certainly Powertrain electrification that's more than offset the headwind related to light duty diesel.","With respect to Powertrain and capital structure, and Joe should chime in on this. Listen. Our capital allocation strategy as a company we think is best in class. We think it's served us well and we would expect the Powertrain business to continue with a very similar strategy on a go-forward base.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, Rod, and over the course of the quarter, we have firmed up discussions with rating agencies and such. And so consistent I think with our initial thoughts, this would be a high-quality sub investment grade sort of call it BB type company, across the board from the agencies, very much aligned with expectations and we'd expect RemainCo post spin to hold this ratings.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So consistent leverage on both sides or is there ...","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. Yep, no, it's going to be \u2013 sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. It's going to be a left pocket, right pocket. So I would think both of them, think both businesses right around two times leverage and just basically shifting the burden, the debt burden to Powertrain commensurate with the EBITDA move over.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Morning, Joe.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I guess just thanks for all the additional color on the segment puts and takes for the back half, but just to summarize the lower top end of the organic growth guidance, it sounds like that is really just related to sort of the lower overall industry volume. Is that a fair assumption?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yes.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So like really the rest of the stuff was mostly expected?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. No, I think that's the right assumption, Joe, and it's mostly North America.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","And it's two things. We've got a big truck\/SUV transition we're working through and I think we've mentioned before in the past, that's going to be lumpy quarter to quarter, but we're on the old platform and we're on the new platform. So we may bounce a little bit from a quarter to quarter perspective, but we'll come out in a very good place on the new platform. We've got another large truck launch that's going to hit in 2018 in that Electrical Architecture business, so we were working through that. I think what we're now seeing is just slowdown in North American pass car. I think a couple of the OEs have talked about it last week. We went from Q2 what I'd call normal levels of summer shutdowns and we're starting to see increased and have been notified of increased shutdowns. And again, I think this is all public in terms of what they're talking about. That's basically what we're reflecting in that revenue guide.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, perfect. And then on the \u2013 I thought the disclosure on the bookings growth certainly by RemainCo and SpinCo was pretty interesting. I mean, it seems like what you're classifying as growth in \u2013 growth in key technologies is actually, looks like a bigger part of, on a percent basis anyway, in Powertrain versus RemainCo. As we think about those two companies going forward, is there going to be greater catch up in RemainCo? And is part that just because you're counting that since 2011 and some of the more electrification and active safety efforts are more recent?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, Joe, listen, I think it underscores, quite frankly, the strength of that Powertrain business. And it gets back to the question that Rod asked with respect to capital structure, right? That, at the end of the day, what's important for us is that we position this business to pursue the opportunities that are in front of it, to appropriately serve its customers and to invest. And there's some terrific opportunities on the side of GDI and variable valvetrain and power electronics and others that are really going to drive growth there.","As it relates to RemainCo, similarly, RemainCo is a larger base number in absolute terms. So you got to be a bit careful of the percentages. But when you look at the growth opportunities in active safety, 50% plus; when you look at infotainment growth in the area of 15% to 20%; when you look at high voltage electrification on the Electrical Architecture side at extremely strong; and then Engineered Components growth, you have very, very solid growth businesses within each business' portfolio.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then, Joe, one quick housekeeping. I think in the quarter there was, to get back to the adjusted number, the $17 million reserve for unsecured creditors. And I think that was a positive in the first quarter and then reversal this quarter. So was that just sort of timing or with something coming a little bit sooner?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","I think it's the other way around, Joe. We had originally accrued a higher number, just based on our estimate.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","And then the settlement of $310 million was a little bit better than that. So you see the $17 million coming back in the second quarter.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, no, that's what I meant. Sorry if I said it backwards. Yep, thanks.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Leiker from Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Morning, David.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Kevin, if you could \u2013 Audi A8, we've been talking about that for a while and the zFAS controller on that and Delphi's involvement with it. I don't know that there's been a discussion of everything that you're doing on that vehicle, and in particular everything that the zFAS controller is responsible for. Could you flesh that out a little bit?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, I can walk through that. So listen, we've had a long-term relationship with Audi, as you know. We've been working on the zFAS controller with them over the last couple years. As you know, it just launched and will continue to launch over the next year or so.","And when you look at it, there's both what we call a zFAS light as well as a zFAS high-end configuration. So the light basically reflecting Level 2, the higher end reflecting Level 3. Content on it includes a driver's state sensor module. It includes camera envisioning technology. It includes a controller itself. It includes radar technology, ultrasonic sensing, as well as some of our connections in Electrical Architecture systems. So it's a very robust, very robust product.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. And then on a different note, as you're going across the two businesses, I know there's a lot of talk in the industry of disrupters coming into the space, particularly from a Tier 1 perspective. Can you talk if you're seeing any changes in that competitive landscape, if there's anybody new coming in there or anybody dropping off?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","And you're talking about specifically as it relates to multi-domain controllers?","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Well, no, really across the business. There's an argument out there that the tech companies are going to come and take over all the work for the Tier 1s and because the in-depth (39:04) technologies reside with the Tier 1s.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, listen, I'm \u2013 yeah, and I'm familiar with that argument. And listen, a number of those players who are allegedly coming in and taking over the industry or coming into the industry are, quite frankly, partners that we do business with. I think one of the recognitions from both the technology players outside of the industry as well as the industry itself is the complexity of performance, complexity of quality, the complexity related to how you need to architect a vehicle to do all the things that the industry and consumers are asking a vehicle to have, whether it be autonomous driving or active safety or infotainment or more clusters in a car. All that requires more signal distribution, higher compute powers.","And those are areas where typically those players don't have those capabilities. Players like us do.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Right.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","I would say, to be candid with you, that is a space where actually, based on our dialogue with customers, we're seeing less or fewer competitors. And that if you're not a player who has a meaningful position in areas like active safety today, which we think the incremental benefit of being in the Electrical Architecture business puts us in a very, very unique position, that it's really an area that's overly complex and too difficult to get into, because you're really talking about the underlying architecture of the vehicle. And that's something that, David, that we'll quite frankly talk \u2013 you'll hear us talk more and more about, including at the Investor Day in September.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great, thank you. Good morning. Just going back to the second half organic growth, Joe. Could you maybe share what Delphi's North America revenue and how that splits between cars and light truck segments? And then kind of how you see your North America production second half relative to Delphi's North America revenue second half?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, so, Itay, we're in North America, HolCo is about 65% SUV\/truck versus pass car. So we work very hard to position that, the business in that way over the last few years. And that continues to hold and hold well.","Bookings, quite honestly is probably actually a little stronger than that, as you look out over a couple of the truck programs we're launching. So that looks good. I think as we think about the North American market for the year, we're thinking, as I mentioned, it's down two points for the year. Delphi revenue growth, I would call it 2.5 points above market. So, half a point to a little bit better than that.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great, that's helpful. Then, as a follow-up, maybe for Kevin on slide 12. When we think about Delphi's role in the future of automated mobility on demand, how should we think about the different opportunities you have, both the vehicle, of course, and Level 4, but also if we think about potential services revenue, fleet management, and kind of how should we divide that up in terms of the long-term opportunity for Delphi?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Well, listen. As we've talked about before, the data opportunity in this industry is huge. And, as an industry, we've just scratched the surface. We think mobility on demand and specifically the business opportunities we have with fleet management firms or what I'd call the mobility on demand providers, put us in a position where there's both opportunity within the vehicle from a data standpoint, but there's also real opportunity outside the vehicle. And those are what we are evaluating now. Those are the reasons why we're doing these smart sitting pilots with a select group of partners. And you'll hear us talk more about our plans as we firm them up.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great, that's all I had. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Ah, yes, two questions. One on the accounting and the other more strategic. Not accounting, on the quarter. Powertrain incremental was very strong, 30%. A couple questions. You mentioned restructuring saves, what quarter do we start lacking those? And second, around Powertrain, to what extent was there good commercial diesel volume? And did that help the incrementals?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Oh, yeah. You want to go ahead?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Brian, I think on the restructuring, we've talked \u2013 that's really for 2017, we would expect the business to be up well over 100 basis points for the year. That's really where the restructuring benefits come into. Next year, we'd expect it to return more to our normal expected margin expansion of call it 20 to 40 basis points. So this is really where you see the year of the step change.","Commercial vehicle revenues were up about 20% in the quarter. Very strong North America helping that. And I actually thinks it's strong North America, but it's also representative of the types of customers we have. We're on very strong global players' global platforms from a CV perspective in that Powertrain business.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Second question is more strategic and sort of a RemainCo opportunity set. Not to focus on Tesla, but I think apart from the marketing and the brand, sort of the whole data architecture, Electrical Architecture, OTA updates, data harvesting, and sending it back to the cloud seems to be ahead of most of the legacy industry. And of course they're out there talking about rather aggressive goals for reducing the complexity of wiring in the cars while increasing the function. Can you give us a sense of a few things in that area? Kind of, one, over time, what's the content opportunity in Delphi when, on the one hand, there's more data, more centralized controllers. On the other hand, is it realistic to think there'll be fewer kilometers of wires?","And then just second, given the big need to re-architect the data and Electrical Architecture of their vehicles, where are the legacy industry on this? And is it becoming more of a priority for them?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, Brian, I think that's a great question. Listen, Tesla, as you know, is an important customer of Delphi. And we're their primary wire harness provider, I would say. So, they're certainly a customer that we're familiar with from a strategy standpoint. I think as it relates to their current dialogue about wire in the car, I mean, the reality is, from a manufacturing standpoint, simplification in automation and a cost standpoint, they're trying to reduce the amount of wire in the car. On the flipside, the number of flux circuits and other cable that's necessary to optimize that, quite frankly, adds content, at least near term. I think as it relates to the dialogue about architecture within the industry, I think it's a dialogue that you're starting to see \u2013 we're starting to have more discussions with principally, as you can imagine, with the European and principally with the European German luxury OEs. And I believe it's really the realization of everything going into the car requires an architecture that is somewhat different. That you optimize signal distribution, that you have more compute power and software is a bigger component of the overall value proposition or what's necessary to drive the technology and drive the capabilities. And that's something we're, quite frankly, beginning with Audi a couple years ago in the zFAS controller. That's something that we're front and center with, with a number of OEs today. And it's, quite frankly, something that we're trying to drive.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And in terms of timing, when those would show up in bookings and eventually in program launches?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Well, listen, I think zFAS the first. We'll have more that'll be coming out in 2019 and beyond. I think, in terms of real meaningful change to the architecture of the car, that's out five-plus years, right? That's as you'll see more adoption of Level III and then ultimately Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous driving. And you'll see more displays, more content go into the infotainment system and into the cockpit.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris McNally from Evercore ISI.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Hey, everyone. Thanks so much.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Morning, Chris.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","My question's around the acceleration of organic and outgrowth from this sort of current 5% level to something better in 2018\/2020, as your key growth drivers become larger portions of the portfolio. And I think you've been pretty explicit with the seven secular drivers from some of the Analyst Days and I really just wanted to drill down into Electrical Architecture, specifically. And kind of my question is, can we get back to this 4% to 5% type organic growth, which it seems to be the drag on the overall top-line. We talked about the truck changeover, but in a 0% production environment, and I guess we're still in the early stages of the EV ramp, is that possible? Or do we have to wait for sort of electrification to be further along to hit sort of that mid single digit for that division?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","No, Chris, we won't wait that long. I mean, even in 2018, you'll see a bump up in growth, just as we get through the truck\/SUV transition and pass car settles out. So, this business, we'll have the growth over market. I think it comes from, in part, from its scale, its platform concentration on higher contented vehicles, Audi Q7's, GM truck SUVs. We'll be launching another big North American truck platform next year. So, that growth will come back in 2018. As I said this for us is the confluence of the truck transition, which we knew about and was factored in, on top of the pass car decline in North America.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Just to be real clear on it. The revenue growth in that business back half is really affected by two discrete items and it's North America specific and it's passenger car specific, and it's truck turnover as they move to a new platform. So, it's very discrete and it's for a very short period time. As you look at 2018, you'll have a business that returns to growing. As we've said historically, roughly two points over market. So, the E\/EA revenue growth for the back half of this year is very discrete.","As it relates to overall accelerated growth over market, listen, I think at Investor Day, and not to steal the thunder, I think you're going to hear us continue to say we've got strong bookings, we're in strong positions. But I think our guidance on a go-forward basis is we're going to continue to commit to roughly five points of growth over market because we don't, in fact, control some of the decisions that OEs make as it relates to production schedules. And we always want be to in a position where, quite frankly, we're not explaining why organic growth isn't as strong, and in a position explaining why it was better than what we originally forecasted.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Kevin, no, that's really clear. I really appreciate it. I mean, should we at least think about, though, if the EA is growing like you said, maybe in a normal environment, which starts next year after the changeovers two points above market. We do get a nice material step up though, as we hit the end of the decade when full EV and plug ins start to take off because of the acceleration and the content per vehicle pickup that you talked about.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, I think if you look at our bookings and growth in bookings on key technologies, you look at revenue growth rate on key technologies both within what will be RemainCo as well as Powertrain, again, I think it's fair to surmise and look at it and say that the profile of both businesses are higher growth. However, having said that, again, we don't control vehicle production schedules by OEs and we want to limit the situation or the risk of ever having to explain to you folks why growth wasn't what we communicated.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, Chris, it's Joe I think ...","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Thanks so much, guys.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Hey, Adam.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, everybody. Thanks, Kevin and Joe. First question, just following up on Tesla. In addition to the wiring harness where you mentioned you're the primary supplier there, can you confirm \u2013 well, first, what else do you do for the Model 3, for example, that you might have disclosed or care to disclose now?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, it's principally Electrical Architecture.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Can you confirm that Elon's comment of taking the wiring length, and I know that's not the only way to judge the value of the system, but let's say the kilometers down by roughly 50% from Model S to Model 3?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, I think they're working to reduce the amount of length. I can confirm that. I'm not going to give specifics as to exactly how much.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. But you also supplied the Model S wiring, as well, correct?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","No, we don't.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I'm just curious, if in an environment where we cut wiring length, are you able to fully offset the value of the Electrical Architecture through the connectors? Or is it kind of more back to even or (54:05)?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, listen, yeah. I think at the end of the day, from an architecture standpoint, we don't just provide wire, right?","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yep.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","So, I think at the end of the day, when you talk about what's going into a vehicle from a complexity standpoint. When you talk about everything that they're putting in from a technology standpoint, the reality is that requires more complex architecture, which is a mix of not only length of wire, but type of wire, whether it's carbon fiber or copper, as well as number of connection points.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","So, as you look at content growth for Delphi on those vehicles over a period of time, with that specific OE, content growth is actually increased from a broad architecture standpoint.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Kevin. And just a couple follow-ups. Foxconn, do you have a relationship with that company right now on the automotive side?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","No, no.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Is there an interest or are there \u2013 I don't know if you can confirm discussions or a feeler or anything else? Could we have a relationship?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Could we have? I guess, in theory, we could have a relationship. I don't have anything to confirm. We don't have a relationship today. But I don't know what your question is alluding to.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, just that Foxconn wants to make cars, according to their chairman, that's all. That they want to supply fleet vehicles. Okay, fine. Then just the last one quick. There's 145,000 employees at RemainCo. What would that number be on a kind of if you were to include the non-consolidated, principally Chinese operations? I didn't know if there was a broader number. I believe that's 145 just the consolidated employees, but what would that be ...","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, no, that's total, Adam. It's Joe. This is for a lot of years. I mean, we're at this point either own or majority control all the operations in China and have fully consolidated them. So that's the all-in number.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Joe. Thanks everybody.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yep.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Hey, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","What spins into the Powertrain business comprise exactly what was in that division prior to the announcement of the spin, or are some product groups that sat in one division or another going to transfer between them, prior to the spin? I ask just, in part, because I wasn't aware, as the takeaway from slide ten seems to imply, that the spin may actually have at least more incremental, you clarified, leverage electrification from the E\/EA business.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Maybe that was always the case and I just underappreciated it.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. No. So no, Ryan it's fine. So not to \u2013 and we maybe caused confusion with people. Quite frankly, the power electronics business, which is Powertrain-specific electrification, so outside of Electrical Architecture, high voltage wiring connectors had historically sat within our E&S business. About a year ago, a little over a year ago, we moved that into our Powertrain business because there was more dialogue with Powertrain experts within our customer base about power electronics. And given that that was where the customer interface moved to, we thought it would best sit within that Powertrain business and that Powertrain segment.","So within Powertrain, you have the traditional Powertrain product line, from a gas fuel injection, diesel fuel injection, and Powertrain products. You have power electronics as well as the aftermarket business, which is principally Powertrain product related.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And power electronics, to be clear, that has relevance not just for electrification of internal combustion engines but for pure electric vehicles, too?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. Correct.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","It's the full product line. So your inverters, converters, battery packs, those types of products.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just finally, in light of all of this leverage we've been talking about to electrification, internal combustion engines of the spin, and also to pure electric vehicles, and then also combined with obviously the diesel headwinds, et cetera, on the light duty side. What are the latest thought in terms of the SpinCo's kind of normalized organic growth relative to light vehicle production?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, I mentioned it earlier. We're high confidence in that mid single digit range. That accounts for light duty diesel deterioration being offset by growth in the heavy duty diesel business, as well as the power electronics and the gas technologies. I think the way to think about it, if you focus on that roughly $950 million of revenue, light duty diesel revenue in Powertrain, about $550 million of that is pass car. So it's a relatively small number when you start to frame it. The rest, light duty diesel's actually commercial vehicle, not under the same types of pressures; sort of what I'll call political and social pressures as light duty diesel pass car. So that $550 million we see coming down and say, it halves over the forecast period. So we can ring fence that revenue leakage. It's a pretty straightforward calculation.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lim from Wells Fargo Securities.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Hey, David.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just quickly, you talk about the SUV transition for you guys. Is the new vehicle that you guys are on or the replacement vehicle, is that of higher content?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","It's a little bit more. Roughly the same, a little bit more.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Gotcha.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","We expect it to grow over its life, too. They typically do. They'll add more content as the vehicle matures.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Gotcha. And then on the power electronics, I think in Q1, you guys mentioned $600 million of wins.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is there a number you guys could offer for Q2? I know you guys gave a lot of numbers, but I just want to be sure what your power electronics wins were in Q2.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, Q2 was strong as well. It was over $1 billion in power electronics bookings.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Gotcha. And then a little bit on the longer term on electrification. I mean, a lot of headlines regarding solid state battery technology and the applications even on the CV side. If there was truly a breakthrough over the next several years, any kind of thoughts on how that would impact your Powertrain business? Or do you see that not happening as rapidly as maybe one would think?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Listen, are you talking about Powertrain electrification? Is the question related ...","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, so like what we're hearing is Toyota's breakthrough on solid state batteries.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Right.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","To really extend the range and reduce the weight. Now if there was truly a breakthrough there, would we see a faster than normal feed shift to electrification, whether that be light vehicle and commercial vehicles? And then the consequential impact on SpinCo, if you would.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, listen, on electrification is good incrementally for both businesses. So let me start with that.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","So both businesses benefit whether it's full EV or it's mild hybrid or it's plug in hybrid. It is a positive trend for both. The content per vehicle opportunity is well in excess of what our average CPV is today on a vehicle, whether it has an internal combustion engine or related to low voltage Electrical Architecture, which is in a standard car.","To the extent vehicle electrification ramps up, it's a net benefit for both businesses. The ability for it to accelerate, there's an opportunity there. But I think you need to think about infrastructure and other things that, quite frankly, will limit the amount of \u2013 or the ability to accelerate things to some certain level.","As it relates to commercial vehicle, our view on electrification and commercial vehicle from an industry standpoint is there's an opportunity there for light commercial vehicle, maybe for last mile on heavy duty commercial vehicle, Class 8 commercial vehicle. But just given the dynamics in that industry and that market, it's going to be a diesel, heavy-duty diesel business for quite a long time.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Gotcha. Great, thank you.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Hey, David.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, how are you doing?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Good.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I think I caught that you mentioned your ADAS bookings being strong year to date at about $2 billion. Is that what I heard?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So that's pretty nice growth and acceleration over the past couple years for about a billion. I think you mentioned last year of $1.8 billion in total.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Are you seeing an acceleration in the market for RFPs?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Is your win rate higher or lower within that market? And then what level of ADAS are we seeing being quoted or requested the most from the OEM standpoint?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, so, level of activity \u2013 multiple questions. Level of activity, absolutely. And our win rate on that level of activity, I think we're close to 100% on the programs that we're bidding on. So level of activity has certainly gone up. What's driving that is really democratization of active safety and further penetration in the more mature markets. And then more rapid adoption in emerging markets like China. So we foresee \u2013 we talked about active safety growing over 50% this year and continuing at a 50% clip next year, so very, very strong growth.","What level? It tends to be anywhere between Level 1 and what I'd call Level 2 plus. There are some programs like zFAS that have Level 3 capabilities, but those tend to be rarer and tend to be with the luxury German OEs today.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood. And within your response, you mentioned other programs you're bidding on. Could you widen that out a little bit? How much larger is the market relative to what you're bidding on today? And what's bifurcating what you are going after and what you aren't going after?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, I'm not sure I can give you an exact, exact number. It's obviously a big market. It's growing roughly mid teens. Every OE is focused on it. And if you can imagine, at a 50% growth rate in revenues and roughly the same from a bookings standpoint, we're getting all the business that we can pursue at this point in time, when you look at allocation of resources.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood. And just the last one for me. Infotainment wins, you've had a lot over the past couple years that are starting to come in 15% to 20%. Is this all display audio product? Is it some embedded navigation? And what are you seeing at least from a bidding activity from the OEMs going forward?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, it's a mix. I'd say we're seeing more activity, or that area that we're more focused on, quite frankly, are areas where we have integrated cockpit controllers. So, where we start with the architecture. So, yeah. Joe was saying they tend to be mid to high end. It's about compute power, it's about graphics capability, and it's about scalability. So, we're really focusing our efforts on strategic relationships at the medium to high end sort of infotainment levels where content's going to grow and you're going to see more displays in the car.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And has there been any fundamental change in your win rates, what you're seeing there, following the acquisition by one of the larger competitors last year by Samsung?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Listen, we have a solid win rate. Bookings levels have been extremely strong this year. Opportunities are a little bit more back half loaded than what they've been in previous years. But we have some significant opportunities that we think we're in a great position to make that (01:06:15).","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","That $1.2 billion win in Q4 that we announced with a German luxury OE, that was a conquest win on a very high end system. So, we think our product offering and our ability to take sort of the centralized competing knowhow we have into that infotainment space is helping to drive that.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.

My name is Tracy, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Delphi's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jack Monti from Delphi's Investor Relations Group. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Jack Monti","Thanks, Tracy. And thanks so much, everyone, for joining Delphi's Third Quarter Earnings Call. Please see Slide 2 for the disclosure on forward-looking statements, which we'll be making on today's call and only reflect Delphi's current view of future financial performance, which may be materially different from our actual performance.","Joining today's call will be Rod O'Neal, Delphi's President and CEO; and Kevin Clark, our CFO. As seen on Slide 3, Rod O'Neal will begin the call with an overview of our third quarter, followed by Kevin Clark, who will review our financial performance in greater detail and provide an update to our guidance. After Rod's closing remarks, we'll open the line for Q&A.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Rod.","Rodney O'Neal","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'd first like to extend our deepest thoughts to those along the East Coast, who've been affected by Hurricane Sandy. And we do appreciate everyone's flexibility in the rescheduling of this call. So let me just quickly summarize our quarter, and then we'll get into the details.","We had a very solid quarter in a pretty challenging environment. We saw increased softening in Europe beginning in late August, and we were able to rapidly respond by adjusting our cost structure. We are on track to expand our EBITDA margins 40 to 50 basis points in 2012 on a reduction in reported revenues. And with this positive operating momentum, we are well positioned as we move into 2013. So let's turn to the quarter and if you could move to Slide 5, please.","So while our revenue growth was flat, adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 13.7%, and earnings per share increased just under 13%. And as I've mentioned in my opening remarks, we've taken and we will continue to take aggressive actions to increase the flexibility of our cost structure and better position us for margin expansion. We've initiated restructuring plans as we continue to rotate our footprint, optimize our cost structure and proactively address a much softer market. And at the same time, we continued to invest in strategic growth initiatives. Production is up and running at 2 new plants in China, and we've broke ground on another in this quarter. We've introduced 7 new technologies. And as you know, we also completed the acquisition of MVL, all of which has us well positioned for top and bottom line growth in 2013 and beyond.","Turning to Slide 6. Kevin and I just returned from China, where we held the grand opening for one of our electrical architecture line plants in Chongqing. Demand has been so strong at this plant that we expect to double our capacity next year. Throughout our visit, the customer responses could not have been more positive. We met with senior leadership from SIIC for China in SBW. I came away from those meetings more optimistic than ever about our growth prospects in China. We will continue to significantly outgrow the underlying market there. And we are on track to double the slide (sic) [size] of our China business over the next 4 years. We also held a groundbreaking ceremony for our new diesel facility in Yantai. The start of production is expected late next year. And recently, we also opened a wire facility in Chengdu. So these 3 plants: Chengdu, Chongqing and Yantai, are great examples of our success in China's rapidly growing market.","Let's move to Slide 7 and discuss some of our technology. We had a great portfolio of high-tech products, and we plan to continue to shape the market with our innovation. I know many of you have seen comments as recently as last week from the U.S. government regarding automated vehicles being the next evolutionary step of innovation in automotive transportation safety. Well, Delphi is already part of the Department of Transportation's pilot program, which is putting 2,800 vehicles on the road for a year of testing of vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. There are 8 leading OEMs that are participating, and it's the largest field test ever, and they're all using Delphi's advanced software and systems integration capability on these vehicles. The objective is to reduce collisions and improve traffic flow by having these vehicles literally talk to each other and surrounding infrastructure. So we're working with the government, and we're working with our customers, and this is a great example of Delphi's stand on the leading-edge of connectivity and active safety technologies.","Let's move to Slide 8. Another significant investment in 2012 has been the acquisition of MVL, as I mentioned. And as I told you back in May, when we originally announced the transaction, that I was really thrilled about this acquisition. MVL has been at the very top of our list of potential acquisitions for years, and it really does fit us like a glove. It significantly strengthens our high-growth, high-margin connector business and from a product portfolio of customer and Asia footprint perspective. So when you look at MVL's performance to date, it has actually performed better than we originally planned. And as we sit here today, we are even more confident in our ability to deliver those significant synergies that will expand margins and accelerate earnings growth. We are highly confident in our ability to fully achieve run rate synergies of $80 million by 2015. And we expect 40 to 50 basis points of margin enhancement and $0.24 of accretion in 2013, excluding the integration of onetime costs. Bottom line, it's a great acquisition, and we're happy to welcome MVL to Delphi.","Move to Slide 9. As many of you know, the Automotive News PACE Award is the pinnacle of technology achievements among automotive suppliers. The selection of 3 Delphi products and 1 manufacturing process as finalists for this prestigious award is validation once again that our technology investments are hitting the mark. Our nominations illustrate the type of innovative work being done by Delphi's technical experts all around world. The first product is Delphi's MyFi radio. It's a feature-rich embedded infotainment system that, when coupled with our active safety products, provides seamless integration of safety and connectivity. The second product, we call vehicle proximity alert, and this is designed so that pedestrians can better detect nearly silent hybrid and electric vehicles, and this is a feature increasingly required by the European governments. The third product is what we call F2e, and this is a diesel fuel injection pump system that will help OEs be the more strident emission standards that governments require for heavy-duty trucks in the future. And finally, in the manufacturing processing category, we were nominated for processing of our Gen 4 manifold air pressure sensor, which is a product that goes into engine management systems. This manufacturing process is highly efficient and significantly reduces the required amount of production floor space.","Let's move to Slide 10, which is our customer awards. We continue to receive accolades from our customers across the globe for exceeding their expectations on quality, on delivery and on launch. So when you look at the chart, you can see a sampling of a few of the awards that we've won in the last quarter. It is continued validation of our operational excellence, which is key to our top line expansion that I'm going to cover now.","Slide 11. Year-to-date on our bookings, we booked over $21 billion in new business, and we are on track to exceed last year's record of $24 billion. In Q3, we booked $5.5 billion, which includes an award from BMW for radar application, an award from Toyota in North America for vehicle electrical systems. And in China, we received an award from SGM that relates to our gas fuel systems there. We've generated almost $64 billion in new business since 2010. And as the right side of this slide shows, we continue to increase the geographical diversification of our business, with Asia bookings representing almost 35% of the total. These numbers validate the strong revenue growth that I've always talked about with you.","Let's move to Slide 12. We don't talk a lot about our enterprise operating system, but as we presented at our Investor Day in April, it truly is how we run the company. It's the reason we have performed so well, and it's the discipline that drives our operating performance and our industry-leading margins across the entire enterprise. I'm confident that the discipline of our operating systems will help us to continue to drive solid operating performance in the future.","Our restructuring actions will further optimize our cost structure and rotate our footprint to lower cost regions. And our continued focus on improving our operational excellence will keep us on track towards our longer-term EBITDA margin targets even in this slow growth environment. And we continue to perform at the highest levels to ensure that we delight our customers. And our focus, as always, will be on increasing shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin, who's going to cover our [indicernible].","Kevin P. Clark","Thanks, Rod. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering our third quarter results, then provide some additional background on the restructuring initiatives that Rod touched on, and then wrap up with an update on our fourth quarter and full year guidance.","So let me begin on Slide 14 with a snapshot of our third quarter results. As Rod mentioned, our overall financial performance this quarter was very solid considering the challenging operating environment. We delivered strong EBITDA margins and earnings per share growth, offsetting headwinds related to the slowdown in European light vehicle production, foreign exchange translation and the mark-to-market accounting requirement of our Long-Term Incentive Plan.","Our revenue totaled almost $3.7 billion. That's essentially flat versus the prior year when you adjust for FX, commodities and divestitures. We held 13.1% EBITDA margins, reflecting flexibility of our cost structure and continued strong operational execution. Net income totaled $269 million. Earnings per share increased by $0.05 or 6% to $0.84. And then lastly, we generated strong cash flow during the quarter of $254 million.","Now if you move to Slide 15, I'll review revenue in greater detail. Reported revenue declined 6.8%. Foreign exchange, commodity prices and divestitures created a 6.5-point headwind to revenue growth. Volume-related growth was $62 million or 1.6%, partially offsetting price down to $72 million or 1.8%. As I already mentioned, excluding foreign exchange, commodity prices and divestitures, revenue was basically flat.","If you look at it by region, in Asia, we had almost 12% growth, significantly over market. Within the Asia region, we had 13% growth in China, 7 points better than the underlying market. In North America, we had just under 3% growth, really reflecting our limited exposure to the Japanese transplants. In South America, we reported a revenue decline of 5%, primarily due to customer mix. And then lastly, in Europe, we saw a 6% revenue decline, which is about 2 points better than the market, to result a favorable customer mix, offset by a further reduction in customer schedules, both in the light vehicle and commercial vehicle segments that began, as Rod mentioned, in late August.","Slide 16 really underscores the flexibility of our cost structure and our ability to expand margins in a low-growth environment. EBITDA totaled $480 million. That's down $36 million from the prior year. This is reflective of the impact of price-downs, foreign exchange and the accounting for the Long-Term Incentive Program, partially offset by roughly 30% flow-through on revenue growth, strong manufacturing and material performance and the benefit of lower warranty expense. EBITDA margins remained unchanged at 13.1%. And although our European revenues were down 6%, as I mentioned, we maintained very solid double-digit margins in this region. They actually increased slightly on a year-over-year basis. I also think it's important to note that if you adjust for the variable accounting associated with the Long-Term Incentive Plan, consolidated EBITDA margins actually increased 60 basis points to 13.7%. That's on flat revenues, really reflecting the resiliency of our cost structure.","Slide 17 include our segment financial results. Electrical Architecture's revenue increased about 4%. That was driven by almost 14% growth in North America and over 9% growth in Asia. This was partially offset by a 2% decline in revenues in South America and an 8% decline in revenues in Europe. Segment EBITDA totaled $219 million, representing 13.6% EBITDA margin. That's down from the prior year, really reflecting the impact of increased launch costs, primarily in Mexico and in China, and continued investments in advanced engineering to support future growth initiatives.","Powertrain segment revenue was down 2%. This is reflective of 23% growth in Asia, offset by a 1% reduction in European revenues, affected by the late quarter slowdown in light duty and commercial vehicle schedules, as well as the lower mix of diesel fuel injection systems that Rod and I have touched on, a 14% reduction in revenues in North America and the 10% reduction in South American revenues. Both of these regions were affected by customer mix and continued softness in the automotive aftermarket channel. Despite the lower revenues, EBITDA increased to $175 million, and EBITDA margins expanded to 16.1%. These results reflect solid operating performance in the benefit of lower warranty expense, partially offset by increased advanced engineering expense and lower engineering rebuilds.","In our Electronics and Safety segment, revenue declined a little under 5%, primarily the result of a 4% increase in revenues in Asia and flat revenues in South America, offset by an 8% decline in European revenues and just under a 3% decline in revenues in North America. In this segment, the growth rate across all regions continued to be affected by the ongoing pruning of our lower margin business and our mechatronic and receiver product lines. Overall, the improved product mix resulted in an increase in EBITDA to $82 million, and expansion of our EBITDA margins to 12.7%.","Thermal segment revenues declined a little under 4%. That's primarily the result of the 10% growth in North America and the 8% growth in Asia. These results were offset by a 15% decline in European revenues and a 10% reduction in South American revenues. Adjusted EBITDA declined to $25 million, and EBITDA margins contracted to 6.7% due to lower volumes, as well as the impact of foreign exchange.","Turning to Slide 18. Earnings per share increased $0.05 or 6% to $0.84, reflecting strong operating performance, a lower tax rate, flow-through and volume growth and the benefit of share repurchases, partially offset by the impact of price-downs, FX and the accounting associated for the Long-Term Incentive Program. However, if you exclude the accounting for the Long-Term Incentive Plan, earnings per share actually increased $0.10 to $0.89. That's up 13%. And again, that's on reported revenues, which were down 6.8%, really reflecting our underscoring the leverage in the Delphi business model.","Moving to year-to-date cash flow in Slide 19. We continue to do a terrific job converting earnings into cash flow. Strong year-to-date EBITDA has more than offset the capital spending, cash interest and taxes. We've generated $642 million in cash before financing. That's up 20% over last year, which we've used to partially fund the purchase of MVL, as well as repurchased $312 million of stock during the last 2 quarters. It's worth noting that we've repurchased almost $0.5 billion of stock over the last 12 months.","Looking at our balance sheet on Slide 20. We ended the quarter with over $1.6 billion of cash on hand, just under $2.1 billion of debt and $445 million of net debt, representing very solid investment-grade credit metrics. The MVL transaction, which we closed on October 26, will slightly increase our pro forma credit statistics by less than half a turn. And lastly, the combination of our strong earnings growth and disciplined deployment of capital has generated an 8-point increase in return on net assets to 38%.","Moving to Slide 21. As Rod has already mentioned, we implemented a restructuring program targeted at further optimizing our cost structure and expanding our margin. The program includes several initiatives, but it's primarily focused on streamlining our European cost structure and includes continued rotation of our manufacturing and engineering footprint to lower-cost regions, further streamlining of administrative activities, as well as the integration of the MVL operations into our Electrical Architecture segment. Although we continue to perform very well relative to the market, we firmly believe there's always more that can be done to reduce our cost structure and increase our operating efficiency. The recent slowdown in Europe provides an opportunity to further address a portion of our cost structure, which is difficult to deal with in a higher-volume environment.","Total cost of the program will be approximately $250 million, with about $175 million to be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the balance will be booked throughout 2013. Approximately 75% of the total spend relates to our European operations, and about $80 million of the total is associated with the integration of the MVL operations into our Electrical Architecture segment. Approximately $240 million of the total restructuring charge will be cash, with about $35 million to $40 million to be spent in 2012, roughly $140 million to $150 million in 2013 and the balance in 2014. We expect the restructuring program to generate roughly $70 million to $80 million in total benefits in 2013, which includes about $40 million to $50 million of synergies related to the MVL acquisition.","Slide 22 details some of the assumptions underlying our updated guidance. We've provided the current production forecast from IHS for your reference only. We've highlighted that the deterioration in their Q4 forecast in Europe. It is very important to note that our guidance is based on current customer production schedules, which includes lower production levels in Europe than are reflected in this latest IHS forecast. We're expecting fourth quarter global production of 20.6 million units. That's down 1.5% versus the prior year. And that assumption includes production of 4.4 million units in Europe, just down roughly 15% from the same period last year.","Turning to Slide 23 to discuss our fourth quarter guidance. Our current outlook looks like a repeat of Q3, which reflects the lower European production schedule I just highlighted and a slightly lower mix of diesel fuel injection systems to the softer sales in the commercial vehicle and light duty markets, partially offset by a stronger euro. We expect revenues of $3.725 billion to $3.825 billion, including $125 million of revenue from MVL, which is net of roughly $15 million of intercompany sales.","Our EBITDA and earnings per share guidance excludes the fourth quarter restructuring charge of roughly $175 million, as well as $11 million of MVL transaction-related expenses. We expect EBITDA to be in the range of $460 million to $500 million, reflecting a less favorable flow-through effect on lower revenue and product mix, slightly offset by the translational effect of a stronger euro and approximately $22 million of EBITDA from MVL.","Earnings per share will be in the range of $0.80 to $0.90, assuming the 318 million shares outstanding and the 10% tax rate. Including the restructuring and MVL transaction-related expenses, earnings per share will be $0.30 to $0.40.","Turning to Slide 24 to review our updated full year guidance. Based on the year-to-date actual results in fourth quarter outlook, we now expect full year revenues of $15.475 billion to $15.575 billion, which again includes approximately $125 million of MVL revenues, net of intercompany sales. Excluding a fourth quarter restructuring charge and MVL transaction-related expenses, EBITDA will be in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.14 billion. And we've tightened our earnings per share guidance to the lower end of our previous guidance range. Our current outlook is $3.68 to $3.78 per share. Our earnings per share guidance assumes 324 million shares outstanding and a 17% full year effective tax rate. Including restructuring and MVL-related transaction costs, earnings per share will be in the range of $3.18 to $3.28.","We're now guiding to free cash flow of approximately $800 million, primarily reflecting lower EBITDA, cash restructuring expense and transaction-related fees and expenses associated with MVL.","And with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Rod.","Rodney O'Neal","Thanks, Kevin. And before we move into Q&A, I just want to remind everyone that Delphi had a very strong Q3 despite the macroeconomic headwinds. And as always, we remain focused on outstanding execution and then balancing disciplined investment in growth initiatives with actions to further reduce our cost structure. Our strong cash flow will continue to be deployed to enhance shareholder value, as demonstrated by our MVL acquisition and the $312 million of stock we repurchased over the last 2 quarters.","Now looking forward, even on a low-growth environment, we are well positioned for solid organic margin expansion and earnings per share growth. We remain committed to creating shareholder value and achieving our long-term objectives for the business, which we believe will further strengthen our position as the premier global automotive supplier. So, operator, we'll now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just want to go to I think this part of your culture for what I see as a soft spot here in the quarter, which we overall agree was good, Thermal. Could you talk a little bit more? Last quarter, you flagged Brazil behind the soft margins. But in general, it seems to be a more competitive, less margin-risked business than Powertrain and Electronics. We saw it hollow this morning around 8% below where your other segments are. So can you talk maybe just both short term and then mid-term about Thermal and what kind of actions you've got the division on to bring margins up back into the low teens, or if we should not be thinking that?","Rodney O'Neal","No, I think you should be thinking that because that's exactly what we're thinking, double-digit margins is our goal. Look, we've been working very hard on it. And James is doing an outstanding job of offsetting some very dramatic volume declines in Europe and in South America. And so the value prop of Thermal has been and will continue to be its -- the margins, I agree, are lower than some of the other businesses in Delphi. But then, an outstanding return on invested capital doesn't require a lot of our CapEx to invest in our engineering, and not a lot of time and resources from the business perspective. So it's a contributor to the company, has been and will be going forward. I think here -- the key here is just a shift that we saw in August and September from the volumes, particularly in Europe. So it is what it is in terms of the volume downturn. And the industry characteristics are slightly different than some of our other businesses, but it creates outstanding value.","Kevin P. Clark","Can I interject?","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Some of these restructuring targeted at this unit?","Kevin P. Clark","Brian I was going to -- it's Kevin Clark. I was going to touch on it. I wouldn't say -- through the first 2 months of the last quarter, we're in a solid trajectory. I think as we communicated to you on our last call, our target was 10%-plus EBITDA margins in that segment beginning in this quarter. And we're on a trajectory to achieve that level. And then we saw volume fall off late in the quarter in Europe. And secondly, yes, a part of the overall restructuring plan includes their activities, both in -- well, actually in North America, Europe, as well as South America. So we're focused on further reducing the cost structure, adjusting the cost structure in light of lower volume or particularly lower volume outlook.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a broader question. During the quarter, you announced the share buyback program upsizing. Could you maybe share some of your and the board's thinking around cash share buyback strategy, mid-term? And I guess a question we get from investors is, is this kind of a one-time somewhat grudging, we've got some excess cash, take it back, or are you thinking about a kind of continual buyback program in the auto sector? You see AutoNation and AutoZone historically doing that, that we can kind of think about modeling in to continually reduce the share count?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, listen, we've talked about this previously. We look at the Delphi business model and our cost structure and our ability to expand margins and, importantly, generate significant cash flow. And we think one of our strong strategic advantages is the ability to generate that cash flow, deploy it in ways to generate shareholder value, whether they'd be strategic acquisitions like MVL that are accretive to margins or -- and EPS, as well as return cash to shareholders. And on a go-forward basis, we think one of the staples that we have and we'll consistently use to drive shareholder value is to repurchase stock near term and then a little bit, medium to longer term, probably a balance of some amount of the dividend, as well as share repurchase.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was hoping you can maybe talk about your outlook for organic growth. Up until now, you've had some headwinds relative to the overall industry production. The GM year-over-year production changes were less, yet the South America issue. Could you just talk about how you expect that to look going forward, maybe the comparison start to change here with the Japanese on a year-over-year basis are not driving as much the year-over-year change, and maybe start with that, the fourth quarter you're looking for a 1.5% decline in production.","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, to make sure I understand the question, Rod, your question is with respect to our growth rate relative to the Delphi markets we serve?","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Correct. Your role to them.","Kevin P. Clark","I would say in the fourth quarter, given our outlook for Europe and given our customer mix, we would expect to grow roughly at market on a global basis. And we would expect that to improve, growth rate over market as we head into 2013.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So basically, the declines from some of the Germans now are looking in Europe like the overall market. Is that how I can read your statement?","Kevin P. Clark","I wouldn't say they look like the overall market. But in the past, where they were growing on a year-over-year basis in a shrinking market, we have a slightly different dynamic today and are expecting that dynamic to continue in the fourth quarter.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And your comments on the margin expansion that you're anticipating for next year, is that basically a function of MVL, the long-term comp, and the restructuring? Or is there anything else that you see mix-wise or productivity-wise that could drive your margins next year?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, depending on the outlook for volume growth and then standard operational performance, those are the 2 other levers. And we'll give guidance as we release our outlook for revenue growth in -- for 2013 when we announce our fourth quarter earnings.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, I was hoping you might be able to explain the FX impact on your business. It looks like I think it's a bit higher than it's been running. In terms of conversion, you'd a $212 million impact on sales, and it looks like a $45 million impact on EBITDA. What actually is happening there, and how should we be thinking about how FX affects your earnings going forward?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, I think as you look at it longer term, Rod, in reality, the FX effect, whether it be a plus or a minus, should flow through slightly less than what our EBITDA margins are. That's for sure the way we look at it. This quarter, I would say we had an incremental amount of transaction-related expense that affected our number.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You see that as a onetime kind of thing, not...","Kevin P. Clark","I see it as a onetime kind of thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe we can just pick up there on the walk to 2013, if you could just quantify a little bit and repeat some of the numbers that you said. What's the magnitude of the step-down that you anticipate in stock comp, if you could remind us of that? And then, Rod, if you could repeat, or Kevin, the contribution you're expecting from MVL. And then the restructuring, I think, you said was $80 million to $90 million. Just trying to think about all of the built-in tailwinds that you have in '13 that are going to help offset the industry headwinds?","Kevin P. Clark","I think let's go through, and we'll tick off one by one. So the restructuring benefit associated with this plan would be roughly $70 million to $80 million, I believe is what I said. $40 million to $50 million of that related to the MVL transaction. Yes, roughly $80 million to $100 million -- $80 million to $90 million of incentive comp reduction. And then you have the, I guess, 10-month contribution versus 12-month contribution of the MVL transaction at roughly a 16% EBITDA margin on a business that has, on a consolidated basis, roughly $1 billion of consolidated revenues. All right. And then what you would overlay on that would be assumptions as it relates to price, performance, volume, product mix.","Rodney O'Neal","Yes. And, Chris, we -- when we come back on the next quarter call, we'll be able to have greater clarity in terms of our assumptions for 2013. But the tailwinds are -- well, that's basically just math, but we really haven't locked in yet what we think the '13 volumes are going to be, so we need a little bit more clarity on that.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","One more item on '13, while you're at it. What is the tax rate that you expect for '13? Is that going to be migrating higher?","Kevin P. Clark","We would expect a 17%, about where we are today, about 17% effective tax rate.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last item. You mentioned a few times in your walk through the quarter, it sounded like some help from lower warranty expense. Can you add all that up and quantify what kind of  a help that was and if that's something that you anticipate continuing to be a tailwind in the fourth quarter and into next year?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, I would -- I wouldn't expect it to be a tailwind on a go-forward basis. I'd say it's roughly $20 million in the quarter primarily -- $20 million to $25 million, primarily in the Powertrain side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just want to -- was going to talk in the cash flow guidance, looks like it came down maybe $225 million pre-CapEx. Kevin, I think you mentioned a couple items, including cash restructuring. I was hoping you can give us a more detailed walk between those 2 items?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, here's how I would look at the cash flow guide -- or change in the cash flow guidance. Roughly -- based on our current guidance for the fourth quarter, roughly $100 million left in EBITDA, $35 million of restructuring-related spend, $10 million of fees associated with the MVL transaction. And then our presumption now going forward is that we're going to pay the VCP -- make the VCP payment on 12\/31 of this year, which is a headwind of about $200 million.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And then just with the macro conditions being what they are, are you seeing any change in launch schedules. Seems like your bookings are still very strong. Is there any change or shift in timing of actual launch that it may affect next year, particularly relative to the backlog you disclosed lasts for -- up to 2013? And are you seeing any change in commercial, settlement agreements or other type of activity with the OEMs?","Rodney O'Neal","Not really. I think the biggest change has been in the area of what I would call the electrification of the vehicle, which isn't really like the volume issues. But definitely, you're seeing delays or, in some cases, even cancellation on EV's and, in some cases, even on the hybrids. But in general, the launch cadence has been pretty consistent across the globe and not a lot of delays there. Some customers have had some issues with just launch. I wouldn't go to the specifics, but they had a little slowing in terms of making sure that the vehicles launched were in great quality. But overall, not a lot of movement in that area. And in terms of pricing, it's always the same, as you better have something that matters or you're going to be under siege. We have something that matters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a couple housekeeping items here to start. Kevin, you talked about $70 million to $80 million of savings in 2013. But with the size of that, there's probably some carryover savings in '14. Can you quantify that?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, the restructuring plan would generate $70 million to $80 million in 2013. We'd expect 2014 for those numbers to effectively be a little bit more than twice that amount, so $150 million to $180 million of EBITDA.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And that's a cumulative number, not incremental?","Kevin P. Clark","That is a cumulative number, yes.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's great. And then on the Powertrain warranty, I don't think you've quantified what the impact of that was on the comps. In Powertrain, you said, it was mostly due to the warranty -- absence of the warranty.","Kevin P. Clark","I think it's roughly $20 million to $25 million.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","$20 million to $ 25 million? Okay. That's great. And then the last little number item here. If we look at the long-term incentive comp, where is that running year-to-date, and what do you think the Q4 impact is?","Kevin P. Clark","The Q4 impact from a run rate standpoint will be roughly the same as what we had here in Q3. From a full year standpoint, it's about $100 million of expense.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then on the European restructuring, can you give us some sense of the buckets across the businesses?","Kevin P. Clark","Just given where we are in the process, we'd rather not. And it's a mix of, again, manufacturing and engineering footprint, as well as administrative activities.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Maybe if we look at this way, as you rotate that manufacturing and engineering footprint, where are you today in terms of high-class Europe locations versus low-cost and where you want that to end up at the end of this restructuring?","Rodney O'Neal","I'd say in general, in Europe, we probably -- we've got about 30% of our workforce is temporary. It's falling a little bit because of the volume shifts we've taken as probably in the mid-20s now in terms of the contract. That mix was more or less 75% to 80% low-cost footprint in Europe. The remaining was primarily in the higher-capital ends of our business. And then what we're doing now is just taking advantage of some of the noise that's in the environment and moving some of that footprint eastward. So ultimately, the goal is to get Europe as in line as the rest of the world, but there's a time and there's a cost for everything. And so we've got our margins in Europe, a double digit, with some very smart execution of rotation. And this is just another one of those examples where we're taking advantage of the situation and moving forward. So it's around 80% today, 75% to 80%.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly here, as we look at China with the new business awards that you're getting there, is there a way that you could characterize how much of that is the manufacturers in China adopting your technology as opposed to market share gains versus folks who are already there?","Rodney O'Neal","Well, if you look at the characteristics of the Chinese market, it's very Western, like from a consumer preference standpoint. They really like the heavily contented vehicles. And so today, we have about 20 of our 33 product lines in China. And so when you look at what the recent additions of the portfolio has been, status-symbol electronics, more sophisticated infotainment, safety aspects, emission aspects. That's why we're pretty confident we're going to continue to outgrow the underlying markets there because of the market shifting in our direction from a portfolio perspective. And then also, we're pretty diversified, where around 60% of our business is multinational, and around 40% is with the winning locals. So we feel the market is rotating perfectly into Delphi's Safe, Green and Connected sweet spot.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Matt Stover with Guggenheim.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","You may have addressed this in your comments, I apologize, I was just interrupted. But could you put some meat on the bones of the margin performance on a year-over-year basis in the Powertrain business and in the E\/EA sector? And I have a follow-up question.","Kevin P. Clark","To make sure I understand your question, you're looking for more color on the margin performance year-over-year in E\/EA and Powertrain?","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. Could you provide some details? You saw nice margin improvements in Powertrain and deterioration in E\/EA.","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. Deterioration in E\/EA, you're right, on a year-to-year basis, we saw a reduction in margins from 14.1% last year to, if you adjust out the variable accounting for the VCP, 13.6% this year, so a 50-basis-point decline. So we saw strong flow-through on volume growth of about 30%. However, from a manufacturing performance standpoint, we didn't see strong manufacturing performance primarily related to the fact as Rod mentioned, the new facilities that we're launching in China and in Mexico. Both of those affected the manufacturing productivity, as well as we made a conscious decision and we have been all year quite frankly to invest incremental dollars in advanced engineering for new product development. As it relates to Powertrain, you see margins increasing 200 basis points, so 14.1% to 16.1%. And what's driving growth there, you basically have revenues that are flat. So you have a slight degradation in margin. That's slightly lower revenues. Manufacturing performance was very strong. So to offset some of that, we continue to invest in -- again, in that area, in advanced engineering, both on the gas side of the business, gas fuel injection systems, as well as diesel fuel injection systems. And then we got the benefit of the $20 million, $25 million of lower warranty expense.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the last question is, so you've taken restructuring actions. The market outlook for Europe remains fairly uncertain, and it's a possibility that will muddle along, get weaker here for a while. Should we expect that this is sort of the big bulk of action that gets taken in Europe, or would we anticipate something similar to these elevated charges in 2013?","Rodney O'Neal","Kevin, you want to go [indiscernible].","Kevin P. Clark","[indiscernible] just a math to make sure. So of the $250 million of restructuring charges, as I told you, some of that is -- $175 million can be booked this year, with the balance booked next year, so you'll see a proportion of this program. I would say based on what we see today in terms of volume in our underlying assumptions, we would not expect there to be incremental restructuring plans. But it's something that we always watch, and we're always focused on reducing and optimizing our cost structure. And if the opportunity presented itself and the returns made sense, that's something we would do.","Rodney O'Neal","This is an experienced management team. When we constructed this new company, one of the things that we made sure of when we put it together is that it was flexible and it was nimble because we got a great strategy that produces a lot of opportunity, and the team executes flawlessly, and we seize that opportunity. We know where we are, we know where we want to go, we know how we're going to get there. But even as good as we are and what I just described, the world has a way of putting bumps in the road, always has, always will. And the way we look at it, the way my philosophy is, we wake up in the morning, we look at what the world has put in front of us, and we just deal with it. And so right now, I don't expect us to be doing anything significant in Europe based on assumptions we have. But if the environment changes, we'll react to it because we've got a company that we think we can continue to produce superior results even when the volume isn't there, and then when the volume is there, where we can leverage it up. And so philosophically, we'll just deal with whatever is in front of us. And so I think when we come back and -- at the end of Q4 and do the call, we'll be able to outline exactly here is what we think the world is going to handle, deal to us in terms of the hand, and then we would just -- we'd tell you quite clearly what we're going to do to deal with it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's actually John Murphy. Just one of the themes that seems to be coming across here -- a lot of detailed questions have been asked here, but one of the themes that's coming across is there's a little bit of margin compression hear in the short term as you're investing. I'm just more curious less so about the margin and more just on return targets because one of the great parts of your story is that you have this -- your return on invested capital is in, depending on how you're calculating in the mid- to high-20s, really strong. It's really I think what attracts people to the Delphi story. I'm just trying to understand, as you're putting these incremental dollars into the ground and the investment in growth in the future, if you think you'd be able to maintain those, and how we should think about that going forward.","Kevin P. Clark","Well, John, I think our point is we look at it, and I think we're highly confident that over the medium and long term, we'll be able to increase them. Volume affects us. Volume swings on a quarter-to-quarter basis may affect us. But every decision we make is made with the overlay and the intention that we're going to increase cash flow efficiency and we're going to drive higher returns. So that's the way we look at, whether it's an M&A opportunity, whether it's an organic investment in a specific customer program or development of the new products or the launch of a new facility.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's incredibly helpful. And just one other question I -- and I apologize, I may have missed this part of the call. As we think about the movement in Europe to maybe more LCC sourcing there, and where you are around the rest of the world, and it's currency just swinging around a little bit more than it has in -- historically, more recently. Is there any more risk to ForEx going forward that would be more economic and less just translational or a lot of your contracts priced in the same certain currency that they're being produced?","Kevin P. Clark","I wouldn't say that our risk profile, in light of the current macro environment, foreign exchange rate hasn't -- it's no different than what it was early this year or last year. There's no change.","Rodney O'Neal","Yes, I think it's the beauty of the model, where our pricing and our cost tend to be in the same currencies, so it would minimize the -- a massive amount of risk in that area.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Richard Hilgert with Morningstar.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions here. We saw just recently one of the Japanese luxury guys announced that they were going to be doing drive-by-wire launching within the next 12 months. We've been hearing about drive-by-wire and break-by-wire for, geez, the last 15 years or so. Are we now going to start seeing -- actually seeing these products showing up in vehicles? Or is that particular manufacturer just kind of one that's kind of a prime mover, and everybody's going to take a wait-and-see approach and see what happens with lawsuits or anything that might come from having the technology?","Rodney O'Neal","Well, I'm not sure I'm totally tracking, but drive-by-wire and break-by-wire are pretty prevalent across the entire industry in the more upscale cars. Are you talking about automated vehicles or just the technology?","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","No, this is not like a hybrid, where you've got electrics driving a mechanical connection. This is purely electrical with a mechanical backup that actuates in the event that 3 redundant systems actually fail. So this is purely and completely electrical, and this is the first time that it's in mass-produced -- it's the first time as being in a mass-produced vehicle so...","Rodney O'Neal","Here's the way I look at it. It's a cost-versus-benefit issue. And I think you just described a little bit of the cost when you got a system, and then you got 3 backups. So it's going to go on a very special kind of car, one high end. It's not a technology at this stage that will be democratized across the entire vehicle fleet. So it's not that revolutionary. It can be done. It's not that -- it's always -- the issue is the benefit, and does the consumer -- is the consumer willing to pay for it. And so nothing new there, all right?","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes. Okay, good. With a lot of your business being in the Asian region and given the dynamics there of the Japanese and the Chinese market, is there any impact there for you guys?","Rodney O'Neal","Well, we're not -- we don't have a lot of -- in China, we don't have a lot of Japanese business, so we're not negatively impacted there. And to be honest, it's still early. We haven't seen a dramatic shift, where I would call the consumer has fled the Japanese players and moved over to either the multinational or to local, haven't seen that shift. But there's a lot of prediction that it will occur. I think it remains to be seen how permanent this is versus just a temporary emotional aspect. But right now, we don't see a big move in consumer preferences yet in terms of impacting sales of vehicles, other than like the Japanese aren't selling. But there hasn't been a lot of rotation yet on the -- to the Chinese locals or multinational.","Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last. We've talked a little bit about Europe on the call here. Getting inventory levels or read-on inventory over there is a really difficult thing to do, to say the least. But I was curious, if you've gotten a sense from your customers as to whether or not this is the amount that we're seeing production schedules dropping for the fourth quarter and the likelihood that there's still going to be pretty low, obviously, in the first quarter. Have we corrected or will we correct the inventory given these new production schedules? Or is there a sense that inventories are still pretty high and this is going to be an extended production low that we're seeing?","Rodney O'Neal","I don't know. I mean, we don't have a really good look into 2013 yet, so we will provide clarity to that in our next call. I guess, I look at it from a positive standpoint that the behavior of the OEs in this environment is one where they're matching their production to demand. And historically if you look back in the past, that wasn't always there. So I'm extremely encouraged with the actions. And while we never want to see volumes taken down, this is really -- it's important to take these kind of actions just to keep the industry in line, such that we can stay healthy through this period. So first of all, I'm encouraged and applaud the actions of the OEs. And so all of us are making the adjustments. The premise of this, we'll have to come back to you, but right now, we don't see anything that says that things are going to get dramatically worse. The question is how is it flat or slightly up. But we got to come back to you with clarity.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Rodney O'Neal","Hey, I appreciate all of you joining. Thanks a lot.

My name is Kayla, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to Delphi Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Elena Rosman, Delphi's Vice President of Investor Relations. Elena, you may begin your conference.","Elena Dom Rosman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning, Kayla. And thank you for joining Delphi's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. To follow along with today's presentation, our slides can be found at delphi.com under the Investors section of the website.","Consistent with prior calls, today's review of our actual and forecasted financials excludes restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations of Delphi. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the back of the presentation and the press release. Please see slide 2 for a disclosure on forward-looking statements, which do reflect Delphi's current view of the future financial performance, which may be materially different from our actual performance.","Joining us today will be Kevin Clark, Delphi's President and CEO; and Joe Massaro, CFO and Senior Vice President. As seen on slide 3, Kevin will provide an operations update as well as an overview of the quarter. And then Joe will cover the financial results and the 2016 outlook in more detail.","With that I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before Joe gets into our financial results, I'd like to provide some color on what was a great quarter for Delphi. So let's begin with the highlights on slide 5.","In summary we had another very solid quarter, meeting our commitments in delivering strong revenue and earnings growth. Adjusted revenue growth was 6%, driven by market share and content gains across the portfolio. Operating income increased to $509 million, margins expanded 20 basis points to 12.6%, and earnings per share increased 12% to $1.36. And lastly, we returned approximately $450 million of cash to shareholders.","We remain very confident in our 2016 guidance as originally communicated back in January. There's nothing we see today that changes our view of the underlying macro environment, with some things stronger, offsetting shortfalls elsewhere. I'll touch on the macros in greater detail on the next slide.","The ramp-up of new program launches will continue to drive accelerated revenue growth. And a strong focus on leveraging our robust business model will enable us to flex our cost structure to meet the challenges of virtually any environment.","In addition, we made a number of important announcements during our recent Investor Update meeting in London. We unveiled a 48-volt vehicle solution, which improves engine performance while lowering CO2 emissions by more than 10%. I'll cover this in more detail later.","We also announced the IRS Section 7874 issue is behind us. And that we've prevailed in our appeal, contending that Delphi should be treated as a U.K. tax entity under the U.S. tax code.","And we announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. Coupled with the recent dividend increase, this underscores confidence in our medium- and long-term outlook, which is driven by the safe, green, and connected megatrends that are creating new revenue opportunities for Delphi. Continued material manufacturing performance which is funding incremental growth investments and driving margin expansion, which will translate into cash flow generation, providing additional levers to drive shareholder value.","During the quarter we also acquired PureDepth, Inc., the leading provider of multi-layer 3D display technology. Our collaboration with PureDepth was on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in a concept Mustang, which has driven significant customer interest.","Slide 6 is an update on our view of the macro environment, which as I just mentioned, continues to remain balanced relative to the assumptions underlying our 2016 guidance. I'll hit a few of the highlights.","Starting with positives on the left. Regulatory trends and consumer demands continue to influence fuel economy, emissions, and vehicle safety standards, driving content per vehicle growth. And we continue to expect steady growth in global vehicle production, driven by continued growth in China, North America, and Western Europe.","Moving to the middle of the chart. Consistent with our initial planning assumptions we expect commodities and pricing to remain relatively neutral for the balance of the year. While we're currently seeing a slightly stronger euro, this is being more than offset by the weakened Chinese RMB, with China being a meaningful part of our business.","Moving to the challenges on the right. We've seen further declines in vehicle production in both South America and Eastern Europe and increased weakness in the global commercial vehicle market, now expected to be down low-single digits driven by double-digit declines in the North American off-highway market.","Lastly, we're working closely with our suppliers and OEM customers to mitigate any near-term supply disruptions due to the recent earthquakes in Japan, which will affect the second quarter but will be made up during the balance of the year. Joe will provide more context on this a little bit later.","Given the various puts and takes, our overall outlook remains in line with our prior guidance.","More on China on slide 7. I just returned from the Beijing Auto Show, where I met with several of our top customers. We heard a relatively consistent view of the China market. Both global and local OEMs remain very confident China will continue to drive increased global vehicle production. Estimating 2016 growth in the 4% to 6 % range, resulting from continued strong demand for SUVs and crossovers.","There's also increasing dialogue regarding new energy vehicles and electrification in this market, which, given our product portfolio, provides further revenue opportunities. Delphi remains well positioned in this market and expects to grow 10 points to 12 points above vehicle production in 2016, benefiting from market share gains and the trend towards higher content vehicles.","Growth in the China market is reflected in our new business bookings on slide 8, which totaled approximately $7 billion during the first quarter. We had a number of important customer bookings, as well as several conquest wins, including a major electrical architectural win with FCA on the Ram truck in North America, power train wins with Changan in China and Ford in North America, and key infotainment wins with Volkswagen in North America as well as with SGM in China.","The right side of the chart reflects the balanced geographic mix of our bookings, which will drive strong revenue growth over the next few years. The increased geographic and customer diversity ensures that we're not dependent on any one region, segment, or customer for growth.","Now given our portfolio of safe, green, and connected technology solutions and our track record of flawless execution, we're increasingly becoming a strategic partner of choice for a number of our customers, which is reflected in our record bookings over the last few years.","Turning to slide 9. These are just a few examples of launch programs driving revenue growth this past quarter. Our Electrical Architecture segment is benefiting from increased content on the BMW X5, an onboard charger for plug-in hybrid power trains. Also with BMW our Power Train division launched several components on the new Active Tourer. And the Electronics and Safety division is launching multiple programs, including short range radar in the Kia Cadenza and the infotainment content on the Lincoln MKX, Buick Excelle, and Dodge Ram truck.","Moving to slide 10. As we highlighted at our Investor Day and was reinforced in Beijing last week, customer interest in electrification is gaining momentum. Our customers increasingly see the need for electrification of the power train to close the regulatory gaps on CO2 emissions and fuel economy. And 48-volt hybrids are an affordable, no compromise solution. An optimized electrical architecture system is necessary for the electrification of today's vehicles, which is the very foundation for our volt \u2013 48-volt solution. Customer response has been strong for our total system solution, which represents approximately four times the content opportunity, compared to a traditional internal combustion engine for Delphi.","Now in addition to the two global customer programs we've already been awarded, we've received strong interest from several auto makers to explore collaborating on this very interesting technology.","Turning to slide 11. Delphi continues to be recognized for its technology leadership by both customers and industry experts. Delphi is proud to have received the first ever General Motors innovation award for our V2X module, which will be introduced on the all new Cadillac CT6. We are the first to market with this breakthrough technology.","We also won our 18th Automotive News PACE award, after once again leading the industry with three nominations. The Dual Role Hub is a custom USB application that enables Apple CarPlay, allowing the radio in an iPhone to be recognized simultaneously as a host device. It's the only solution on the market with this versatile functionality.","Leading in innovation is a foundation of our strategy for growth, and these industry awards are strong validation that we're solving our customers' most challenging problems with industry-leading technologies.","Moving to slide 12. Before I hand things over to Joe, I want to underscore our commitment to driving consistent, sustainable, and, importantly, profitable growth. Since our IPO we've completed several transactions that enhanced our technology portfolio and better positioned us for the future. Our advanced technologies are aligned to the megatrends of safe, green, and connected, positioning us for accelerated revenue growth.","Our lean cost structure and global footprint allows us to further leverage both our scale and regional capabilities to drive revenue growth and margin expansion. And lastly, we will continue to execute a very balanced and very disciplined capital allocation strategy to drive increased shareholder returns. Our track record conveys our execution capabilities. And we are very confident we will deliver continued out-performance for years to come.","I now want to turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Great. Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering our first quarter performance and then discuss our second quarter and full year 2016 guidance.","Let's start on slide 14 with a snapshot of our first quarter financial performance. As Kevin mentioned, we were pleased with our results, which reflected both strong revenue and earnings growth. Revenue was up 7%, or 6% adjusted for currency, commodity, acquisitions, and divestitures. Our operating margins expanded 20 basis points. Earnings per share grew 12%, largely the result of increased net income. And in the quarter we purchased 5.6 million shares totaling $370 million. The adjusted tax rate was 18% for the quarter.","Slide 15 provides greater detail of revenue for the quarter. Starting on the left you can see we had strong sales growth, including the impact of M&A, primarily HellermannTyton, which had organic growth of 13% in the first quarter. Foreign exchange and commodities were a slightly bigger headwind, primarily driven by dollar strengthening against the Chinese RMB and the price of copper.","Moving to the right. North America, Europe, and Asia saw strong growth on both a reported as well as an adjusted basis. And as you can see, the South American market remains very weak. And we are not planning on a near-term recovery. Accordingly, we have taken significant steps in the past year to reduce our South American footprint and cost structure, including exiting our business in Argentina and reducing the number of Brazilian manufacturing facilities from nine to four. And while we remain able to serve our global customers in South America, we have significantly reduced the impact of the market downturn on Delphi.","Turning to operating income. Slide 16 walks the year-over-year change for the first quarter. Our operating results were consistent with our expectations. Strong flow through from volume growth contributed to margin expansion in the quarter, helping to offset the impact of launch and growth related activities on our net performance.","The impact of the China volume ramp and the added cost to support new program launches in E&S and E\/EA totaled approximately $35 million in the quarter. The China inefficiencies discussed previously represented approximately $5 million in Q1 and will not have an impact going forward. The remaining launch costs will further moderate over the course of the year and continue to be factored into our full year 2016 guidance.","Slide 17 takes us through the performance by segment. Electrical Architecture had adjusted growth of 5%, and HellermannTyton contributed approximately $200 million of revenue in the quarter. E\/EA margins expanded 70 basis points year over year.","Powertrain also delivered 5% organic growth, driven by gas systems, partially offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes. And Powertrain continues to deliver strong margins, despite nearly 40 basis points of FX headwinds, primarily driven by the Chinese RMB.","Electronics and Safety organic growth accelerated to 13% on new program launches, particularly in active safety and infotainment programs in Europe and China, partially offset by lower mechatronics sales, which represented a 3% negative impact on E&S growth in the quarter.","Active safety and infotainment continued to see strong growth of approximately 70% and 10% respectively. Our E&S margins of 10.3% were as expected and reflect the launch-related activities I just discussed.","As it relates to the remainder of 2016, we expect continued strong growth from new launches and for margins to expand over the course of the year, as we ramp production volumes and improve performance.","Turning now to slide 18. We saw total EPS growth of $0.15 or 12% for the quarter, including $0.11 from increased earnings. Share repurchases contributed $0.07, more than offsetting the impact of a higher tax rate. As you know, the tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter. However, there is no change to our 17% full year estimate.","Now turning to the outlook on page 19. As Kevin mentioned, given the puts and takes, there are no changes to the 2016 guidance. Revenue is driven by accelerating organic growth throughout the year and the full year effect of the HellermannTyton acquisition. We expect to expand margins by roughly 50 basis points. And 2016 EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.80 to $6.10, reflecting year-over-year growth of 14%.","Second quarter revenue is forecasted in the range of $4.125 billion to $4.225 billion. This includes the impact of the supply disruptions from the Japanese earthquakes, estimated to be $75 million of revenue and $20 million of operating income at the midpoint of our guidance. While we continue to monitor and assess the potential impact, conversations with our customers indicate that any near-term production disruptions will be made up over the balance of the year.","We expect second quarter EPS in the range of $1.50 to $1.60, up 16% at the midpoint, which includes the impact from the earthquake supply disruptions.","Our strong balance sheet and capital allocation strategy, outlined on slide 20, remains an important lever to enhance shareholder value. On the left we expect cash flow from operations to grow approximately $2 billion, up almost 20% from 2015. And the deployment priorities on the right are consistent with our strategy, maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade rating. We are investing in our business through increased capital expenditures supporting new program launches, information systems that increase efficiency and productivity, and ongoing footprint rotation to best cost countries.","We are committed to paying a competitive dividend. And to the extent we have excess cash, we have a track record of returning it to shareholders via share repurchases, as evidenced by the $370 million of repurchases we did in the first quarter. As we sit here today, we do not expect repurchases to continue at the first quarter pace. However, we intend to be opportunistic, while remaining committed to executing a balanced and disciplined capital allocation framework.","Now before I hand things back to Kevin, turning to slide 21, we are focused on executing value-enhancing portfolio modifications. As such, in the quarter we completed the final step in the divestiture of the Thermal business with the sale of our stake in the Chinese joint venture. And we have acquired PureDepth, the leading provider of patented 3D multi-layer display technology. You can expect us to continue to pursue investments that enhance our existing technology portfolio, strengthen our competitive position, and drive increased value for our shareholders.","I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some closing remarks before we open up the call to questions.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Joe. Now summarizing on slide 21 (sic) [slide 22], we delivered another strong quarter, executing on the relevant advanced technologies that enable us to outgrow the markets we serve. We believe we're well positioned to deliver on our commitments in 2016: high-single digit organic growth, roughly 50 basis points of margin expansion, solid mid-teens EPS growth, and $1.2 billion of free cash flow.","We continue to optimize our cost structure, increase the flexibility of our work force, and execute flawlessly. We're investing in profitable growth where we see opportunities. We remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, investing in both organic and inorganic growth, and returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Through all this we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver on our commitments, even against the backdrop of a dynamic environment.","So with that we'll now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Morning, Rod.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Had a couple questions. One is on the pricing. It looks like it came in at 2.1% this quarter. I know you've consistently guided to 2%, but it's been running lower up until recently. And was wondering if this is just growing electronics and software? And how you are looking at offsetting that?","And then also noticed that the FX\/commodity impact on the EBIT bridge was positive. Looked like it was negative on the top line. Is that somehow related to transactional effects, like the Euro appreciating versus the EE currencies? Or is that something else?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So why don't I start on the pricing? And then you can augment it, Joe, and then talk about FX and commodities.","So, Rod, with respect to guidance on pricing, we remain \u2013 our guidance in the range is 1.5% to 2% pricing. I think this quarter it was slightly higher than that, given our much faster growth in E&S over the next 12 months \u2013 growth is roughly double our overall corporate growth. And as we've talked about in the past, E&S tends to have price downs of 2% to 3% versus the balance of our portfolio that is less than 2%. And the rapid growth in that segment is what's driving the overall increase in price downs on a year-over-year basis. Other than that nothing has changed from a business model standpoint. Joe, do you want to...","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. Rod, on the FX commodities, as we mentioned a couple times during the prepared remarks, the RMB did impact us negatively during the quarter from both a revenue and OI perspective.","Apart from that everything else was fairly balanced out. We also did see about a $40 million headwind from copper, decreased copper pricing in the quarter. But as we've talked about before, that has a very low OI flow through, given the fact that we mostly have pass throughs to the customers and have the rest hedged out.","So revenue slightly bigger impact. OI, with the exception of the CNY, everything else sort of balances out.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But it did look like commodities and FX, if I'm reading your chart correctly, was like a $6 million positive, even though it was a negative on the top line. So something must have \u2013 is that a timing issue?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. It's \u2013 you've got it \u2013 I'm sorry. When I say balanced out, you've got \u2013 you do have about a $6 million positive and an about a $4 million net from FX, everything offsetting the RMB. And then about $2 million flow through for commodity.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And yeah. That would all be transactional related, Rod.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Transactional type stuff.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And then lag on the copper.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. And just lastly, could you just comment on how we should be thinking about the effect of launch costs over the course of this year, as obviously organic growth starts to accelerate? And there was an uptick in D&A this quarter. Is that something that we should assume as a run rate going forward?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, with respect to launch and the general trend \u2013 and I'll Joe talk about the specifics. As we talked about on our fourth quarter earnings call, we certainly saw the effect of China accelerated launch in Q4.","China is behind us in Q1. I think Joe referenced in his comments that effectively it was a $5 million headwind in Q1 going to $0. Launch costs in E&S and E\/EA, which declined from Q4 to Q1 and then will continue to decrease in Q2 and effectively go away in the back half of the year. Joe, do you want to?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. No, as I mentioned we're about $30 million in launch costs across E&S and E\/EA in Q1. Another $5 million for China. The $5 million does go away. This is the last quarter we'll have those inefficiencies, Rod. And then I think you start to see it \u2013 you will see it come down roughly $20 million in Q3 \u2013 I'm sorry, in Q2. And then below that in the Q3 and basically working our way out of it by the end of the year.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And the D&A?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The D&A, I do think you should think about that as a run rate, as we've put more capital in to support launches.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question is from John Murphy from Bank of America.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Morning.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Joe, just one follow up. You said $20 million on the op income line in the second quarter for the Japanese hit. Is that correct? And that probably just would equate to about $0.05 in the quarter? Is that about right?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. That's $20 million at the midpoint, about $0.06 of EPS.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Then just a second question. I mean there was relative strength in Europe, up 9%. I'm just curious if you're seeing anything going on there with mix or take rates on some of your product? And also in conjunction with that you kind of highlighted the idea that you had further cost rotation to low cost sourcing. I'm just curious what's going on on the revenue line there on mix? And then also on the cost side and the potential going forward?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, so I'll start it. Listen, in Western Europe we're seeing the benefits of a stronger market. I would say that's partially offset by weakening in Russia.","With respect to the strong growth I'd really tie it to market improvement, as well as just timing of launching new programs, John. I don't think it's anything particular to \u2013 or unique to content gains or anything like that.","With respect to footprint \u2013 and Joe should comment on this \u2013 we continue to aggressively attack our cost structure. A big piece of the restructuring that we've been doing over the last few years, and we'll continue to do, is focused on rotating footprint out of Western Europe into Eastern Europe. Joe?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. No. I think, John, as we've been able to do over the years, you've seen us maybe initially move the E\/EA or some of the E&S plants to Eastern Europe. We're now at the point where we can move some of the power train facilities, which have much more complicated manufacturing processes. But we've now built a base of power train capabilities in Eastern Europe. And we're starting to move those production activities east as well. So that's a continued process. And again I think in line with our overall best cost country rotation plan, as well as our margin outlook for the coming years.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So as we think about that though, I mean what's the opportunity? Because I mean it seems like a lot of that had been executed already. But this sounds like a good piece of news. I mean are you halfway done? Or three-quarters of the way done? And as we think about sort of a $7 per hour labor cost, I mean does this \u2013 could this potentially have a positive impact on that going forward?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think it'll certainly help us maintain our current labor dollars. As you think about just globally there's obviously ups and downs in labor economics. And in part we're doing this to sort of maintain our position. I would say as you think about power train, they're really in the first third of this rotation is the way I would think about it.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. And then...","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. I mean, John, if I can \u2013 so listen, everything we do has a \u2013 like just has a very positive return. So it's two things. It's one to Joe's point, it's about strategically positioning our footprint over the long term, so that we maintain the industry's most competitive cost structure. And it's all about driving increased returns.","So net-net, yeah, there's an incremental profit improvement impact that will flow through our numbers in the out years. So there certainly is a benefit on top of maintaining our current cost structure and actually improving it.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. And just lastly, I mean it just seems like there's some incremental wins going on here on infotainment. I'm just curious. Are you gaining market share there? And curious if you are, is that just purely because of content? Or is that also your ability to backward integrate \u2013 or to integrate, not backward, but integrate into the electrical architecture of the vehicle?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, listen, we don't really sell that as a package. I think underpinning everything we do from a vehicle electrification, system integration standpoint, I think we would tell you we're at a competitive advantage, given our electrical architecture capabilities. Because for it all to happen flawlessly, the electrical architecture is an important component on there. So internally we certainly partner and work together. But in terms of how we go to the customer, customers tend to buy specific products.","Our bookings in E&S have been close to $2 billion per year each year over the last 4 years. We'd expect to \u2013 actually over $2 billion. We'd expect to book roughly $2 billion again this year, which is roughly 2 times our current run rate from a revenue standpoint. Infotainment is going to be our fastest growing \u2013 or one of our fastest growing segments, growing roughly 20% over the next few years. That's faster than the overall market. I think we're benefiting from where we sit in medium and high end systems, where you see content growth. And then we're probably also gaining some share in certain markets.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's incredibly helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Johnson from Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about PureDepth, especially in the context of cockpit electronics and infotainment. Maybe a couple things. Where are you right now in terms of cockpit electronics, or what we would call dashboards? Second, how do you see that playing out in the next 3 years to 5 years along a couple dimensions? First, the transition from gauges and dials to flat screens, or I guess for you 3D flat screens? And then kind of when do you expect that inflection?","And second, to what extent will this be purchased by OEMs as a module along with the center stack infotainment? Or still a separate purchase?","And then finally, any details on PureDepth in terms of transaction amounts, if you could disclose it?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Joe can talk about the transaction amount. Why don't I start with where we are? Clearly, I think, Brian, as you know the cockpit's moving to digital. And what PureDepth gives us is effectively enhanced graphics and 3D capabilities.","I can tell you at the Consumer Electronics Show \u2013 and I know you visited our booth \u2013 the 3D graphics on the cluster we had got more attention from our customers than any other technology that we showed at CES, including our automated drive capability. So it is a very interesting technology that we're integrating into our cluster business.","Where we sit today, we sell clusters. We sell center stacks as you know with infotainment systems. You're going to see more display. You're going to see more glass in cars. We're convinced of that. You're going to see that happen over the next 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years.","And from our perspective it's important that we're well situated. And we believe we are. And we think that's reflected in our strong infotainment wins. The cluster business is a business that is for us not real large today, but it is growing rapidly. And we think PureDepth technology is something that'll help us advance our growth. Joe, do you want to?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. Brian, from a transaction perspective just a couple of things. Relatively small from a value perspective, about $15 million we paid for the acquisition of PureDepth.","We've worked closely with PureDepth, as CES showed over the last couple years. So we know them well. Integration was fairly easy. We've basically completed it. This isn't a deal that'll have a long run on integration. So it's now tucked in. And the development efforts are underway as \u2013 they are now a fully owned company versus just a \u2013 versus a development partner. So it was pretty much taken care of in the quarter.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just following up, a couple things. You mentioned it's not real large for you. Could you give us a sense of either your share of the global instrument cluster market? Or what share of E&S instrument clusters is?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","It's small. It's small.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And I guess second, the one question \u2013 because I know had a lot of them \u2013 is kind of who are the buyers at your OEMs for instrument clusters versus infotainment? And as they \u2013 as instrument clusters go digital, how is that shifting?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No. I think you're \u2013 today it varies a bit by customer. Some customers, they're separate buying groups and engineering groups. But they are increasingly becoming more integrated with the infotainment function.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So that is the trend, and it'll continue. Okay?","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Itay Michaeli from Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey, Itay.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Itay.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Maybe just a question on the organic growth in the second half of the year, given some of the moving parts around Japan and the backlog. Can you maybe help us think about Q3 and Q4? And also maybe what the rough backlog split is between the first half and second half this year?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, Itay. It's Joe. Obviously first quarter we saw a 6% organic growth. Second quarter we're right around 8%, just a little under 8%. Japan is worth about 2 points of that. So we basically \u2013 that negative is already included in the 8%. So we see that moving to the back half of the year.","Right now we see Q3, Q4 between 12% and 10% respectively. Those numbers get a little cloudy obviously though, just on a year-over-year comp basis, just given some of the activity you saw in China last year. But right now we're looking at 12% growth and 10% growth Q3, Q4.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. On a relative basis if you remember, China, very weak Q3, very strong Q4. And obviously those revenue growth numbers include some snap back related to...","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","To Japan.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Japan.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We're currently assuming, for lack of a better barometer, at this point just we picked up half in Q3, half in Q4. So it's about a point in each of the two quarters, Itay.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful. And then maybe just on the share buybacks. And I know, Joe, you mentioned that the first quarter rate shouldn't be modeled continuously throughout the year. But maybe any additional help in terms of how to model that the rest of the year? Should we assume maybe that that same ratio of free cash flow the next few quarters? Or is there some other guideline to think about?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I would \u2013 it's certainly not the Q3 activity we \u2013 I'm sorry, the Q1 activity. We were obviously fairly aggressive in Q1. Saw the dislocation in the marketplace. And as we've said we will be opportunistic as those things happen.","I think for a modeling perspective, Itay, to be honest I'd be around $50 million to $75 million per quarter. I think we're going to \u2013 we've got \u2013 we're going to be obviously continuing down the path of our capital allocation strategy. But we'll be mindful of M&A opportunities. And the stock has obviously come up off the lows that we saw in the February timeframe. So we'd be thinking $50 million to $75 million is probably the right \u2013 from a modeling perspective, realizing we will obviously reserve the right to be opportunistic as well go forward.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Lastly, quickly, maybe for Kevin. Just with the conquest wins that you've been able to have and $7 billion of Q1 bookings, any \u2013 I know it's still early in the year. But any initial thoughts of where maybe bookings can track this year relative to prior years?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. I would \u2013 Itay, I would expect bookings to be roughly at the levels that we did last year, $26 billion or a bit more. That can be affected by timing of awards, so I warn you on that. But given our current line of sight and given the number of opportunities and the estimated timing of those opportunities, we should be at roughly $26 billion or more.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful. Thanks, everyone.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey. Good morning, Patrick.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Patrick.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, just one quick follow-up on the Japan issue. I mean can you just dimension that a little bit for us? I know there was another company that's also infotainment that had an impact as well. And what's the visibility? I mean how broad based has this impact been on your supply chain? Are some of these facilities now beginning to kind of turn around and start produce? Like is there any visibility as to when they might come back online? What's your confidence on when that comes back?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Listen, I think there's a reasonable amount of visibility. But I would say the situation is evolving. Patrick, I think as an industry, from a supply chain standpoint, we do a very good job of \u2013 and this is across the board, this is supply base as well as the OEs \u2013 working together to identify where issues are and identifying either alternative sources to manufacture or substitute products that the OEs approve, to mitigate the overall impact of these types of situations.","So we all have a vested interest in ensuring there's as much visibility as possible. And that we're working together to resolve the problem to ensure that our OEs have the product to build the car. Joe, maybe you can comment more on the numbers?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. I think from a \u2013 again, as we look at the numbers, there's obviously a lot of dialogue with the suppliers. We have two suppliers. One's a little bit more significant than the other that's impacted here. Obviously talk to the customers as well.","I would say the \u2013 to put it in perspective. If you think back to the tsunami, there you had physical damage to manufacturing facilities. And that tended to be over a longer period of time. What we've been told so far and what we're seeing, this is more a case of damage to in-process inventory than the facilities themselves. So that gives us some confidence that the delays will be both shorter term in nature and recovery should be quicker.","At the midpoint we've estimated $75 million of revenue. That includes both direct \u2013 and it's about 50\/50 \u2013 both direct impact as well as indirect. So direct would be where we don't have supply and can't ship to a customer. Indirect, and GM is a good example of that, would be a case where a customer has told us they're impacted by another supplier and won't be producing. So therefore we're not going to ship to them either.","At the high end it could be $100 million of revenue and close to $30 million of OI. That's reflected in the low end of our guidance, so high end of Japanese risk, low end of our guidance. At the high end of our guidance range it's about $50 million in revenue and $10 million of OI.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And, Patrick, so we have a team of supply chain and manufacturing people who are \u2013 who have been in Japan now for weeks, working with the supply base there as well as with our customers, trying to develop and then ultimately implement solutions to any of these problems. So it's very proactive.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. No, appreciate all the details on that. Very helpful. Just one second question. I mean we've touched on it a little bit in this call so far. But can you just remind us, I mean obviously the CAGR that you've outlined in the infotainment business back at the Analyst Day of 20%, it's double your industry forecast of 10%. Double or pretty close to double ours as well. So can you just remind me? Clearly there has been a lot of content opportunity there and some share gains. But specifically, where are you winning business from others that's allowing you to see so much relative growth, if you will?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","When you look at growth in infotainment, it really for us, it's across the board by region. It's probably fastest growing, as you can imagine, in China off of a smaller number. When you think about the China market for us that's \u2013 for players like ourselves I'd characterize it as the perfect opportunity of solid vehicle production growth as well as when you look at mix of vehicles, they tend to be higher-end SUVs, crossovers, or sedans with significant content. And given the fact that they're significant content, and we're winning business in regions and areas like that, we're benefiting from that stronger, much stronger mix.","But we're also \u2013 we've won and we're launching big wins with some of the European OEs, both what I'd call the mass market as well as luxury, as well as here in the U.S.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Terrific. Appreciate the color, guys. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hi, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Maybe one more on PureDepth. Just from my quick Googling here this morning, it seems like there was a strong non-autos market focus prior to the acquisition, primarily in the sort of gaming and mobile industry. So I'm sure the motivation obviously is to enhance your technology capabilities and drive information systems. But like with HellermannTyton are you happy to continue with the non-automotive business as well? And then what is your general philosophy toward non-auto businesses that may sort of peripherally come along as you make I guess increasingly technology type acquisitions?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No, and listen, that's a great question. The original technology started in the gaming industry. And in fact we're not here to announce we're heading into gaming. The reality is that has been a technology that they defocused and is running off. And the sole focus is in the automotive space. But that is where their roots actually began, Ryan. So it's a very good question.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then just last one. I thought to check in with another quarter past the Volkswagen emissions issue, if you're seeing any sort of corollary uptick and interest in 48-volt products? Because there have been some articles recently discussing how, whereas Europe was maybe behind Japan and the U.S. in terms of electrification, that maybe now there is going to be a big inflection. So perhaps remind what is embedded in the long term guidance from the Analyst Day relative to electrification in Europe? And I'm curious if it already incorporates a big increase? Or whether there might be more upside, based upon your latest conversations?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, listen. I mean our outlook for electrification is, it's kind of high \u2013 what is it? Roughly 25% in 2025, a couple points of EV \u2013 20%. Sorry. 20% in 2025. About 2 points of that mix is pure EVs. The balance is hybrid and 48-volt. And our estimate is 48-volt is roughly half. So call it 9 points or 10 points. I think that reflects fairly rapid growth on the hybrid and 48-volt side.","If you look at HIS, and based on conversations with customers, that mix of EV and hybrids out in 2025 has actually increased over the last 6 months. And listen, I'd say there's maybe an opportunity that it accelerates further. Clearly there's more dialogue and more interest from our customers, as they focus on solutions to reducing CO2 emissions and increasing fuel economy. And things like 48-volt, where you can get a significant benefit at a fraction of the cost, it's a great value proposition. It's a terrific value proposition.","So we're having increasing dialogue, and it's really across the globe. It's not just in Europe and in North America. There's actually a couple customers in China that we're working with now on 48-volt systems solutions.","And what positions us really, really well as you think about it, being in the power train business and the Electronics and Safety, and then importantly in that Electrical Architecture business, we actually have solutions to every single aspect you need to provide a complete system solution to the OE.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question is from David Leiker from Baird.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hi, David.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Morning, David.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Kind of a follow up a little bit on the discussion that Ryan was just going through. In China and around the auto show and you walk the floor there, seems like much more interest in electrification than here in the U.S.","And I was just wondering if we could talk about the new energy vehicles as they're calling them and bringing them to market? And maybe you answered part of this. But a little bit more focus specifically in terms of the opportunity in China, where Delphi is positioned relative to competition there? And the products and technologies capabilities that you have that you can bring to market there?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sure. So when you think about it \u2013 let me start with as you noted, and you were just there. We've been in the China market for close to 25 years, serving the China market. And when you look at our capabilities everywhere from engineering, design, development, to manufacturing, I would say there isn't a supplier out there that has the same capabilities.","And we're localized in virtually all of our product lines. I think of our 33 product lines, where 30 or 31 are localized. So we have the full portfolio that we can provide to our customer base in region. And we can meet their needs from a design standpoint as well as a cost standpoint.","And I think that starts with electrical architecture. I think it's augmented with inverters and converters, battery packs, things like that, that we can bring to bear. And those products that we don't manufacture today like electric motors, there are partners that we're using strategically to sell the whole system solution.","When you look at the market if there is a market that is right for electrification, where it should be easier to implement, it's the China market. Based on discussions with both the globals as well as the local OEs, everyone is convinced that the government is focused on enforcing regulations and reducing CO2 emissions and addressing the pollution problem. So enforcement is there. The infrastructure investment is easy to make. And from a growth standpoint it probably is one of the biggest opportunities. We'll see how quickly it comes to fruition though, at this point in time.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. That's perfect. Thanks. And then just another item here on the ADAS, self-driving cars, autonomous vehicles. And just want to get a perspective of where you stand today on your capabilities to essentially provide a turn-key solution to an auto maker who might be found lacking a bit in the investment? Or behind the pack of some of the leaders in this space?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Are you at the point that you can offer a turn-key solution to an auto maker who wants to play catch-up?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. We can certainly offer a turn-key solution from a technology standpoint. And we are having dialogues with various parties with respect to that.","I think the challenge for both customers as well as folks like ourselves are kind of two-fold. Near term it's cost.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Right.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And it's how you sell commercially effective solution. And then second, it's the regulatory\/legal environment. And how you cross those various bridges. I mean as we said in the past the biggest challenge to get to fully automated is not going to be the technology or the cost. It's really going to be regulation and legal liability.","I think the important thing from our perspective as we said, we look at automated driving as quite frankly the far end of the spectrum on active safety. And what excites us most is getting to level two automated driving, which is fully commercialize-able today. You can get to 80% of the active safety benefits, so really at a fraction of the cost. And that is really why we're seeing the tremendous demand for active safety solutions.","As Joe mentioned in his comments, our active safety revenues grew 70% in the quarter. And we expect from a compounded growth rate standpoint over the next few years to grow it roughly 50%. And it's that sort of cost benefit analysis that's driving that growth.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Then thank you very much.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Colin Langan from UBS.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey, Colin.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Any color on the cadence of power train margins as we look out? You mentioned in the commentary there's a 40 basis point hit from FX. Should that continue through the year? Or should we see these margins start to recover?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Colin, it's Joe. I think the \u2013 just to touch on that. One of the things we are seeing in power train, and it ties in with the RMB discussion, power train does have some transactional FX exposure as it relates to RMB. And that's basically driven by the fact that our Chinese power train business does import for the heavy duty diesel business some of its products from our European and U.K. plants. So there is some transactional FX that impacts that business. That's really what's driving that 40 basis points.","That's going to be very RMB dependent. I would say apart from that, we are seeing the margin progression in power train that we would expect to, just given the volume increases and our typical levels of expected performance. So it's going to be RMB dependent. And it's very specific to that heavy duty business in China.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And current outlook for the year is roughly 25 basis points of margin expansion.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Basis points. Yeah. In power train.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And can you remind us your commercial truck exposure overall? And how much of it is in power train? I imagine they're more of an outsized exposure to commercial.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, our total \u2013 Commercial vehicle is about 10% of our full year volume, and about two-thirds of that roughly is in power train.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just on E&S I mean you mentioned in the commentary there's $30 million in launch costs between I guess E&S and E\/EA. I mean even if it's just half E&S, that's a pretty big margin hit for that segment. So does that give \u2013 should we be modeling in a pretty significant margin upside in the second half of the year as the $30 million shrinks down in the E&S segment?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Because that could be almost 200 basis points if you look at half of it this quarter?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. No. It is a significant piece in the quarter. I agree with that. I think our overall guidance for E&S remains unchanged. It's 25 basis points growth on a full year basis. And our guidance from the beginning of the year has incorporated these launch costs as I've talked about. We knew these launches were happening. They're not a surprise if you will. So we've factored that into our full year margin guidance. So that \u2013 using that 25 basis points expansion on a full year basis is what I would suggest.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just one last question on the impact from Japan. Is there any particular segment that's more impacted? Or is it across all three?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","All three see it. I would say the \u2013 if you think about the $75 million of revenue, roughly $40 million, $45 million of it's in E\/EA. That's not \u2013 it's in necessarily specific to E\/EA products. But E\/EA being such a large business picks up what I'll call some of the impact from our other Delphi businesses, particularly E&S losing direct supply. But it was also impacted by some of the indirect and particularly the GM pull ahead of the plants, the four plant shutdown from July to June is impactful to E\/EA. So E\/EA is the largest, although it tends to suffer more from indirect than direct is the way I would think about it.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question is from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, everybody. Hey.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey, Adam. How are you?","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good. How you guys doing?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good. Good.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, Kevin, a question here. Kind of high level. We're hearing a lot of auto executives, and I think yourself included, saying things like the automobile should change more in the next 5 years than in the last 50 years. I think you kind of like from a high level agree with that sentiment, right?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, I don't know if it's exactly 5 years.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. Right. No.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","But I think in general we're going to see a lot of change. Right.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. If we just take that ostensibly like at face value, one could argue that could mean that in 5 years or 7 years or whatever, that number of years, certainly within an engineering cycle, that cars on the road, all cars on the road are going to feel like they're 50 years old.","Now do you see \u2013 I'm just curious where you \u2013 and I know you don't have a crystal ball here. But curious kind of if your team at a high level from a production capacity and demand planning standpoint think about the possibility of this super cycle of accelerator placement demand as kind of buying a new car is seen as a lifesaving decision. And as more data comes out about the dangers of human driving unassisted, relative to what's available on the market and the great products you provide, whether there could be a movement and even kind of an effort in Washington even to say, listen, we got to get these death traps off the road and accelerate that. Just curious at a high level. I know it's not \u2013 a quasi-lobbying type question, but just does that get any air play with you?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Listen, I understand your point. I think you're going to see a tremendous amount of change, more digitization, more electrification, and quite frankly safer vehicles. And I'd argue first, Adam, we don't need to get all the way to fully automated to make that happen, right?","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Of course. Right.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I mean we can get to level two. And unfortunately governments don't move as quickly as markets do. And oftentimes as citizens and consumers want them to.","But it's certainly something that internally we're making sure that we have the capabilities. It's why we bought companies like Ottomatika. It's why we've invested in companies like PureDepth. It's why we have the 40 engineers in Silicon Valley. It's why I'm headed to Israel next week to meet with technology partners there.","So it's certainly something that we need to be ready for. And I think the challenge for players like us, who have commitments to folks like you and investors, is how do we strike the balance about making sure that we're perfectly positioned for the future? And at the same time ensuring that we're delivering acceptable financial returns between now and then?","And those are the tradeoffs that we constantly think about. But obviously there's more and more focus on software, on systems integration, on electrification. And there's far more investment in that area. When you look at advanced engineering for us as a percent of our total engineering, I think we're up 10% or 20%. And a big piece of that is investment in software.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, and maybe as a follow up then, not just investment in software but maybe investment in human beings. Can you kind of give a real time update of kind of where you're short \u2013 we obviously know that the competition for talent is brutal. And it goes \u2013 you overlap way, way beyond traditional auto industry in terms of trying to get the best people in the organization, competing with all sorts of other tech firms and software firms. But where are you kind of \u2013 where is that talent battle? Is it getting worse? And kind of where do you need people most, either by discipline or geography? And that's the question. Thanks.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, listen. Yeah. When you think about it from the most rapid growth from an engineering standpoint, it's clearly on software and systems. They're 25% of our \u2013 those engineers are 25% of our engineering work force to date. And I think we expected \u2013 Jeff [Owens] talked about it in our Investor Day \u2013 close to doubling that number over the next 5 years.","And that doesn't mean you need to do it in Silicon Valley. You can do it in places like Bangalore, where we're located, in places like Shanghai. We're looking at other locations to actually recruit and put those people. And quite frankly where it makes sense, we partner with outside service providers and leverage their capabilities.","But that's been our biggest focus. To be honest we haven't had a challenge in getting those people. It's not been a constraint. It's not getting in our way \u2013 gotten in the way of our product development or our revenue growth. I think part of that is because of the real interesting things we're doing from an automated drive standpoint, from an infotainment standpoint, from a systems integration standpoint. I think we benefited from that. And it's clearly something that we're very, very focused on.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, team.","Operator","Our next question is from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey, Joe. How are you?","Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. This is Jacob Hughes on for Joe. How you guys doing?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Jacob.","Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just had a couple of quick follow-ups. On commodities I mean you guys are saying nothing neutral year over year. Was there some sort of headwind or tailwind last year? Just trying \u2013 how to think about that.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. I think \u2013 let's \u2013 if we just back up, Jacob. The commodities for us is really a discussion around copper, particularly now that we've divested of Thermal.","Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So copper pricing continues to move down. We have for about 80% of our (1:00:39) pass through agreements with our customers. So we're neutral to price, but it does impact the revenue line. We pass through the exact price.","So you see it come down on revenue, but there's really no OI impact. So that's all we're talking about here. So as copper prices come down we do have less revenue, but it's really no \u2013 there's no impact on OI. Very minimal impact on OI. And what there is on OI is really just more of a timing than anything else.","Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And secondly, you obviously got some good news on tax that you gave at the Analyst Day. Did you guys evaluate any of this earnings stripping component with the IRS ruling? Does that impact your tax situation at all? Or does that not matter?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, that does not matter. None of those rules that came out over the last couple weeks, which were fairly targeted I think at acquisitions that were either in process or being contemplated, none of that impacts us at this point.","Jacob Hughes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question is from David Lim from Wells Fargo Securities.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, Kevin, Joe, and team.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey, David.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, David.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for all the great color. Just two questions. On the reconfigurable cluster, are you seeing OEMs trying to do like a package deal if you will with infotainment? And, Joe, I think you mentioned one-third of the rotation to best cost countries with power train has been completed. Is there a particular timeline on when that will be fully completed?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. Want me to go first? Then you can \u2013 sure. So we've kicked off \u2013 I said completed. It's in process. So over the next 2 years we'll see a rotation of a couple significant Western European power train plants east and some more consolidation. So it's really for us a 2016, 2017, maybe a little bit into 2018 event. So it's relatively short \u2013 as it goes from a European restructuring perspective, a relatively short timeline as we get those plants moved.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And then, David, I'll talk about \u2013 I think today there are customers that are talking about the integration between cluster and infotainment. They're not any that we're working with that are buying the two together as a package.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","It's headed in that direction ultimately. I think we'll get there. But we're not there at this point in time.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question is from Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hi, Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of remaining quick ones from me. On the active safety issue we're talking about revenues up 70%. And obviously since it's a small base I understand there's some lumpiness there. Are you seeing in general some sort of acceleration in terms of when you discuss with the auto makers, as a result of their commitment to make automatic emergency braking standard? Is that \u2013 are you seeing maybe a higher pace of adoption than you were seeing 6 months ago?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, listen, I'd tell you, I think the adoption of AEB creates some tailwind. I don't think it's the biggest driver. I think in reality when you look at it, we've been talking about it for probably the last 12 months to 24 months. It is a consumer-driven demand item. And as a result OEs are making sure that they have that capability in their product. And that's what's really driving the demand and continues to drive the demand. I'd tell you it continues to accelerate. But I think it's what our OEs need to sell the cars.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And then on your guidance slide, you have this interesting commentary that you're monitoring obviously a few factors including global production, FX, commercial vehicle, Japan impact. A lot of these factors seem like downside risks \u2013 and I know you were very clear that you're seeing in general the risks are pretty balanced here. What are sort of like the upside risks that you're sort of seeing that give you overall the comfort in your full year view?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I think that's a good way to think about it. Thematically we see Q1 as being very balanced. We see that continuing through the year. So we're \u2013 potential strength in China and European markets, Kevin mentioned that, at this point being somewhat offset by Brazil and the commercial vehicle space, particularly CV in North America. But again, balanced.","So I think the chart on slide 19 hopefully is communicating a fairly balanced look at this point. And again, where we're comfortable with where we are on a full year outlook.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, Emmanuel, I'd tell you if I were to take a step back and look at things, if you look at the first quarter as an example, and you adjust for FX, we're at the very top end of our revenue range. We're at the top end of our OI range. And we're certainly at the top end of our EPS range. And I think if you do the same sort of look at our Q2 guidance and adjust it for the Japan earthquake issue, you're in a similar situation. So listen, we feel good about where the market is.","The point on Joe's slide, we watch everything. Right? And we make sure that we can react to everything. And fortunately we have a cost structure that is very flexible that we can move very quickly on. We control all of our joint ventures in China. So we make the tactical as well as strategic decisions to ramp up or ramp down. So we're in control. And because we're in control, we monitor and react to everything that's out there and want to be in front of things versus behind them.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","That's great to hear. Then just one last housekeeping if I may. In the \u2013 when you first initiated the guidance at the Detroit auto show, I think the underlying share buyback was $400 million for the year. You've done obviously $370 million as of Q1.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","What's embedded in the current guidance?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I answered that question earlier for Itay I believe. So I would \u2013 at this point if you're thinking about outgoing quarters, Q2, Q3, Q4, I'd be ranging $50 million to $75 million per quarter.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Stover from SIG.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey, Matt. How you doing?","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks. I'm very well. I hope you guys are well.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Two questions. If I look at the E\/EA, the margins continue to be really, really strong there. I know the copper effect kicks in. You probably get some synergy. But if you could kind of walk through the walk year to year, that would be helpful.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. So for the full year E\/EA walk, just to be clear, Matt?","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","No, just the quarter.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Just the quarter?","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. Hold on one second here.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And then if you're looking for something.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Another question, just a bigger picture on backlog. It's always hard for me to make sense of the bookings number. And if I look at \u2013 I tend to look at it on a rolling four quarter basis. And I know this stuff can be lumpy. But if you look at the rolling four quarter into the first period, it looks like you've seen a noticeable decline. And I'm just wondering if there was activity that would normally have been taking place in the first quarter that perhaps shifted? Or how we should think about that?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. No, that's a great question. Why don't I start with that, Matt?","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Last year in our $10 billion booking for the first quarter, we had a $3 billion win with a large global OE. So I would say that would have skewed \u2013 that would have significantly skewed bookings in the first quarter of last year.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, Matt, if you walk through the E\/EA walk, Q1 2015 to Q1 2016.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Strong material performance, call it about $30 million. Strong SG&A just again, just year-over-year performance of about $10 million.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Somewhat offset by the launch of the engineering costs that we're talking about. So think about that as, that's about $50 million of upside and about $10 million, $15 million of that is coming out in engineering and the launch cost stuff.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I mean as you look at it, I think our outlook for the year is E\/EA will \u2013 margin expansion will be roughly 75 basis points, right, on a year-over-year basis.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. Yeah.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Which is solid revenue growth. We'll have very solid margin expansion. And I think it really \u2013 and we can go through all the details. But it really comes down to execution. It's the benefit of volume flow through. They're an organization that operate very, very well. And to the extent you put volume through the machine, that machine tends to convert it into earnings.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And we're seeing the benefit from that.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Chris McNally from Evercore.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey, Chris.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys. Just a quick follow one on the organic incremental margin. In Q1 the way you guys reported it, it was roughly 30%. It's been tracking in that 30% sort of range for the last couple of quarters. You had some headwinds in China. Can we assume that that number may have some upside as we get into the second half of the year, particularly as the higher R&D from the new programs in Q1 sort of subside?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, I think Joe can be specific. I think as the year rolls out in the exception based on our assumption for the Japan earthquake is really Q2. But if you normalize for that we would expect to continue to see \u2013 and I think on a sequential basis you actually do \u2013 year-over-year margin expansion quarter to quarter.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And it's a result of the roll through or flow through of the items that Joe had talked about earlier, Joe?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, you're right. The drop through on the sales growth was in line with historical trends. That does bounce around a little bit, but where we would have expected it to be. Margin progression through the year, heading to our 50 basis points expansion year over year will accelerate as we get to the back half of the year.","So I think \u2013 and that's effectively the same things we're talking about. The volume picks up. Performance gets better. In part we perform better in the back half of the year, as our initiatives start to pick up on a full run rate basis. And we also get out of the launch costs that we've been talking about in Q3 and Q4","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Perfect. So the launch costs basically, there is some in Q2 still? But then essentially they fall off in Q3 and Q4?","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Effectively. They fall off. There's some still in Q3, and then they fall off in Q4. But it's \u2013 they're down. They cut themselves in half by Q3 and basically gone in Q4.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So remember, Joe referenced in his presentation, roughly $35 million of launch and China costs in Q1, declining to $20 million in Q2, and then falling off from there in Q3 and Q4.","Joseph R. Massaro - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Perfect. Thanks so much, guys.","Kevin P.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Delphi Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions).","I would now like to turn over our call over to Jessica Holscott, Delphi's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jessica, you may begin your conference.","Jessica L. Holscott","Thank you, Wright, and thanks for joining Delphi's second quarter earnings call. To follow along with today's presentation, our slides can be found at delphi.com under the Investors section of the website. ","Please see slide two for a disclosure on our forward-looking statements, which we will be making on today's call and only reflect Delphi's current view of future financial performance, which may be materially different from our actual performance. ","Joining us today will be Rodney O'Neal, Delphi's CEO and President; as well as Kevin Clark, our CFO. As seen on slide three Rod will begin with an overview of the quarter, followed by Kevin, who will review our financial results in greater detail, discuss our 2014 outlook, and then we'll open up the line for Q&A.","With that I'd like to turn it over to Rod.","Rodney O'Neal","Thanks Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our continued strong operating performance resulted in record financial results. And as we have in the past Delphi will continue to deliver on the strategic imperatives that drive shareholder value.","Let's move to slide five and before I get into the slide, just let me start our perspective on the current macro environment. Overall our view is that this year\u2019s global vehicle production will increase roughly 3% to just under 91 million units, I expect the U.S. economy to remain relatively strong which should translate into approximately 5% growth here in North America vehicle production. Europe has continued to stabilize and we expect roughly 2% growth for the region and we remain very bullish with the China market, which we expect to expand in the high digit growth rates. The macro environment in South America well, it just continues to deteriorate. We expect vehicle production to decline roughly 15% and as a result we are implementing further restructuring actions to reduce our footprint in this region.","Now let\u2019s just move on second quarter highlights, as I said we had a great quarter; revenue was up by 5%, OI was up 7%, earnings per share up 15%. We returned almost $300 million to shareholders, $220 million in stock repurchases as well as dividends of $76 million. And we remain confident in Delphi and our outlook for 2014.","Let's go to slide six, now this slide is a validation of our ability to execute flawlessly as we continue to receive accolades from our customers. So if you look at the chart, you can see a few examples of the awards that we received this year from a very diverse group of customers. It\u2019s also important to note the number of awards from our fastest growing region, China, China continues to be a very important of our growth strategy. So recognition from our customers there is key. These awards underscore our technology and operational leadership in all areas of our product portfolio.","Let's go to slide seven, so we translate the success we have with our customers into strong financial results and increased shareholders returns. In addition, as I stated before, we further enhanced share value through a very balanced and disciplined capital allocation plan. Through 2016, Delphi would generate roughly $8 billion of operating cash flow. We continue to invest in the businesses, execute on opportunistic share buyback, increase the dividend aligned with earnings growth and execute accretive transactions.","Slide eight, our Q2 bookings were in line with the customer cadence for new business opportunities. We remain confident that we will achieve our target of approximately $26 billion for this year. Our second quarter booking highlights include electrical architecture awards of over $3 billion, a powertrain award Great Wall motors for a diesel common rail in China, almost $1 billion of electronics and safety awards with a nice balance between entertainment and safety, and thermal awards totaling approximately $500 million with several different customers, including BMW.","Slide nine, our priorities for this year remain unchanged and we are focused on one thing and one thing only that is increasing shareholder value. We do this through disciplined revenue growth, further optimizing operating footprint and aggressively rationalizing our cost structure. The introduction of the various technologies that provide solutions to our customer\u2019s challenges all of which will turn its way into expanded margins and increased earnings. And we continue to drive increased shareholder value by deploying capital in a very disciplined manner. ","With that I will turn the call over to Kevin to go through the numbers.","Kevin P. Clark ","","Thanks a lot, Rod. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering our second quarter results, and then provide third quarter and updated full-year guidance. Consistent with our prior earnings call, today's review of our actual and forecasted results will exclude all restructuring and other non-recurring costs. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are included at the back of both this presentation and the press release for your reference.","So let me begin at slide 11 with a snapshot of our second quarter financial performance, which Rod briefly touched on. Revenue was in line with our expectations, primarily driven by strong growth in China and North America partially offset by significant weakness in South America. Reported revenue totaled almost $4.5 billion, that\u2019s an increase of 5%. Adjusting for the effects of FX and commodity prices, revenues increased roughly 3.5%, that's two points over Delphi target market. Operating income increased to $547 million and operating margins expanded 20 basis points to a record 15.3% which translates into 15.5% EBITDA margins. ","Net income increased over 11% to $432 million, reflecting earnings growth and a lower quarterly tax rate. Earnings per share increased 15% to $1.42 and lastly the operating cash flow totaled $627 million. I will cover each of these items further in my presentation. ","So let's move to slide 12 and I'll review second quarter revenue in greater detail. As I mentioned, reported revenue was in line with our expectations increasing 5% to almost $4.5 billion. Price downs of 1.4%, and lower copper pricing pass-throughs totaled $73 million, representing almost a two point headwind to year-over-year growth. These headwinds were largely offset by FX, which added $79 million to revenues and lastly volume totaled $205 million, adding five points of growth.","From a regional perspective, European revenues were as forecasted during our last earnings call, largely unchanged from the prior year; the result of solid growth in our electronics and safety and thermal segments, partially offset by lower revenues in our electrical architecture and powertrain segments, where lower automotive aftermarket revenue more than offset revenue growth with our OEM customers. ","North America revenues increased over 7% primarily driven by very strong growth in our electrical architecture segment. Revenues in Asia continue to be very strong, increasing 13%, driven by 15% revenue growth in China. And revenues in South America declined almost 24%. That's a little more than our original expectations reflecting lower revenues across each of our segments as a result of the weakening macro environment. We will discuss this region in more detail when we review our third quarter and full year outlook.","Slide 13 reconciles the year-over-year change in operating income, which increased $34 million or almost 7% to $547 million. The increase was the result of solid operating performance, flow-through in revenue growth and benefits from FX, partially offset by price downs, increased depreciation and amortization expense and increased investments in information systems and engineering. As I already mentioned, operating margins increased 20 basis points 12.2% and EBITDA margins expanded 33 basis points to 15.5%.","Slide 14, includes our segment results; Electrical architecture\u2019s adjusted revenue totaled almost $2.2 billion. That\u2019s up just under 6% from the prior period, driven by continued strong growth in North America and Asia, partially offset by lower revenues in Europe and South America. Segment operating income increased 12% to $298 million, representing 13.8% operating margins, that\u2019s up 80 basis points from the prior year, primarily the result of flow-through on revenue growth and continued very strong operating performance.","Revenue in our Powertrain segment totaled just under $1.2 billion, roughly flat year-over-year, the result of solid revenue growth with our OEM customers, principally in Europe and North America, offset by lower sales of aftermarket product driven by continued markets weakness in Europe. Segment operating income declined slightly to $142 million and operating margins totaled 11.9%, the result of increased investment in information systems and engineering as well as depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by solid operating performance. ","In our Electronics and Safety segment, revenue totaled over $743 million, representing nearly a 3% increase over the prior period, driven by very strong growth in Asia-Pacific, partially offset by lower revenues in South America and the effect of the continued rationalization of our reception systems and mechatronics product portfolio which represented roughly a three point headwind to this segment\u2019s growth rate. Segment operating income totaled $89 million and operating margins decreased to 11.8%, the result of flow-through in sales growth offset by increased engineering spend. ","Thermal revenues increased 5.1% to $392 million driven by solid growth in Europe, Asia and North America, partially offset by lower revenues in South America. Operating income totaled $18 million and operating margins increased to 4.5%, that\u2019s up 130 basis points over the prior year, representing the third straight quarter of sequential margin improvement. We expect to exit the year with operating margins approaching 5% in this segment.","Turning to slide 15, earnings per share increased 15% to $1.42 driven by increased earnings, lower share count, and a three point reduction in effective tax rate to 14%. ","Moving to the balance sheet and capital deployment on slide 16, we continue to maintain strong balance sheet. Debt totaled $2.5 billion and cash decreased about $200 million from the beginning of the year to just under $1.2 billion, reflecting the normal seasonal investment in working capital and the timing of CapEx spent and over $500 million of share repurchases and dividends. As a result, net debt increased to $1.3 billion representing a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.5 times."," ","As Rod mentioned we remain committed to executing a very balance and disciplined capital allocation plan, the M&A environment has improved and we continue to pursue value accretive transactions. We\u2019ve come close to executing transactions couple of times this year. However we remain very disciplined and to the extent we cannot execute on a transaction that meets our strategic and financial criteria during the balance of the year, we will accelerate our pace of share repurchases from the second quarter levels. ","Slide 17 details some of the assumptions underlying our updated 2014 guidance, As Rod has already discussed we\u2019re forecasting global vehicle production of just under 91 million units. That represents a 3% increase in global production. Looking at our forecast by region in North America our guidance assumes a 5% increase in production. We\u2019re forecasting European production to increase roughly 2%, that reflects improvement in the Western Europe market, partially offset by decline in vehicle production in Eastern Europe.","In China we\u2019re expecting production growth of 9% and in South America we\u2019re forecasting a 15% decline in production, due to continued deterioration of the macro environment, which is reflected in our third quarter customer build schedules. In light of the continued weakness in the market we have implemented restructuring initiatives in this region to further reduce our cost structure. For the third quarter, we are forecasting global vehicle production of a little less than 22 million units, that's up roughly 4% over last year or just over 3% on a Delphi weighted market basis.","Turning to slide 18 to discuss our 2014 full-year guidance, we expect revenues to be in the range of $17.2 billion to $17.6 billion, reflecting 6% growth, roughly two to three points over the underlying market. Based on year-to-date results and the economic uncertainty in South America we currently do not expect our revenues to exceed the midpoint of our guidance range. On a segment basis, we expect revenue growth in our electrical architecture segment to slow during the back half, reflecting the timing of roll-off and roll-on of new vehicle programs. In contrast revenue growth in our powertrain segment is expected to continue to accelerate driven by the ramp-up of new gas and diesel programs, partially offset by continued softness in the automotive auto market primarily in Europe.","Electronic and safety revenue growth is also expected to accelerate, principally in fourth quarter driven by the continued strong growth of active safety products which we foresee -- which we forecast increased roughly 30% year-over-year, partially offset by the continued headwinds related to the rationalization of our reception system and mechatronics portfolio that I mentioned a little earlier.","Lastly we expect thermal revenues to continue to grow 6% in the back half of the year. We\u2019ve increased our outlook for operating income to a range of $2 billion to $2.05 billion which includes $600 million of depreciation and amortization expense reflecting 11.6% of operating margins and 15.1% EBITDA margins. We have increased our EPS guidance to a range of $4.95 to $5.10 reflecting the strength of year-to-date earnings, a 17% effective tax rate and a share count of 304 million. Cash flow before financing is expected to total roughly $1.1 billion with CapEx still expected to be $800 million. ","Turning to the third quarter we expect revenues to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion reflecting a 6% increase year-over-year. Operating income will be in the range of $450 million to $480 million representing margins of 10.7 to 11.2%. EPS will be in the range of $1.10 to $1.18 assuming 303 million shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of roughly 18%. So with that we would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","","Good morning everyone."," ","Rodney O\u2019Neal","Good morning Rod.","Kevin P. Clark","Good morning Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Couple of questions, first just on the outlook as you\u2019re looking out to the back half, if the powertrain and the electronics and safety businesses accelerate in the back half, what -- could you just talk to us about what that means for incremental margins? My recollection is that, that those -- the incrementals on those businesses are a little bit above the company average.","Rodney O\u2019Neal","Yeah, I will start with it Rod. Yes, when you look at the Powertrain business especially relative to the mix of Delphi's overall business the incremental margins generally are stronger. You will see stronger flow through on revenue in Q3 especially strong flow through on Q4 or in Q4. A bit of that can be offset by continued investment in IT and engineering. But you will see stronger net flow through on the back half of the year.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay, but doesn't at least preliminarily, didn't look to me like you guys were anticipating better incrementals in the back half. Could you just talk a little bit about and I think you said before like $100 million to $120 million of savings from restructuring and $90 million of higher R&D and IT spending. So what's the sort of cadence of that as you are working through these efforts this year?","Rodney O\u2019Neal","Yeah I think part of what you probably have to keep in mind as you look at and maybe an easier way to talk about it is margin rate, operating margin rates in the back half of the year, principally Q3 and Q4 and year-over-year change. As you know in the third quarter you have summer shutdowns in North America as well as in Europe. You slow down production and then ramp production backup. So naturally you don't operate as efficiently as you do during your other quarters. So there is cost associated with that, that ramp down in volume and the ramp up volume. ","I think as it relates to margin rate you will see sequentially a decline in margin rate in Q3 versus Q2 which is logical trend in our business. Then you will very strong flow-through in operating margins in Q4. A part of that is volume related, a part of that relates to restructuring and synergy benefits as you talked about it and a part of it again relates specifically to the mix of business.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Okay and just lastly could you just remind us it is the aftermarket business in Europe has been a pretty big drag, size that business for us and how significant is that then and any additional color on the types of things that you are looking for when you are assessing acquisitions, what businesses would you be targeting.","Rodney O\u2019Neal","Sure, starting with your last question, in terms of M&A focus it hasn't changed. It really in there around electrical architecture, powertrain and electronics and safety. We have looked at and are looking at opportunities across each one of these segments. As it relates to our aftermarket business, it\u2019s roughly a $1 billion business, about half of that revenue sits in Europe. A significant portion of those revenues relate to powertrain products, roughly 70% of revenues are powertrain products that we manufacturer or resource and stuff and it has been, given the market conditions in Europe, it has been a business that we have seen year-over-year reduction in revenues over the last 12 months. We expect that trend to change beginning in Q4 of this year as we ramp up some new programs.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is open.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Yeah, couple of question, in therm can you just remind us the rough impact of South America in terms of revenue mix by segment and therefore kind of when we think about the segment growth where South America has had a disproportionate effect?","Kevin P. Clark","Yeah, well South America in total is about 5%, 6% of our -- of total Delphi revenues. We were down across each and every one of our segments in South America. I\u2019m trying to grab the numbers right now, Brian but for Q2 our powertrain segment was down couple of points, our thermal segment was down roughly 25% to 30% of revenues, E&S was down north of 30% and then our EA segment was down roughly in line with the market about 25%. ","Our biggest player when you look at revenues for South America, roughly $200 million of revenues during the quarter, about half of that sits in our electrical architecture segment. ","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Okay, and kind of second sort of related to headwind question, can you talk to me next about the roll off mechatronic and other things? I guess two questions. One when is that roll off through, is it that something that continues through second half 2015 and second are there other roll-offs to come in other segments that we should be aware of when doing growth [walks]?","Kevin P. Clark","Yeah, it's a trend that we would expect to continue through the first half of next year at roughly the same sort of rate that we talked about this year which is about three point headwind. It's factored into our revenue outlook quite frankly we have given regarding E&S in the past. But we thought it important to give you added visibility to it. Within the E&S division there are no other product lines that are of that size or have that impact and really there with respect to the rest of our segments there aren't -- there are no product lines that have that sort of a headwind impact or trend.","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Okay and final question, a bit more strategic, press reports confirmed by the parties that TRW and ZS are talking. It would appear to be outside of electric steering where is overlap, largely a diversifying acquisition for ZS. In fact some press reports said that their key goal was to bulk up, become and therefore better able to resist price downs from other from OEM customers. I am just wondering how you -- does that change anyway your M&A logic, what\u2019s your position on diversifying acquisitions versus deepening or further focusing the Delphi portfolio?","Rodney O\u2019Neal","I think we have been pretty clear since we went public with our story about how we would approach acquisitions and I think our strategy of bolt-ons is the right one and not trying to getter bigger for sake of bigness. Again when you look at price down, at 1.4% this quarter, it's been in 1.5% almost since our -- we began communicating that 1.5%-2%. It\u2019s one of the lowest in the industry, and the way we plan on protecting our position is not through size but through products that have deep and wide modes from a pricing perspective and so I don't view our acquisition as a differential strategy but it will be a augmental strategy in terms of on-grading our product portfolio. So I guess net-net our bolt-on description on how we would view acquisitions in the space that Kevin outlined powertrain, safety, electronics, software those kind of areas is still the main driver.","Kevin P. Clark","Yeah, and Brian I think to the extent there is diversification it would be in those product areas, powertrain, electrical architecture and E&S, in those product areas where we have strong technical capabilities and it's expanding our product portfolio or it\u2019s taking our existing product portfolio and moving it into markets that are relatively close to the automotive and commercial vehicle market. ","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning guys.","Kevin P. Clark","Good morning John.","Rodney O\u2019Neal","Good morning John.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a follow-up on M&A, I mean Kevin you alluded to being involved a bunch of potential transactions this year. Just curious, when you think about the size of those transactions, I mean are you looking at sort of MVL type of acquisitions as bolt-ons sort of $1 billion revenue companies or are they much more than that?","Kevin P. Clark","It's a good question John. It really ranges I mean from small as a couple of hundred million to as large as a billion dollars or little bit more.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But that $1 billion range is where you kind of would limit bolt-ons. I mean as you get above that it becomes a more -- I mean not completely transformational but that would be\u2026","Kevin P. Clark","Yeah, I think it depends quite frankly on what the business is, what their product lines are and the level of integration is. I would say to the extent we get -- approach a transaction that's above $1 billion or a bit above $1 billion obviously it's something we take a step back and further scrutinize.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And you would be willing to take on a decent amount of leverage to do a larger deal if it made sense.","Kevin P. Clark","Well I think we would be willing to increase our leverage as long as there is a path back down to deleverage, so that we could maintain our investment grade rate ratings.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Then just a second question, if we think about South America and you guys alluded to restructuring down there. Obviously it's a small part of the overall business. I mean how much restructuring are you going to doing, what does it really entail, it really just entails downsizing and really ultimately what is sort of the necessity for you to be in South America.","Kevin P. Clark","Well I will comment on the size of restructuring and Rod will comment on the strategy. With respect to incremental restructuring initiatives in this quarter, the charge will be roughly $34 million. A bulk of that will relate to initiatives in South America, principally Brazil. It's primarily headcount reduction. Our plan is to take a fairly significant reduction in overall headcount in that region, in light of the weak volume environment today and what we are forecasting to be a weak market on a go-forward basis.","Rodney O\u2019Neal","And the reason we are there obviously is because many of our global customers, particularly with some of the global platforms, we have to service in that region. So that's why we are there. It has been, it will continue to be an important market of -- as we all have seen over the years, it does tend to come and go. It\u2019s a very big piece and so we just -- we can't exit but we can minimize our presence and that's where we are particularly until these governments down there do some things to make the fiscal policies a bit more conducive for capital influx. So that's why we are there.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay and then just lastly if you look at the margins in the quarter, I mean they were the best that we have seen in any quarter really in last four or five years and there is always this question of you reach some -- product limit or not, you\u2019re behind on margins and you just keep going higher and higher. Do you think at this point you are sort of inflaming any attention from your customers or is there the potential for continuing margin expansion, particular as the mix of your business improves the higher margin product.","Rodney O\u2019Neal","Sure, thanks for first of all recognizing the margin expansion and I think all that we are doing is proving out what we said we would do, which was we [thought] our margins although that wouldn't be where we would say that would be our end destination, we thought we could get to 16% range. And I believe we said we\u2019ll get there by 2016. And so all you are seeing is the movement in the direction that we said, we do. The team is doing an excellent job of executing on the plan that we laid out. ","And so I still think there is room for expansion, particularly as I go through, visit the various regions and parts of our company. As good as we are there\u2019s improvement for us to do better as a result we are not maxed out in terms of being able to bring more cost out this machine. And so I feel good about that. ","In terms of customers looking at our margins to be quite frank and my dialog with the customers are pretty complementary in the way we run our business and we\u2019re not as focused on our margins as they are on the market cost. So there I mean we have a very competitive product portfolio. So I would -- I don't see the pressures of being anymore because we make money. I mean after the prices I think there is an appreciation of a supplier that can create tremendous return. So we don't see any more pressures than we ever have in terms of the commercial line of sight.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's great news. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup","Great thanks, good morning, everyone.","Rodney O\u2019Neal","Good morning.","Kevin P. Clark","Good morning. ","Itay Michaeli - Citi","Just on electrical architecture another strong margin quarter. I think you are north of 16% now on the year. Maybe talk a little bit about that, the drivers there, maybe how much of it was favorable regional mix with Asia being strong? Then how should we think about 2016, I mean it's potential upside to your previous target of 16% margin in 2016?","Kevin P. Clark","Listen, Itay it's Kevin, the electrical architecture business continues, as Rod commented earlier, executed extremely well. We are getting the balance of flow-through in volumes. We are operating extremely well. We are getting the benefits of improved mix partly as the result of the MVL acquisition and the impact of selling more connectors, certainly delivering on the MVL synergies. So it's a basic story of a combination of delivering on the revenue growth and the operating execution. I think as we look at our larger margins in that business -- that we got to revisit what the longer term targeted margins, I think we are there. We will update people on that next year. ","As it relates to margins by and he talked about mix of revenue growth and profitability. Again when you look at Delphi and you look at revenue mix by region, the profitability or margins are actually fairly tight around the corporate average, given the weakness in South America this last quarter, margins there certainly have deteriorated but on a more normalized basis. They tend to group around the corporate average and that's true with the electrical architecture segment. So it really is not regional mix.","Itay Michaeli - Citi","Great, that's very helpful and just secondly on slide 13, just on the net performance versus price down, I think this is maybe the third quarter in a row where that relationship has been slightly negative. With the restructuring you are doing do you expect that to normalize in the next several quarters or even couple of years towards sort of even or do you think you can kind of grow to your margin targets with that kind of remaining slightly negative.","Kevin P. Clark","Yeah, you are going to see -- you will continue to see improvement especially in the back half of the year. You got to remember, we talked about spending incremental dollars on information systems and engineering growth related investment on a year-over-year basis. That chart includes about $10 million of that and if you recall last year we talked about some one-time items in E&S and our powertrain segment totaled roughly $10 million. I think when you normalize for those two items you get much closer to closing that gap between price downs and performance.","Itay Michaeli - Citi","","Great and just one last quick housekeeping, any sense of what the backlog contribution was in the first half of the year, I think the $800 million or so full year.","Kevin P. Clark","I haven't looked at it. It would be weighted towards the back half of the year quite frankly just given timing of launch schedules. Roughly you look at it, roughly 65% or 70% of our launches happen in Q3, Q4 versus the front half of the year.","Itay Michaeli - Citi","Perfect, great. Thanks so much everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan, your line is open.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Regarding the thermal business, it looks like the improving revenue trend that emerged in 4Q has continued and EBIT margins were actually up there I think 130 basis points, after declining year-over-year for something like eight out of the last nine quarters. So can you talk about what is driving this improvement trend and how you expect it to progress and then maybe separate to that, if you could sort of remind us of your latest thoughts relative to corporates and non-corporate thermal and if that is impacted at all by the improving performance?","Rodney O\u2019Neal","Yeah, I think what you are seeing in the thermal improvement, what we said were that, one, the topline would improve because the team had achieved a considerable amount of diverse bookings in the past and that's starting to roll on. And so what you are seeing is the topline expanding as the result of the business rolling on. And then you get the multiplying effect of improved operational performance and so as you go through the motions of actually removing cost, executing on the launches and sort of drastically with top line moving and the cost coming out, you just see things moving north. So we expect that cadence to continue its northward trend and as you recall out our objective is to be double-digit EBITDA margins in that business."," ","Kevin P. Clark","So I can add in there, as I said in my prepared comments, we would expect to exit the year with operating margins at or around roughly 5% EBITDA margins of roughly 8.5%. So we expect to continue to see some improved performance in that business, partly driven by just solid execution.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Okay. Great thanks and then just on the new business bookings can you kind of talk about the fact that they are not higher year-over-year. Is this maybe just a function, I mean is it a function of maybe being more selective relative to the margin profile of business you are willing to take on. Or you have not really change anything there and it\u2019s just due to some sort of normal lumpiness or variability in pace of bookings?","Kevin P. Clark","I think it\u2019s all of the things you talk about and so just in the cadence, the normal cadence what we are seeing but we are very selective because it's very important to be that in this business and so it's all of the above but primarily it's just the cadence of the programs that are probably rolling out this year."," ","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Okay, that's fair and then just last question then on organic growth versus industry. Obviously you are out performing in North America and Asia inline with South America, Europe was a bit below again. In the past you have pointed some explanatory factors there such as the greater portion of commercial vehicle or after market exposure, sometimes you\u2019ve talked about changing mix of diesel versus gas. Just you just kind of share how those factors fared during the quarter and how they might fare going forward and then if possible too can you just kind of cut to the chase, sort of say what your organic growth is for the OV light vehicle business in Europe, which is what may be like 70% or so I think of your revenue there, how that trended maybe versus the industry, was up 2% or so for HIS?","Kevin P. Clark","Yeah, I\u2019ll make sure get all the questions here. So listen, I think when you talk about headwind in Europe for the quarter it really a couple of -- the primary aspect for us as a business was the automotive aftermarket. Weak market, our revenues were not strong in that market. We talked about -- that\u2019s a segment that or a division that has roughly $500 million of this $1 billion of revenues in Europe. So we were affected by that slower market. You exclude automotive aftermarket. We grew roughly at vehicle production in Europe. So OEM growth was at production, slightly stronger than that in our powertrain, our E&S and thermal businesses, a bit below that in our electrical architecture business, when you look at customer mix.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan","Great, that's very helpful to know. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shankar from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ravi Shankar - Morgan Stanley","Thanks, good morning everyone. Just a couple of questions on E&S again. So the year-on-year step down in margins and even the revenue growth is a little bit below what you were expecting. Was that entirely attributable to the mechatronic business and can you give us little more color there on why that transitions happening and what the margins of the business is like?","Kevin P. Clark","You are asking what's the growth for our -- the year-over-year in E&S business was exactly in line with what our expectations were as we headed into the fourth.","Ravi Shankar - Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Kevin P. Clark","I would say it was a bit stronger in all regions with offset in South America. So [nettings] are coming in line. The headwind as it relates to reception systems in mechatronics was as forecasted, as expected. I would say no surprises at the end of the day there, Ravi.","Ravi Shankar - Morgan Stanley","Got it and why is the mechatronic transition happening? Is that you\u2019re giving up that business because you think it's not necessarily value added or is there something happening at the customer side?","Rodney O\u2019Neal","Well, as a reminder one of the things that we said we were doing with that business and its portfolio was rotating away from the traditional more hardware and more software, visiting more sensing areas. And so this really part of the portfolio realignment to increase margins and above all drive return on invested capital. And remember I think (inaudible) as it is that we talked return on invested capital in this business would be breathtaking and I think it's proving to be true. So that's really all we are doing probably is continuing that journey and we are just doing what we said we are going to do.","Ravi Shankar - Morgan Stanley","That's a good point Rod. So if you were to look at the E&S business is it possible quantify what percentage of revenues today comes purely from software and what's the margin on that portion of business might be?","Rodney O\u2019Neal","A lot of the software is embedded into the product. In terms of our, the pure play, that's just starting -- do we have the pure -- we don't really do it that way. It's embedded in lot of our products but I guess we\u2019ll come back to you on it, Ravi what do you think. ","Kevin P. Clark ","A lot of it embedded in our product. ","Rodney O\u2019Neal","It\u2019s not as if as we are producing some of the hardware now, we just buy it and we create the value through the software and make it work. And so that\u2019s what you see in lot in our portfolio in this business. We will come back to you in terms of what the software number is okay.","Ravi Shankar - Morgan Stanley","Sure and then I just had a couple of quick follow-up. Kevin just to clarify what you said earlier on the call, when you have the new launches in the Powertrain business come in the second half of this year especially in the fourth quarter, you don't expect those new launches to be margin dilutive right?","Kevin P. Clark","No, we don't. We don't.","Ravi Shankar - Morgan Stanley","Okay and just lastly on the tax rate you obviously had an important development in the -- couple of months ago. Your press release kind of made it sound like you weren't sweating -- I don't know what was happening with the IRS. Can you just give us an update here and what kind of catalyst we shared or which are the points we should look out for?","Kevin P. Clark","Well listen what we feel is that we have a very good position. We feel very strongly about the nature and the structure of our transaction. We expect the appeals process to start at some point in time in 2015, hopefully early in 2015. It will take one to maybe two years, hopefully it\u2019s shorter versus longer in terms of how we are managing our business and our capital allocation strategy. That process has no impact on it. So we will continue operating as we operate today. Does that answer your second question?","Ravi Shankar - Morgan Stanley","Yes, yes that's very helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Hi, thank you very much. Good morning, I guess just there has been a lot kind of discussed on the margin trajectory but I guess tying things together sort of a first half, second half view, it does look like your -- kind of the incrementals that you have are accelerating in the second half implied by your guidance. That seems to dovetail with what's kind of been talked about here but I just wanted to make sure, we have kind of the right puts and takes. It sounds like you do have some of this restructuring that will help both ongoing and some of the new stuff from South America, you have the new launches in Powertrain and then potentially some mix tailwinds as well if I am not forgetting anything. So I just wanted to make sure, I was thinking about that correctly as we think about modeling the back half.","Kevin P. Clark","I think as you talk about flow-through, flow-through on incremental, incremental sales [downwards], second half versus first half you will see incremental flow-through most of that from a timing standpoint will be in Q4 versus in Q3 because Q3 just the natural, the natural summer shutdowns in North America and Europe affect operating productivity and performance. When you look at back half versus first half that certainly is the case, most of it will be weighted to Q4.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","And kind of that catalog of items there that I just cited are pretty much the right ones to be thinking about?","Kevin P. Clark","They are the right ones to be thinking about.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Terrific and then last one for me is just your commentary on M&A it's sounds like from what you said that, you had a few things that got close and that kind of fell apart at the altar, what -- why is that, is has just been, dispute on valuation have things become more difficult to close, given the run in some of these shares or were there other issues at hand and I guess how you are feeling about closing on your targeted levels of acquisitions now relative to maybe a quarter ago?","Kevin P. Clark","Once we got close on -- in reality it ultimately didn't end up being about value but ended up being about potential contingent liabilities that could come with the business, which I guess at the end it gets factored into value. But if you want risk of those liabilities versus the view that another buyer would potentially pay.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Got it and then how do you assess your ability to close some of these acquisitions now -- I mean that doesn't sound like a fundamental thing, that sounds actually quite stock -- company specific. So how are you assessing the environment now?","Kevin P. Clark","It\u2019s no different, again we are very active. We are looking at lot of opportunities, we have strategic and financial thresholds and metrics that we hold out there and use to evaluate opportunities. They need to meet those parameters. I think given where we are at this point in time of the year it's probably unlikely that we close a transaction this year. I think it's very possible we can announce something.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great that's very helpful color guys. Thank you very much.","Kevin P. Clark","Thank you Patrick.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Kevin P. Clark","Hi Joe.","Operator","Joe's line may have dropped. Joe if you could just re-queue by pressing star one. Joe is back. Your line is open.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital","Hi, can you hear me?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital","Hi sorry about that. So just two points of clarification one on the confidence on the powertrain business not being margin dilutive, is that a function of some of that business has already started up and it's just continuing to ramp a little bit more or is it really that this is some higher margin business or potentially mix related, that's not margin dilutive because if it is sort of new business, I would have thought that the incrementals were a little bit lower during the startup?","Rodney O\u2019Neal","Yeah, we have talk about this in the past, in reality we are always launching programs. We launch over a thousand programs a year. They tend to back half weighted, but you could argue we are in perpetual launch. You are right in terms of getting business ramped up, it tends to not be as profitable as business that you have been running on for period of time. But just given the puts and takes in our business it\u2019s not -- they are not programs we would call as margin dilutive. They are programs quite frankly that we did start launching in late in Q2 and we are continuing to see ramp up in volume. So there is partial benefit from that. But all of those, the launch which you call efficiencies are in the number that Kevin outlined, so it's\u2026","Joe Spak - RBC Capital","All right thanks, that's helpful. And then just thermal good to see some contraction there and sounds like a strong exit rate for the year. I guess just two questions related to that, should we -- it's seems like historically there was a bit of lumpiness in there. So is it -- should we see sequential improvement from here to the fourth quarter and then as we think about \u201815 is that exit rate a solid base to think about that business.","Kevin P. Clark","Yeah, I think just given again the summer shutdown pattern in North America and Europe I would expect margins in the thermal business to be flat to slightly down Q3 versus Q2 and then up significantly in Q4.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital","Okay and then in terms of\u2026","Kevin P. Clark","As you head into 2015, it's a business that will continue to have solid revenue growth and as the result solid margin expansion and flow through volume as well as operating execution.","Joe Spak - RBC Capital","Okay great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lim, Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ","David Lim - Wells Fargo Securities","Hi good morning everyone. Just wanted to ask a quick question about commercial vehicles both on and off road. Just wondering how did CV affect the quarter and where do you take going just to remind us, is CV revenue heavily related to Powertrain?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, CV revenue is heavily weighted towards Powertrain, our heavy duty diesel business.","David Lim - Wells Fargo Securities","And -- yes go ahead sorry.","Kevin P. Clark","Your question was -- is what was the impact on the quarter?","David Lim - Wells Fargo Securities","Yes, and going forward your thoughts there?","Kevin P. Clark","Sure, well the CV market, the market -- the production schedules, we ended up relative to where we expected it to be as we entered the quarter. The market was weaker, principally in Europe, Asia was a bit weak as well as South America. We saw high single digit growth in our heavy duty diesel business and even in light of that so we see a continued ramp up of revenue in that product category. We expect it to continue during the balance of the year. A part of it is launch of the new program that we touched on, part which is driving growth within our Powertrain product portfolio. But for the full year we would expect the CV market to be not quite as strong as we expected it to be three or four months ago, growing but not growing at the rate we originally estimated or the industry originally estimated.","David Lim - Wells Fargo Securities","And any preliminary views on 2015 related to the commercial view?","Kevin P. Clark","Not at this point in time.","David Lim - Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you very much.","Rodney O\u2019Neal","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA. Your line is open.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","Hi good morning everybody.","Kevin P. Clark","Good morning.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","Wanted to ask you, a question about your outlook for the ability to keep outgrowing the market growth. Obviously this quarter we saw maybe a couple of points of outperformance versus your geographically adjusted production, seems like you are gaining through sort of say maybe two- three points for this coming quarter. Yet at the same time when you look at $800 million backlog that would have been probably like more maybe five points of outperformance, but more importantly looking mid-term we could -- the backlog numbers we\u2019ve given would probably translate into six, seven points. So I am just curious are we going to start seeing an inflection point later in the year, so let's say maybe fourth quarter this year where things are going to start picking up meaningfully in terms of your ability to outgrow the market.","Kevin P. Clark","Yeah, I think what you will see in Q3 principally in Q4 is growth relative to market increasing in comparison to where we were in first half of this year. So you will see a continued acceleration in that growth relative to market.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","And that's principally a function of the timing of the launches of the new business.","Kevin P. Clark","Timing of new programs, customer mix, it\u2019s a few items, but principally timing and new programs.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","Okay. And then one final one for me M&A you\u2019ve obviously given lot of good color. One of your earlier prepared remarks was saying that the environment has improved. Can you maybe tell us sort of in what way, is it just in terms of number of opportunities you are being presented with or do you generally feel like there is something else out there that's getting better.","Rodney O\u2019Neal","No, we would say it's opportunities. There are more opportunities that are being presented. Sellers are more willing or potential sellers are more willing to have discussions about separating some assets.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA","Understood, thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS, your line is open.","Colin Langan - UBS","Great, thanks for taking my question. Any color on the pace of the purchases you mentioned you think it's likely may -- you probably won\u2019t close a deal but may announce something, I mean that does give a lot of timing, should we think purchase should pick up in the second half them if you are not going to be closing on a deal.","Kevin P. Clark","Yeah, Kevin, that's a good question. We bought $220 million in Q2, I would expect without closing on a transaction for that pace to increase slightly maybe be run at a rate of $250 million a quarter, assuming we are not going to close on a transaction this year or early next year.","Colin Langan - UBS","Okay and then looking at the Powertrain margins were down year-over-year. I am not sure, if I missed this in your comments but was that partly reflecting the commercial and legal settlement last year or was that the segment where that was a help last year? ","Kevin P. Clark","Yea, there is a little, that was about $5 million. So there is a little bit of that and then the other piece is just you know, net-net flat sales.","Colin Langan - UBS","Okay, and just lastly just the kind of, your organic growth is only 3% this quarter, isn't too far from global production. Can you just remind what are the reasons why you had this, you not outperforming the way you would normally and what are the main factors and really, more importantly when those maybe [side] going forward?","Kevin P. Clark","Well organic growth was 3.5% of weighted markets, so it\u2019s about 1.6%. So we grew above markets and yes if want to look at global vehicle production and assume we are on -- our mix matches global vehicle production you could have a different view but that will vary each and every quarter. The big headwind to growth rate, quite frankly this year has been the aftermarket business for us. That's been a significant headwind. South America clearly has been a market that's been challenged and our revenues been challenged there. But in our view relative to revenue growth we are in line with exactly where we told people we would be at this point of the year and you will see it continue to accelerate in the back half of the year.","Colin Langan - UBS","Okay, all right thank you very much.","Operator","We have no further questions on the line. I would like to turn our call back over to Jessica Holscott.","Jessica L. Holscott","Great. Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. As always, we\u2019ll be available for any additional questions you may have after the call today. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes Delphi second quarter 2014 earnings conference call.

My name is Kalia, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Delphi Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute on prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Jessica L. Holscott, Delphi Vice President of Investor Relations. Jessica, you may now begin your conference.","Jessica L. Holscott - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Kalia. And thanks for joining Delphi's Second Quarter Earnings Call. To follow along with today's presentation our slides can be found at delphi.com, under the Investors section of the website.","Please see slide two for a disclosure on forward-looking statements which we will be making on today's call, and only reflect Delphi's current view of future financial performance which may be materially different from our actual performance.","In addition, today's call will include disclosure of a transaction that is governed by the U.K. Takeover Code. As such, Delphi is limited as to the information that it can disclose on that transaction. Thank you for your understanding.","Joining us today will be Kevin Clark, Delphi's CEO and President; Jeff Owens, our Chief Technology Officer; and Mark Murphy, our CFO.","As seen on slide three, Kevin will provide an operations update, as well as an overview of the quarter, and then Mark will cover the financial results and 2015 outlook in more detail. We'll then pass it back to Kevin and Jeff, who will cover some of our recent portfolio changes.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thank you, Jessica. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.","Before Mark gets into our financial results, I'd like to provide some context around our record second quarter. Beginning with the macro environment on slide five, vehicle production in North America remained solid and in line with our prior outlook. Europe is trending higher since our last earnings call. As widely reported, China market growth has slowed and is reflected in our current outlook for vehicle production growth. However, we remain bullish regarding the China market and expect to continue to outpace growth in this market by 8 points to 10 points, with our high technology portfolio of GDi, Active Safety, and Infotainment products that are aligned with the trend toward increased vehicle content. Lastly, the South American market continues to weaken.","Taking a step back, solid growth in North America and an improving outlook for Europe, is expected to offset a portion of the softening market in China and continued weakness in South America. Other macro factors, principally lower raw material prices, are helping to counter a portion of the negative translation effect of the stronger dollar.","Moving to our second quarter highlights on slide six, we delivered very strong financial results. Revenue growth was more than four points over market, operating income totaled a record $526 million, and operating margins expanded 80 basis points to 13.6%, reflecting EBITDA margins of 17%.","During the quarter, we completed several portfolio actions, including the sale of our Thermal business, strategic investments in tool and technology and Quanergy Systems, and agreements to acquire Ottomatika and sell our Reception Systems product line. In addition to these actions, we just announced an agreement to acquire HellermannTyton. We'll touch on each of these portfolio moves in greater detail a little later.","Now with the second quarter complete, we're confident in our full year outlook: 7% revenue growth, roughly 6 points over market, operating margins reaching 13% and free cash flow of roughly $1.1 billion, providing us with tremendous flexibility to increase shareholder value.","Slide seven covers new business bookings which came in at $5 billion during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $15 billion. That's $4 billion more than last year, putting us solidly on a path to exceed our prior-year bookings amount. Major bookings include conquest wins with Volvo in Asia for Electrical Architecture, Fiat Chrysler in North America for Infotainment, Great Wall in China for GDi and a BMW award in Europe for Active Safety.","The right side of the chart reflects the geographic mix of our year-to-date bookings. A few larger awards in North America skewed the regional mix, but we expect future bookings will continue to reflect a more balanced regional distribution of revenues.","Now in addition to winning new business, customers continue to recognize Delphi for our technology and execution. Slide eight includes a list of customers that Delphi recently received awards from. Notably earlier this month we received the VW Group award in the category of Global Champion for our new generation Infotainment systems. With this system, Delphi and VW are among the first to bring both CarPlay and Android Auto to mass market vehicles. These awards are validation that Delphi is delivering leading-edge technology solutions with flawless operational execution.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark for a more detailed look at our second quarter financial results and then Jeff Owens and I will talk about the strategic investments we've announced which will help drive our future results. Mark?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with prior calls, today's review of our actual and forecasted financials exclude restructuring and special items. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP is included in the back of this presentation and the press release. As Kevin mentioned, the sale of the wholly owned portion of our Thermal business closed in the quarter for which we received $660 million in proceeds and booked an after-tax gain of $285 million in discontinued operations. With the Thermal business reclassified for all periods presented and reflected as discontinued operations, my review will address the continuing operations at Delphi.","Slide 10 provides a snapshot of our second quarter financial performance. Reported revenue totaled $3.9 billion, up 4% on an adjusted basis which is four points over market. Second quarter operating income increased to $526 million, the highest ever reported by Delphi. Operating margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to a record 13.6%. Earnings per share were $1.34, up approximately 11% excluding the effects of currency and commodities. Adjusting for year-over-year tax differences, EPS growth would have been approximately 16%. During the quarter we returned $385 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Slide 11 provides greater detail on revenue. Revenue of $3.9 billion reflects $378 million of year-over-year currency and commodity headwinds, partially offset by strong underlying growth. In Europe, adjusted revenue increased 4% or three points over market. Growth in Europe was driven by strong Powertrain volume growth and new program launches in Electrical Architecture. With program launches across all segments, we project Europe growth to accelerate in the second half. North America adjusted revenue increased roughly 5% or two points over market, primarily driven by our Powertrain and Electrical Architecture businesses.","Growth in China was 8% or eight points over market and driven by gas direct injection, Infotainment and Active Safety launches. South America performed better than market but was still down on continued underlying market weakness.","Slide 12 walks the year-over-year change in operating income to a record $526 million, up 11% excluding currency and commodity effects. Operating margins expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to 13.6%, primarily due to volume leverage and continued productivity gains.","Slide 13 covers our segments. On an adjusted basis, Electrical Architecture's revenue increased 4% or 4 points over market with growth in North America, Europe, and Asia. Powertrain gas and diesel program launches drove growth of 7% or seven points over market with especially strong growth in North America and China.","Electronics and Safety revenue increased 2%. With product launches in Active Safety and Infotainment, we expect Electronics and Safety growth to accelerate in the second half. On operating margins, Electrical Architecture expanded margins 70 basis points to a record 14.3% on continued growth and operating excellence. Powertrain margins increased 120 basis points on strong growth in operating performance. Electronics and Safety expanded margins 70 basis points due principally to operating performance.","Turning to slide 14, operating income growth and share repurchases largely offset year-over-year tax effects. EPS growth was approximately 16% excluding currency and commodity effects and tax differences.","Turning to our outlook, slide 15 provides our full-year guidance assumptions. We expect global vehicle production growth of 1% to 2%, reflecting continued solid growth in North America, stronger Europe volumes and slower China growth. In China, we're forecasting growth of 4% for the year with growth rates returning to approximately 6% in the fourth quarter. Our guidance maintains $1.10 Euro rate.","Our third quarter and full-year guidance is on slide 16. We are reducing our full-year revenue outlook $100 million on $100 million lower revenues in China due to changes in customer production schedules and approximately $50 million, primarily associated with the divestment of our Reception Systems business, which is largely offset by higher Europe volumes. For the year, we expect revenues of $15.2 billion to $15.6 billion, a 7% adjusted growth rate and 6 points over market.","OI is projected to be in the range of $1.98 billion to $2.03 billion. Our EPS estimate is $5.30 to $5.40 with a projected tax rate of 16%. For the third quarter, we expect revenues of $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion, a 9% adjusted growth rate or 5 points over market. We expect OI to be in range of $460 million to $480 million and EPS of $1.25 to $1.35.","In summary, it was a strong first half of the year with record operating results in the face of significant currency headwinds. In the second half, we project growth to accelerate across all segments and consolidated year-over-year margin expansion to continue.","At this time I'll turn it back over to Kevin to talk about our recent investments.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Mark.","Now I'd like to shift the discussion to our portfolio actions, each of which is in line with our capital allocation strategy, as outlined on slide 18. We intend to maintain our investment grade ratings through the cycle. We're going to do this while deploying capital to fund investments and acquisitions and share repurchases, all of which will drive shareholder value. Our focus continues to be on investments and acquisitions that strengthen our competitive position, have strong management teams and solid operating systems, and have strong financial metrics.","So we'll now turn it over to Jeff, to briefly talk about a few of our recent investments.","Jeffrey J. Owens - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP","Okay. Thanks, Kevin.","Slide 19 shows our history of delivering value-enhancing transactions. So in addition to the HellermannTyton transaction Kevin will speak to in a minute, most recently, we've completed investments in two technology companies, divested of our Reception Systems business, closed down the Thermal divestiture and acquired Ottomatika, the advanced automated driving software company we announced an investment in last year.","In an effort to continuously expand Delphi's technology capabilities, we've made strategic investments in the three companies noted on slide 20. Tula Technology is a provider of engine-control algorithms and software for cylinder deactivation. By combining Delphi and Tula's engine-control systems software, we can increase fuel efficiency and cut emissions without sacrificing drivability or performance.","Cylinder deactivation has been used by automakers for some time to meet ever-increasing regulatory demands for increasing fuel economy. It has always been accomplished by shutting down a bank of cylinders, a 6-cylinder running on 3-cylinders, for example. Tula's Dynamic Skip Fire software allows the engine to run on however many cylinders you need at the time. 6-cylinders can run on five or three or two, whatever, and it's invisible to the consumer and increases fuel efficiency by up to 15%.","In addition to Tula, Delphi has entered into a strategic partnership with Quanergy Systems, strengthening its ADAS and automated driving applications. Quanergy and Delphi will collaborate to bring a range of lost-cost, high-performance, solid-state LiDAR products to the automotive market that will provide an affordable and high volume vehicle perception solution for level three and four automated applications. The prospect of a lower-cost ADAS solution could bring wider-spread adoption of the life-saving Active Safety technology.","Delphi has also completed the acquisition of Ottomatika, a spinoff of Carnegie Mellon University and the leading provider of decision-network software for automated vehicles. Previously, Delphi had completed a strategic investment in Ottomatika and the parties had entered into a joint development agreement. By combining Ottomatika's automated driving software with Delphi's Active Safety systems, the two companies delivered a technology platform for Delphi's automated driving test vehicles that enables a vehicle to make human-like decisions.","This work resulted in several successful automated driving demonstrations including the longest automated cross-country drive in North America earlier this year. The acquisition will enable Delphi to create an advanced Driver Assistance Systems Engineering Center of Excellence in Pittsburgh and further cooperate with the Carnegie-Mellon University in developing next generation automated solutions and sensor fusion for intelligent driving.","Ottomatika and Quanergy both complement and enhance Delphi's technology capabilities and allow us to further accelerate work on automated driving as we take our software development to the next level. And Tula's proprietary engine control software could be a game changer, enabling Delphi's cylinder deactivation technology which is already providing significant fuel savings to be more efficient and clean. You can expect us to continue to seek technology rich investment opportunities such as these and enhance our existing portfolio.","Moving to slide 21. The Electrical Architecture segment is particularly important because as vehicle complexity increases, Electrical Architectures grow in content. So for example from now through 2020 we expect that wiring and cable will increase by almost 70% in length, up to two and a half miles. The connectors will grow by more than 25%. Cable management systems will grow along with the growth of both cable and connectors. Digital data will increase significantly up to 1.5 gigabit per second. And voltage will increase from 12 volts a day up to 600 volts. This complexity growth leads OEMs to rely on Electrical Architecture experts such as Delphi for system optimization solutions. With consumers now demanding more connectivity in their vehicles Electrical Architecture is the foundation for that vehicle content growth. For Delphi, it's the perfect storm of more content driving greater revenue growth.","Now I would like to turn it back to Kevin to talk about a transaction that fits perfectly in this space.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Jeff. Let's move to slide 22. As Jeff said, the acquisition of HellermannTyton positions us to benefit from the increased demand for electrical architecture solutions. As one of HellermannTyton's largest customers we know the company very well. HellermannTyton is a leading global manufacturer of highly engineered cable management solutions. They have a very strong management team with a track record of delivering strong revenue and earnings growth.","The transaction is valued at $1.85 billion, reflecting a multiple of 2015 EBITDA plus run-rate synergies which is below Delphi's current EBITDA multiple. The transaction will be funded with the $660 million of proceeds from the Thermal sale that Mark referenced earlier, as well as debt. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter and will be accretive to revenue growth and to margins. We currently estimate the transaction will be $0.15 accretive to 2016 earnings per share. On a whole synergy adjusted run rate basis, the transaction is actually roughly $0.26 accretive to 2016 EPS.","Slide 23 provides an overview of HellermannTyton. 2016 sales are expected to increase over 10% to \u20ac679 million. EBITDA margins have historically been just under 20%. Roughly half of HellermannTyton revenues are from Automotive, a segment which has been growing at a compound rate of 17% since 2010. The balance of the company's revenues are generated in the Electrical and Datacom markets and as you can see HellermannTyton has a relatively balanced mix of regional revenues the result of its very strong worldwide brand.","As you can see on slide 24, HellermannTyton checks the box on each of the acquisition guidelines we've consistently articulated. The transaction meets our core strategic objectives and operating guidelines and enhances our financial metrics, which translates into increased shareholder value.","Slide 25 outlines the key areas of synergies. The bulk of our $50 million of synergy savings will be generated through sourcing and supply chain savings and the elimination of some public company costs. We also expect to generate revenue synergies over the longer term by leveraging the combined product portfolio in the automotive and industrial markets.","As summarized on slide 26, we believe the acquisition of HellermannTyton will create significant shareholder value. The transaction further strengthens Delphi's leadership position in the Electrical Architecture market. It accelerates our revenue and earnings growth, generates significant operating synergies and is accretive to earnings per share. We have a track record of increasing shareholder value through smart M&A, as an example (20:53) MVL is an acquisition that we completed a little over two years ago significantly strengthened our position in the Connector market. In addition the transaction ultimately generated synergies which were $30 million over our original plans, and we currently have EBITDA margins in that business that are 200 basis points higher than our acquisition model. We're confident that we will execute on this transaction just as well.","Wrapping up on slide 27, we had a record quarter marked by solid operating performance which we translated into strong revenue and earnings growth giving us a high level of confidence in our revenue and earnings outlook for the balance of the year.","In addition, we made significant progress realigning our product portfolio, allowing us to increase our focus on our high-growth and high-margin technologies in the Safe, Green, Connected Markets segments.","So with that, I'll turn it back to the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning, Rod.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Congratulations on the quarter and the acquisitions.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thank you.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Couple of questions. One, I was hoping you might give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing in China, relative to a couple things. Any changes in customer business mix? Maybe remind us how your backlog is coming in? And how much of the backlog is coming in from China? And whether there's any changes there? And what would the sensitivity be at this point for every 1% change in China production?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sure. Sure. I have all the good questions. So China market is \u2013 beginning with the first portion of your question in terms of overall outlook, we started to see weakness, significant weakness in the China market actually beginning in late June. That's when we saw a reduction in overall production schedule which, quite frankly, has continued into July. Our outlook for the China market for Q3 is I think up 3% on a year-over-year basis.","July production is going to be weak, we saw pulling the schedules in early July. It appears to have stabilized somewhat as we look at August and September. We are beginning to see some OEs actually add schedules to the fourth quarter. It's probably a little too early at this point in time to reflect those in our overall numbers, but it appears as though we're starting to see an uplift in the fourth quarter.","When you look at mix of our revenues, a little over 70% of our revenues are with the multinationals. A little under 30% are with the locals. Clearly over the last, let's call it, couple quarters, the locals have been picking up on some market share related to SUVs. Our general view is that will stabilize over the next, beginning next year. As we look at China over the 2016 and beyond, we think it's a market that returns to, call it 6% year-over-year vehicle production growth. We- this year as well as into the outer years, we expect to continue to grow at 8 plus points over market, Rod, just given our mix of customers as well as given where we sit from a product portfolio standpoint and the growth in content, whether it's with the multi-nationals or with the locals.","When you look at bookings. Over the last couple of years, China has accounted for between 22% and 25% of our total new business bookings. If I were to calibrate each 1% reduction in vehicle production for China, that translates to about $30 million of revenue and roughly $7 million or $8 million of operating income.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks, and there's two other things. One is obviously you're expecting some acceleration in the organic growth in the back half to get to the 7%. Could you give us some color on which divisions will be driving that? And lastly, congratulations on these Active Safety awards. Could you maybe talk a little bit about how things are progressing there? What kind of content per vehicle are you seeing? Are any of these expanding into increased autonomy at this point, or are they primarily forward-crash avoidance systems?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Why don't I \u2013 I'll start with the latter question and then Jeff can talk about technology and where it's headed and some of our customer discussions and then Mark can come back to where we're going to see revenue growth in the back half of the year.","When you look at Active Safety, and we think Active Safety to autonomous driving, that's a very broad spectrum that as we've discussed before is all highly dependent upon the technologies that deliver Active Safety nearer term. On our Q1 earnings call, we talked about Active Safety revenues growing roughly 50% on a year-over-year basis. Our outlook now is Active Safety, as we look at Q2, Q3, and Q4 is going to be growing north of 60% for Delphi. So we're seeing tremendous increased take rate as well as tremendous demand for Active Safety solutions from our customers.","Maybe I'll turn it over to Jeff to talk about some of the technology and our customer discussions and then we can go to Mark on the revenue.","Jeffrey J. Owens - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP","Yeah, so Rod this is Jeff. And certainly the business continues to grow a great deal in the forward component of Active Safety, the radar and the vision systems. But also now we're seeing a significant growth in the medium and short-range radar products as well. And in terms of higher levels of automation you're going to continue to see chunks of the use cases go to automated. So as we have a few vehicles on the road today, you're going to have more vehicles that have the capability of driving at highway speed with hands off the wheel if you will, lane vectoring to keep you in the lane, and then collision imminent technology to prevent a collision going forward. So there'll be periods of the drive that, or the use case that will be automated but still it's mostly the collision avoidance aspect of technology that's being implemented right now.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Mark, you want to talk a little bit about...","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So Rod, yeah you're correct. We go from basically mid-single-digit growth in the first half or 4% over market to high single-digits in the second half, about 7% over market. On a segment basis we're seeing strong sequential growth in all segments especially E&S. E&S will go from basically flat with market in the first half up to over 6% over market in the second half.","And then on EEA and Powertrain, both those will grow from mid to high single digits sequentially. On a regional basis, North America growth will maintain its strength through the back half of the year, sustaining about 3% over market. And then in Asia Pacific that remains about 10% over market through the second half. And then in Europe we're going to see with the launch of some diesel programs, Infotainment business, Active Safety business, and also some wiring business, the wire harness business is coming online, see very strong growth sequentially first to second half from a little bit over market in the first half to high single digits in the second half over market.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning, John. John?","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you hear me guys?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah we hear you now.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. If we look at slide 23, one of the big things in this HellermannTyton acquisition is business outside of the automotive industry. And I think one thing that we've always looked at, and I think you guys have looked at is the potential for your Connector business outside of auto \u2013 the auto industry. So I was just wondering as you think about this, you're talking about a lot of cost synergies here, but really trying to understand with the revenue synergies might be? I mean I know you alluded to these, but I would imagine Majdi wants to push these pretty hard on the Connector side. Just curious what the opportunity is there?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Listen, we think the opportunity is really big. Today, our Connector business is, I don't know, roughly $300 million out of the total $2.5 billion-plus, outside of automotive OE in Tier 1. And we think the capabilities of HellermannTyton, the strength of their sales organization really provides tremendous opportunity to sell more connectors to that network into that market.","On the flip side, I mean given the strength that we have in the automotive space and with our Tier 1 partners in the Electrical Architecture area is we think there's more that we can do in terms of partnering to sell their products into customers where we have really strong relationships.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then also...","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","We \u2013 to underscore, John, we think it's really big and we think, given the margin structure of this business or the combined business, that the profit impact is significant.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then also as we think about these acquisitions, I mean obviously there's a tremendous amount of technology here. The geographic diversity is not too far off what you have right now. What is the customer set in the automaker base? Is there any expansion into, maybe the Koreans and the Japanese that might help as far as customer diversification?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","They have a very strong position in the Japanese market, both from an industrial market standpoint, as well as from an OE standpoint. 10% of their total revenues are in Japan. That's significantly greater than what we have today. We think that's \u2013 that is a real opportunity for Delphi, and there are other examples.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just lastly, maybe if we think about everything that's going on in the world and there's great concerns about a slowdown in China and whether North America is peaking and what ultimately will happen in Europe, could you just remind us, as we think about your cost structure, what kind of variability you have in your cost structure? And what kind of ability you have to react to potential downturns, even though we're not expecting them, but potential downturns in markets to mitigate any downside risk that may occur in the years to come?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Listen, I'll comment, and then Mark should follow up. Listen, 75% of our cost structure is variable. Over 25% of our hourly workforce is contract so we have a tremendous amount of flexibility to flux in the event we need to, to respond to lower volume or other matters. Mark underscored the point. When you look at it, this year on a year-over-year basis when you take into account changes in, for example, things like foreign exchange as well as a continued weak South America market and China, we're delivering tremendous margin expansion, absolutely tremendous margin expansion and flow through when you adjust for FX that's, I think north of 30%. So we have a business model where we're very focused on maintaining flexibility so to the extent there's any sort of hiccups in the macro-economy we can deal with them. Mark?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would just add, John, that at the same time we're accelerating our growth to above market, we're also experiencing a year where we're delivering record productivity internally, so it's that capability to drive productivity that's going to become especially helpful in the event of any sort of slowdown so we can react very quickly.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much and congrats on all the progress.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli of Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, thanks and good morning, everyone, and congrats.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning, Itay.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Just maybe for Mark, I think you alluded to some of the revenue guidance changes from China, Europe being good news, and then the divestiture. Do you also have that for the operating income impact tucked in your guidance?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I'm taking a step back. The way \u2013 here's how I would call it, you can chime in. So China is worth about $100 million of revenue and when you look at decremental margins of about $30 million in OI. The Reception Systems business we lose $50 million of revenue in the back half of the year and roughly $20 million of OI. Now the flow through on that is high because it's a business that quite frankly was shrinking and we weren't allocating for spending engineering dollars. And then worth roughly a $50 million pickup in the back half of the year at 15% OI flow-through which is about 30%, so net-net you lose about $100 million in revenue and $25 million of OI.","In addition to that we have the flexible cost structure that Mark and I just talked about, but given the demand we're seeing for Active Safety, given the transactions, quantity and Ottomatika that we've talked about we're really focused on, we're going to be ramping up invests and engineering in and around the Active Safety and automated driving space to continue to drive increased revenue growth and to execute on a number of the opportunities, the increased set of opportunities that we see out there today.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. And then maybe on Active Safety. Just two follow-up questions. First, could you talk a bit about where Quanergy is in terms of the development process? How far are we potentially from the production awards and so what the pipeline there is. And also did you mention that you had an Active Safety win with BMW? And if so could you talk a little bit more about that in terms of is that rate cam or is that some kind of other functionality?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Jeff, you want to go ahead?","Jeffrey J. Owens - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP","Yes. Itay, hi. It's Jeff. So if you think about Quanergy in solid-state LiDAR. It's still very much in the development phase. So I would expect that we're going to see development contracts with multiple OEs as we work together with them to bring us into automotive grade capability. But it's still going to be development contracts, not production contracts for a period of time. The real value that we see in this investment for us is to get on a glide slope where you can bring this down to put a LiDAR on the four corners of the vehicle and keep it under $1000, maybe even get down in the $500 to $600 range for four different systems and at that, now you're going to see application with the automated driving strategies for the OEs around the world. But it still has to be proven. It still has to work with their individual architectures so therefore it's going to be development contracts only here for a couple years.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Terrific. And then you quoted a BMW award for Active Safety Jeff is that?","Jeffrey J. Owens - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. So the BMW award is for medium and short-range radar. Again one of the components that gets enabled by the five star rating of the Euro NCAP in a product segment that we think is going to greatly accelerate in the United States as soon as the United States passes that sticker law or puts Active Safety into five star as well. So it's a 76 GHz base radar product. So it's of our forward-looking radar expertise if you will but in a medium and short range implementation.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Very helpful, Jeff. And then just quick housekeeping. Is there a share account assumption for the second half of the year or at least the full year guidance?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah Itay. We're assuming in the second half we continue on buyback pace that we had in the first.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Perfect. That's very helpful. Thanks so much everyone and congrats again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks good morning everyone. Well done on snagging Ottomatika. We've had a very good impression of the team there. Can you give us a little more color on how Ottomatika will work within Delphi? Because I think they had some existing relationships with other OEMs and maybe some non-traditional OEMs as well. So can you talk about whether that will be run as an independent entity or whether that'll be blended within Delphi?","Jeffrey J. Owens - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP","Yeah, Ravi, it's Jeff. So we intend to keep this group separate and located in Pittsburgh, adjacent to Carnegie Mellon University for a couple of reasons. One so we can keep them separate so they can keep doing the great things that they're doing and two, to access the tremendous amount of intellectual capital coming out of Carnegie Mellon. We would expect that the relationships they currently have with OEs will continue and we'll continue to nurture those and the reason for it is because they've got market-leading algorithms here. They really have more experience, and in our view, the best in the world at being able to think about automated driving scenarios at a vehicle level and that will help bring that into automotive grade. We'll combine our efforts together, but we do intend to keep them as a separate group.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right, and I was also pretty interested to see that you had relationships now with both Ottomatika and Quanergy, one being software algorithms and one being hardware. It really showed that, or maybe I'm missing this, are you kind of going with a holistic approach to autonomous driving where you are not just a systems integrator, but you are providing both the hardware and the software and so you can get to a point where you can make maybe your own stand-alone autonomous driving system that can be put into an OEMs car, or how are you thinking about that approach?","Jeffrey J. Owens - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP","Yeah, that's a big question. We certainly want to have the portfolio where we can operate at the vehicle level and operate at the component level, and that's going to include hardware and a lot of software, no doubt. But even Quanergy, even though the big development there is going to be a solid-state LiDAR as opposed to a mechanical scan, even there you're going to have some significant software and algorithm work to be able to work behind that solid-state optical system to be able to do scenario analysis and discrimination, object discrimination, just like you do with radar, just like you do with vision. So I don't know that we'll ever have just a hardware world anymore. There's always going to be a software component behind it, but fortunately Quanergy is quite good at both and with our capability we'll be able to augment that into automotive grade.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And Ravi, I think it important \u2013 we probably should say in addition to the investments that we've made to date, we're really focused on pursuing other opportunities, whether investments or acquisitions in vehicle data acquisition and management systems, short-range radar solutions that enhance our existing portfolio, configurable touch screens, connected vehicle services and telematics, data security solutions, things like that. So there are technologies that are not specifically in automated driving or Active Safety that we're evaluating as well.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I understand that, and just related to that, can you give us more color on this FCA Infotainment win? I mean it sounds like a really big program and I think you mentioned that in the last quarter. But can you talk about the systems that you have? What sizes, what range, what kind of products? Also are you now the sole source Infotainment supplier to FCA?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","We're not the sole source Infotainment supplier. We have a very significant portion of their business. This is a follow-on award to an award that we actually received, I don't know a couple of years ago actually. The specific definition or requirements around the program, Ravi I don't have them at my fingertips. I can certainly provide you with that information if you'd like it.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question from the line of David Leiker of Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning everyone.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning David.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Just follow up on a couple of items from Ravi here. If we look at Active Safety and automated drive and you seem to be going down the road in some fashion here of vertical integration and I was going to ask where else would you go with that? You had mentioned touchscreens, telematics but anywhere else on the basic components within that system?","Jeffrey J. Owens - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. I think, David its Jeff. Multi domain controllers will be a big part of this architecture that operates at a system level and certainly cybersecurity. The ability to make sure that the information is secure in and out of the vehicle and on the vehicle for mission-critical implementations. So those would be two key areas off the top of my mind that we'll be highly interested in.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then a question for Mark on the, I guess its slide 12. You show currency and commodities as a net number. Could you give us the gross numbers for that?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Give us one second to get to the slide.","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, David it's, just give me one second here. It's primarily, it's almost all a currency number. There's a small single digit that's at commodity, and then actually in the quarter.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then one last item here on Hellermann. The non-automotive piece of that business is that something you intend to keep? Is that something you build? Is that something you might look to divest?","Jeffrey J. Owens - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP","No, it's definitely something we keep. It's a great business. They have a great market position. As I mentioned, we do $300 million of connector business outside of our automotive OE tier 1 business. It's a space where we would like to do more. It's clearly a different business and a different business model. It's short cycle, but it's a very attractive business and they have an excellent position in that market and we'd like to leverage that.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. I have two questions. One is shorter term, one mid-term. The shorter term one is what's driving the margin within Powertrain just in Q2 and for the remainder of the year? And are there product lines within that that are particularly more profitable that you're seeing a mix shift towards? Is it just general kind of combination of cost reduction and margin? And kind of related to that how are your OEMs thinking about the impact of low oil prices and what kind of Powertrain equipment they, the timing of really Powertrain upgrades as opposed to whether they need them or not for 2020?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Mark, you want to talk about what's driving margin expansion?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Brian it's primarily a volume driven effect but there's also strong productivity as well. I'd say roughly two thirds of volume related effects.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And it's commercial or just broadly?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So Brian as you recall we've done a lot of rotation of our Western European footprint over the last couple of years including in that business. And just to qualitatively underscore Mark's point, the reality is we're getting the benefit of growth under that lower cost structure. I think when you look at from a product mix standpoint there wouldn't really be a product mix benefit diesel versus gas or Variable Valvetrain. So it's really performance and cost structure.","Your question about what we're hearing from the OEMs and their focus on reducing CO2 emissions and fuel efficiency and Jeff and I were over in Europe a week ago in meetings. Clearly the focus remains on meeting standards. I know there's dialogue among some of the OEs with respect to a desire to push that back and conversations with, at least at the U.S. level, requests to push back. We'll tell you, in Europe we see very little possibility that the European regulators and governments would reduce CO2 emissions in the timetable for improvement. And based on our discussions and what we're hearing in Washington we think it's highly unlikely that the government here backs off the current standards and the timing related to those current standards. That's what we're being told now.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And kind of mid term question is rather than drilling into the three things you bought, I want to kind of talk about cybersecurity, what you're hearing from customers. And then what you have right now and what you may be thinking of having to provide solutions around cybersecurity.","Jeffrey J. Owens - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. Brian, its Jeff. So certainly, it's a hot topic. There's no doubt about it, and cybersecurity will continue to be a topic probably for the rest of our careers. Just by the nature of where the technology goes on vehicles, the amount of software in the pipes continue to get bigger and bigger. Right now there's really not a systemic issue in the industry and we're all working to make sure that it stays that way. So we use authentication techniques today, encryption, gateways, firewalls. I mean that's part of architectures, that's part of our individual product designs. But at the same time, we're looking to make the designs even more robust at the component level or at the system level.","The OEs are looking at the vehicle level with cybersecurity software nuggets, or kernels for example that we would embed into the individual products or on the serial data bus. So I guess stay tuned for that. I think we're going to see more of that happening over the next couple of years, just to make the architectures more robust than they are today and like I said, particularly as the pipes get bigger, making sure that information coming in and out of the pipes. The 4G LTE, for example, that's secure in both ways. Secure coming in and secure going out. The technology is available to do that. It's a matter of making sure that it's implemented properly.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And is that something that you'd either A, develop internally, B, partner with a small software company to do? Or C, join the list of things you've purchased over the last few weeks in the future?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I think all three of those will be our plan of attack, Brian.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lim of Wells Fargo Securities.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning, David.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I just wanted to follow up on that BMW Active Safety. Is that for forward collision or AEB? Can you give us a little bit more color on that if you would?","Jeffrey J. Owens - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. So it's a medium and short-range radar so it's for a stop and go or a low speed collision-imminent braking, and also including pedestrian kinds of interactions. So does that make sense?","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. So this is going to be a radar over a vision-based system, is that correct?","Jeffrey J. Owens - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP","It's going to be radar used in conjunction with a vision-based system.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Got you. And then I had a question on the China Infotainment and Active Safety. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what are you exactly providing and if you could disclose who you're providing to on the China Infotainment and Active Safety front?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, listen David. As you can imagine, our customers, without their prior approval are very sensitive to sharing that sort of information. So we can't provide customer names. We can tell you they're relatively mid level to higher-level Infotainment systems, on the Active Safety side, mid level Active Safety.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And is that, I mean can you provide is it a global OEM or is it more of an indigenous Chinese OEM? Is that a level of detail that you can provide?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. It's both.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Both. Okay. Got you. And then I wanted to sort of piggyback on Brian Johnson's question on Cybersecurity. Obviously there was that article in Wired but Jeff, I was wondering could you maybe talk about the evolution of the CAN bus system? Is there something that is more robust that is being designed or is that going to be adequate enough to provide a level of safety that OEMs are looking for?","Jeffrey J. Owens - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP","Yeah that's, we could talk quite a while on that. The evolution of the CAN bus has been always with a cybersecurity factor in mind. Probably not near on par with the kind of attacks that are possible today but it all depends on how you interact with the CAN bus so you can, the CAN bus in and of itself isn't necessarily an issue. It's what gets on the CAN bus and what gets off. And you can control that at the component level or at the systems level. So a lot of different approaches here to take it at the CAN bus to take it at the component, to take it at the system, and then to look for overlays like AutoStar or Jasper for example or the functional safety the 26262 requirements that are becoming indigenous for safety critical products in the cars around the world. So a lot of different approaches here. Fairly well coordinated but the industry is still going to be working to make progress in this space.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And one last question I had on Hellermann. Is the industrial portion, the margins on the industrial side, is that better than the automotive margin? Thank you.","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","They're relatively consistent and in-line.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak of RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. One more follow-up on Hellermann. I didn't really hear anything about their footprint or cost structure. I mean the margins seem pretty healthy but I was wondering if there was any opportunity there and then I guess somewhat related if there's what the CapEx profile for that business looks like if it's similar to Delphi?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. I think ultimately, I'll start with the CapEx profile. I think ultimately it ends up similar with profile with Delphi. If you look at the last few years they've been investing significantly in capacity and capabilities in the automotive space. So to put it in perspective, if you go back to 2010, roughly 38%, 39% of revenues were in automotive, today its north of 50%. And to grow at that pace we've had to invest in capacity. So the last couple years CapEx has been higher than what Delphi's typical average is, but we believe that will come down.","If you look at footprints they have 12 facilities across the globe in 10 countries and major markets. Those facilities are highly automated, it's a highly engineered product, a high level of material science, highly automated. And their manufacturing facilities operate extremely well. So really this is really about how do we leverage our sourcing capabilities, combine procurement and purchasing. How do we pursue opportunities where we're buying from outside parties and we can replace that with HellermannTyton product. And then over the medium term how do we drive more revenue growth in the margin structure that they have?","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And we think those are meaningful. Now the $50 million in synergies that we've talked about, those are hard cost savings related to sourcing initiatives as well as supply chain initiatives. But we think there's upside, ultimately on the revenue side.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then maybe on the other minority investments, I was wondering if you could tell us are there any options to buy embedded in those agreements? Or right of first refusal and should we look at this is almost a built in pipeline for you if these investments develop enough?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. I would say each is somewhat different. I would say ultimately it presents an opportunity to potentially buy but nearer term they're structured in a way where how do we both optimize our existing capabilities so that we can develop technologies that we can commercialize and sell into the automotive industry.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. Congrats.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line do Dan Galves of Credit Suisse.","Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Could you give us an update or do you have a pro forma leverage number after these transactions? Could you remind us of what your corporate targets are for that? And maybe give us an update on what the M&A pipeline looks like going forward?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. I think the transaction adds based on how we're financing roughly half a turn of leverage on a full debt to EBITDA, net debt to EBITDA basis so I think that brings our debt to EBITDA leverage up to about a little under one and a half times.","The M&A pipeline remains very strong. There are several opportunities out there. There are a lot in and around software and technology that Jeff talked about that we're evaluating and looking at. There are others that sit within the Powertrain, Electronics and Safety as well as Electrical Architecture that are consistent with the businesses and product lines that we're in. We feel as though, I should finish up, given the cash flow generation of the business, given the leverage that will be pro forma for this transaction we have ample capacity to do more transactions.","Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And to also continue to buyback at the current level?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Listen, I think that's what our expectation is now. That would be adjusted up or down depending on what sort of M&A activity transpires.","Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. And just one on the technology side. Could you give us a sense of how the Ottomatika software works? Does it work in conjunction with what Mobileye provides the Tier 1s in terms of vision based systems, and can you just give us a sense of how they work in tandem or what the differences are?","Jeffrey J. Owens - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP","Yeah, this is Jeff. So the way to think about the Mobileye software is it becomes like the central controlling software for the vehicle control. So it'll take inputs from the radar and our algorithms, for example, it'll take input from the vision system we provide and the Mobileye algorithms. It'll take input from medium and short-range radars. It'll take input from a driver state monitor. Vehicle to vehicle information when that's available, those kinds of things. It puts all that together and will project decision paths for the vehicle.","So based on what it sees and how the vehicle is operating it's constantly calculating forward paths. So given any number of things that can happen, as we all know in our day-to-day drives it's already pre-calculated a plan of action and will have the vehicle move out on that path. So it's evaluating, its route planning and then it'll instigate the action when a particular circumstance occurs. So it synthesizes all of the information from all of the sensors on the vehicle and that's why it's kind of a master computer if you will for the advanced driver assistance system.","Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner of CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Just first one quick follow up on China. I think you were clear that you expect to keep outperforming the market quite meaningfully. When you just look at what has been happening over the past few months, obviously production schedules have come down a bit. I used to think some even minor shift in terms of content decision, are you seeing auto makers that would say for example, we want to put in a GDi on the next platform but now that the market is moving down market and there's pricing pressure on the vehicles maybe we don't need that right now?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Nothing material at this point in time Emmanuel. Not really.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. That's good to hear. And then just one additional question on the Hellermann I'm not familiar with their product portfolio. So can you maybe just contrast what they offer in terms of how that corresponds with your product offering?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. Listen, we do manufacture product today that is consistent with the HellermannTyton product portfolios. We manufacture internally roughly, I don't know $40 million or so, $50 million of product today that is consistent with what they do. As I mentioned, we sell north of $300 million of that sort of product that we source internally from them as well as from others. Their product tends to be rather than connectors really it's highly engineered cable management solutions, so fixings and products like that that helps manage the flow of cable through the car.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. So you're saying you're one of the big customers there? So any sense of how much you are buying from them so far?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. We purchase close to $50 million a year from them in product.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Understood. Thank you very much.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","We're amongst their top five customers and have been for a very long time. In fact, their CEO is one of 14 members that sit on our supplier council that we meet with on a regular basis and talk about where our business is going and how do we do things strategically with our supply base where we optimize the supply chain and cost solutions and at the same time make decisions that benefit them as well.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","That's great to hear. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Oh great. Thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned that the multiple that you're paying for Hellermann is, can you actually give the EBITDA multiple with synergies that you're calculating as something in the low 9% type range? I wasn't sure how that compares to it.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","We apologize and Jessica mentioned this at the front end. Just given U.K. Takeover laws we can't. I think I can help you somewhat reverse engineer into that, but we talked about $50 million of run rate synergies and a multiple that is below Delphi's current trading multiple, a little bit below our current 2015 EBITDA multiple. So I think if you use that $50 million you back in and you look at transaction value you should be able to come up with a gross and a net.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And that's based on...","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And I apologize for having to be less than clear on it, but that's the legal requirement.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","But that's based on consensus for 2015 (1:04:07)?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, I think that's reasonable, it's a good assumption.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And how does this \u2013 can you remind us how this compares to the MVL acquisition in terms of what you paid for that business?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","We bought MVL \u2013 we reached agreement in early 2012. We closed late 2012. We paid 7.5 times for that. We got roughly two turns of \u2013 when we purchased the business, roughly two turns of synergies. When I compare and contrast the two businesses, MVL was growing mid-single digits and had EBITDA margins in the mid-teens. This is a business that in the aggregate has been growing consistently north of 10% on an FX-adjusted basis and as I said in my opening comments, has EBITDA margins that are roughly 20%. So two \u2013 although MVL is a great business and we did a lot with it, two very different businesses at two very different stages. Different growth profiles, different margin structures and very different competitive positions within the markets they operate.","HellermannTyton is number one in a number of the major markets that they operate in, including places like Germany, like Japan. So they have a very strong competitive position. They have a brand that goes back to the 1930's and is very well recognized and have an absolutely superb management team that executes extremely well.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Is there any way to provide any color on the other people looking at the asset? Was it mostly autos or is this more of a tech type asset?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No. I mean, listen, I can't tell you whether others have been looking at it. This is a business, though, as I said we know the company well and the management team well and we've had dialogues periodically with them.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And this is my last question. Any color, I think you said $50 million is the headwind from reception. Is that Q4? Or is that a second half? What is the annualized hit from the reception?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So annualized is about $100 million.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right, so there's the second half. Okay. So it's already done. All right. Thank you very much.","Jessica L. Holscott - Vice President-Investor Relations","Great. Thank you for participating in today's call.

My name is Jarenda and I'll be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Delphi Technologies' First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being accorded and simultaneously webcast.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sherief Bakr, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sherief, please go ahead.","Sherief Bakr","Thank you, Jarenda, and good morning and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Delphi Technologies' first quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today in London is our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Dauch; and our Chief Financial Officer, Vivid Sehgal.","This call will include a discussion of our first quarter 2019 financial results as disclosed in today's press release as well as our full year 2019 outlook. In order to follow along with today's presentation, you can find an accompanying set of slides on our Investor Relations website at ir.delphi.com.","Please note that our discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to their corresponding GAAP measures in the tables within our press release.","Now, before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q as well as other filings with the SEC. I'd encourage all of you to review these risk factors listed in these documents.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Dauch","Thank you, Sherief, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Before I comment on our Q1 performance, I want to provide a quick update on my first 115 days as CEO and tell you why I'm even more bullish today about our future here at Delphi Technologies. We will then take you through the details of our first quarter performance and our outlook for the full year before we take your questions.","Let's move to Slide 2, as I mentioned on last quarter's call, I've spent the majority of my first three months here at Delphi Technologies, traveling the world getting to know and gaining a deeper understanding of the company. This included spending extensive time meeting with our executive and site leadership teams, and our truly diverse and global workforce, visiting our 30 plus operating sites and technical centers, learning about our product portfolios, business models, internal processes and systems and visiting customers and suppliers and identify meaningful opportunities to improve our business.","Now travels around the globe literally in 80 days included visiting and assessing 90% of our sites in 12 countries, holding 28 Townhall sessions that are global locations, receiving direct feedback from our workforce from than 6,000 of our employees to handwritten 5x7 cards.","Meeting face-to-face with eight of our top 10 customers, hosting 26 of our key suppliers at a supplier day, file by on-site visits of three of our critical GDI component suppliers, reviewing all of our major transition service and contract manufacturing units with our former parent, which I'm pleased to say remain on track.","Undertaking a thorough announcement of our corporate overhead cost and structures including our extensive global engineering footprint and taking a deep dive into our GDI and power electronics businesses and the detailed plans we have in place to deliver improved profitability in these areas.","Speaking with the number of our top shareholders, individually interviewing the top 50 executive leaders here at Delphi Technologies, and recruiting and adding new leadership talent to the company in a few key areas of business. The bottom line, I now have a much deeper understanding of our business and what we need to do going forward to prioritize our resources and to create shareholder value.","If you recall, I also talked in my first earnings call about how I believe we have a unique opportunity here to create a great company at Delphi Technologies. Based on what I've seen and learned over the last three months, I came via two main conclusions; our strategic direction and portfolio of choices are fundamentally right and we have even more potential than I had initially thought but at the start of the year.","More potential to better serve and grow our customers across the globe as our industry works through major powertrain propulsion system transformations and more potential to improve our financial performance. Once we get beyond our near-term spin related and technology ship headwinds, improve our GDI operational performance, streamline our overall cost structure and become a true lean system company.","Slide 3 relates out my assessment in a bit more detail and I bucket them into what I call the five Ps; people, products, partners, processes and profits. Before getting in some of the details, the areas where I see the most potential for improvement and where we are performing at less than peer group benchmark levels fall on three main categories.","First, our process discipline, IT systems and lean tools across the company. Second, our overall SG&A spend and organizational structure and three, our engineering footprint and spend. Improving our performance in these areas will be key to our future success and will improve our free cash flow performance and provide additional options for us to allocate capital more effectively in the future.","Let me cover the CEO scorecard and let me start with what I consider to be our strengths for our green areas and that\u2019s our people and our products. At Delphi Technologies, our greatest strengths reside in our deep-rooted technical heritage and our capabilities. It is the foundational strength of our company and a great foundation to build upon and it all starts with our people.","As I met with a number of our largest customers and visit our technical centers and surround the globe, it quickly confirm my initial view that we have a dedicated and technically skilled workforce that designs, test, validates, produces and supplies cutting-edge and industry-leading products that fit at the crossroads and part of the propulsion revolution underway in our industry.","We have a long established engineering leadership position in internal combustion engines, electronics, software and controls and in many areas we are the technology pioneers in our industry.","As a pure play propulsion company that bridges traditional, internal combustion engine and electric propulsion technology, our customers recognize and appreciate how we are able to help them, improve vehicle performance and the drive expense for their customers, specifically in the areas of fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.","Our product technology leadership and the depth of our customer relationship truly differentiate us from our peers and will allow us to outpace industry from a growth perspective going forward.","This is evidenced by the strong commercial wins we have secured over the last two years in three key areas of our product portfolio; commercial vehicle diesel and automotive gas direct inject fuel injection systems and power electronics, where we have unique, proprietary and patented technology.","How we execute on these wins will clearly be an important driver of our future financial performance. In one of my priorities have been on ensuring we have the right processes, systems and resources both human and financial capital in place to support our future profitable growth in these areas.","Turning to our primary business partners which I\u2019ll define today as our customers and our suppliers. On the green side, we have a very strong relationship with our customers across the globe, many of whom are relying on us to help them meet increasingly stringent regulatory targets, focus on cleaner and more efficient vehicles for both passenger car and commercial vehicle application.","Often we have embedded engineers working directly with the OEM engineering teams to co-develop the next generation propulsion products and software solutions. These technical partnerships are long-term and deep-seated going back many decades. This plays to our strengths and gives us tremendous opportunity to drive long-term growth with existing customers and the potential to expand our global presence, especially with Asian based commercial vehicle OEMs with the European-based partners.","The rapid transitions from diesel and gasoline and from ICE to electric compulsion systems while treating difficult operational challenges and heavy investments today we will undoubtedly benefit Delphi Technologies on the other side of the transition.","On the yellow side of the bar\u2013 place our supplier relationships. It\u2019s clear that we have some more to do here in terms of improving our decision-making, use of common systems and production forecasting methodologies. We are already making some near-term organizational changes in this area and I would dig in even deeper to our supply chain management processes in the second quarter.","This leaves me to processes where we are clearly not world-class and have a significant opportunity to drive more efficiency, speed and flexibility into the way we operate our business. We have all the tools in place, capable people, great equipment and our plants and technical centers but we must do a much better job of putting in the systems and the processes that tie the various functions and tools together.","We are not a truly lean company in terms of our cash conversion cycle as compared to our Tier 1 peers and we are addressing these issues immediately. It starts with discipline and efficient product engineering, on-time sourcing to and management of our supply base and then world-class operational performance and inventory management at our factories.","We can and we will get better in these critically important areas. We will soon start our lean system journey here at Delphi Technologies using a proven system that is an effective for me over the past 20 years at other companies.","All of this leads to our financial performance. While our Q1 performance was solid and better than our own forecast, I am by no means happy with our current level of profitability. The bad news is then in the shorter term we are fighting through some major market swings and technology transitions that are negatively impacting our business and some of our peers as well.","The good news is that I do see a number of opportunities improve our long-term financial performance to what I would call self-help measures. These are target rich opportunities which we will address quickly and cost effectively.","First, we\u2019re going to execute on our initiatives to improve GDI probability and this is our number one priority here at Delphi Technologies. Second, reducing our SG&A as we complete the roll-off of the TSAs and focus on getting more efficiencies throughout the organization.","This includes simplified organizational structure to eliminate unnecessary layers of bureaucracy, having greater discipline across the company in how we invest and spend money and three, utilizing common processes and IT systems across the company.","Third, taking the opportunity to simplify our engineering footprint and reduce our engineering spend. While we are a company that has undergone a major rotation of its manufacturing footprint over the last two years, my site visits across the globe underscored my initial view that we have an overly complex engineering footprint with overlapping capabilities, capacity, staffing relatively what we truly need to support our customers.","No doubt addressing these three key areas will require a lot of fundamental hard work and based on my previous experience will likely take us into 2021 to complete some of the necessary changes to become a world-class company.","As a leadership team, we are aligned in the key areas that we need to address whether that would be SG&A, engineering, supply chain, manufacturing performance or program management and we are working at pace to define the actions we will take to significant improve both our operational and financial performance.","That work is well underway, prioritizing the quick wins we can achieve in the short term or being very thoughtful to ensure we focus our efforts in the right places to drive sustainable, long-term value here at Delphi Technologies.","Let me provide you with a few of the changes that we\u2019ve already made in the past 60 days. We now have a cross functional SWAT team in place dedicated to improving our GDI profitability. I personally receive a 40 page deck every Monday that tracks our key operational performance metrics at our five GDI plants, issues are addressed, resources are allocated and decisions are made weekly to drive improvements.","We will also conduct quarterly on-site operation views that our key to European plans that are currently in launch mode on GDI. This stronger focus and higher level focus is already delivered improved results at our operations. We are implementing a new program and launch management process called Foursquare that raises divide visibility of our major capital projects to the C-Suite level on a monthly or quarterly basis.","We hired a season executive who I have worked with before to leave these efforts and kickoff the process in April and we\u2019ll have first in-depth reviews at my level in May. Previously our program management system was to administrative in nature and issues were not addressed at the right level until it's too late leading to poor and costly launch performances for the last two years.","As I mentioned earlier our team has been trained on and understand many of the individual tools using the lean process of the Toyota production system. But we do not fully understand how to make those tools work across the entire value stream. We have identified 16 of our 24 major operating sites that are stable enough to start the transition to lean systems over this summer and we will go through a three-year hands-on training and implementation process that radically changes how we operate our plants and manage our supply chain.","I have led this same transition at over 60 plants in the past 20 years and I am confident we'll see marked improvement in our operating financial metrics going forward once that system takes place and takes root. We pulled our senior leaders and technical leaders together and took a companywide look rather than a business unit or specific technical center view at our global engineering resources, footprint and lab equipment usage.","What we found are many opportunities to improve in this area. We're in the process of analyzing what we have and what we need going forward and identifying the opportunities we have to reduce our operating and future CapEx cost in the engineering area. We're also doing a deep dive into our forecasted post spin SG&A costs. Let me just say there are plenty of opportunities to improve in this area and we will.","Finally, we are starting to take a hard look at our current IT systems, networks, applications hardware and staffing needs. Let me say the team has done a tremendous almost Herculean job in completing the spin related tasks to-date on time.","However, what we inherited in this area is far from world-class and I see another significant opportunity for us to invest and get better in the future. We expect to complete our analysis of each of these key areas over the next few months and will develop plans to address them in a cost-effective manner over the next two or three years.","Let\u2019s turn to the next slide and talk about immediate priorities. In the more immediate term we are laser focused on ensuring we meet our 2019 objectives. While we are off to a solid start in 2019 we also continue to operate in very dynamic marketplace conditions especially in China. More broadly we see certain macroeconomic, geopolitical and regulatory factors which continue to cause uncertainty across the value chain.","I expect the choppiness we have experienced this last summer will continue over the coming quarters as we deal with industry-wide powertrain technology transitions and macroeconomic impacts which include the transition from passenger cars diesel to gasoline engines especially here in Europe, the projected growth and timing of electrification mostly in China and in Europe at this point as well as the ongoing trade and tariff dynamics around the globe.","Our teams are continuing to work close with our customers to ensure that we are on top of any regional market, regulatory or technology changes that may occur to ensure we are able to adapt accordingly and rapidly as necessary. During this uncertain period I expect my leadership team to work with urgency and decisiveness making the tough choices, needed to balance delivering near-term results while support our long-term profitable growth ambitions.","In terms of where we have more control my shorter-term priorities continue to be first, ensuring we complete our full transition to a standalone company and are right-sized to support our growth plans. Second, executing our plan to improve GDI profitability which, includes improving our operational performance on installed equipment and flawlessly launching new plant and production lines over the next 18 to 24 months. We are making good progress here and our GDI business remains on track to breakeven by the end of 2020.","Third, ensuring we have the right foundations and resources to properly scale up Power Electronics business. This includes building and launching three new plants in 2019 all projects in this area were on time and on budget during the first quarter. The upfront cost to build our ENE foundation's are currently weighing on our business. This includes the construction of the three plants, the purchase, installation and qualification of hundreds of piece of equipment and the hiring and training of our new workforce at those locations. We are operationally on track and continue to expect to get Power Electronics to breakeven in 2020.","Fourth [inaudible] great work our leadership team has done to improve the profitability and position our aftermarket business for accelerated and profitable growth. I'm extremely encouraged by the deep experience of our aftermarket leadership team. They have a detailed plan to properly grow on a global basis and they are executing on that plan. The strength of the Delphi brand is a strong enabler for our aftermarket business. I believe this business is a hidden gems for us with strong free cash flow, potential to help us fund our overall global company growth.","And fifth completing the work to define the specific actions we will take to become a great company for all our stakeholders. That is a nice way for me to say we are doing a lot of hard work and analyzing key market trends, our overall cost structure, our business systems here at Delphi Technologies to identify and prioritize where we must move and move quickly to make the company better. As we make decisions we will convey them to you on a timely and as appropriate basis.","Let me move to Slide 5 and before I turn the call to Vivid Slide 5 gives you a high level recap of our first quarter performance which from an adjusted operating income perspective came in a little ahead of our expectations. In our full-year basis, we now expect to be towards the higher end of our adjusted EPS outlook range. From an operational transitional perspective we are on track with some of our key initiatives such as completing our [inaudible] test on time executing the challenging transition from diesel to gasoline. As well as expanding our manufacturing capacity for our CV fuel injection systems at our Stonehouse plant.","Revenue of 1.15 billion for Q1 was consistent with the outlook we provided on last quarter's call. Vivid will cover the key drivers behind the year-on-year decline revenue as well as some of the global line favorability that led to the better than expected EPS performance. Operating cash flow of 21 million was impacted by the timing of inventory builds relative to the uncertainty around Brexit. And we also began our share repurchase program in the quarter returning 15 million of cash to our shareholders.","From a growth bookings perspective, we have 1.6 billion of wins in the quarter in line with where we expected to be at this stage in the year. We continue to have strong momentum in key areas of our portfolio with customers across the globe and our wins in the quarter included a significant GDI program with a major European OEM for industry leading 350 bar fuel injection systems. A four year contract extension with a major global commercial vehicle customer for our heavy-duty diesel fuel injection systems and for Power Electronics we booked additional volume with a leading global OEMs our inverter and onboard charging solutions.","We continue to see high level of pursuits from both our ISE product portfolio and our electronic and electrification portfolios and remain focused on leveraging our disciplined commercial strategy deliver long-term value. More specifically we see opportunity to secure material business wins particularly on the Power Electronics side and in the CV segment over the coming quarters. And I remain very confident that we\u2019ll have another year of strong new business wins in 2019.","In summary we are off to a solid start in 2019 my orientation to the company is fundamentally complete. We are on track with our key initiatives such as improving profitability in GDI and Power Electronics. And my team and I ready to take control and drive technologies to higher level of performance in the near future.","With that I'll turn the call over Vivid.","Vivid Sehgal","Thank you Rick good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. My remarks will focus on our Q1 performance, our full year outlook and some of the below the line actions which take us closer to the top end of our EPS outlook range as well as providing additional commentary on how we see our phasing over the balance of the year and the drivers of our margin improvement into the second half of 2019.","Looking at Q1 performance in more detail on Slide 6 revenue of $1.15 billion in the quarters declined by 6.4% year on year slightly better than the overall market decline of almost 7%. Consistent with recent quarters our Q1 performance was driven by double-digit growth in Power Electronics and commercial vehicle which was offset by expected lower sales in China and lower passenger car diesel revenues in Europe.","In addition, we saw some revenue softness in our aftermarket business primarily due to the timing of certain customer programs that shifted into Q2. I'll come back to this in my later remarks. Adjusted operating income of $87 million or 7.6% margin declined by 470 basis points year-on-year yet came in slightly ahead of expectations.","On an adjusted basis, our first quarter operating margin benefited from the timing of customer recoveries that we had assumed would be recognized in Q2. Excluding this, our adjusted operating income for the quarter and our expectations for the first half of 2019 are essentially in line with the outlook that we provided in February.","Adjusted EPS of $0.67 was stronger than expected driven in part by the higher operating income performance as well as some below the line favorability, most notably lower minority interest as well as a slightly favorable tax and interest expense. Consistent with our priority to focus on costs and cash flow in a softer growth environment, I was particularly pleased with some of the actions we executed in Q1.","These included completing the roll-off of a number of key TSAs particularly in IT, closing our final salary pension scheme to future accrual in the U.K. and lowering our expected full-year interest expense. The result of these actions is expected to benefit our adjusted EPS over the course of 2019 and beyond.","Given our U.K. footprint, we also took appropriate actions in the quarter to offset some of the potential supply chain disruption related to a no deal Brexit, resulting in an incremental inventory build of approximately $20 million which impacted our operating cash flow in quarter 1. We expect to unwind this in the second half of the year subject to the outcome of Brexit negotiations. Finally, CapEx of $131 million in the quarter is consistent with our front-end loaded phasing for the year given the strong current and future demand we see for GDI and Power Electronics as well as expected onetime CapEx related to the separation from our former parent as we build three new plants for our electronics and electrification business and establish our own IT infrastructure.","Our full-year CapEx outlook is unchanged. Turning to slide 7, which provides more details on our revenue progression in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong year-on-year growth in two key areas of the portfolio namely Power Electronics and Commercial Vehicle which both saw revenue increases of approximately 10% in the quarter.","The Power Electronics revenue growth in Q1 was slightly lower than expected due to a slower program ramp in China which we expect to accelerate through the balance of the year. However on a full-year basis and beyond, we continue to expect very strong growth and as Rick indicated, we have great momentum with customers.","GDI revenues came in slightly ahead of our expectations only declining by approximately 5% year-on-year primarily related to lower revenues in China. Over the course of 2019, we expect sales of our newer 350 Bar GDI products to be an important driver of our revenue performance particularly in the second half of the year.","As you can see on the right side of our slide from a total company perspective, revenue in Europe increased by 3% as growth in commercial vehicle and GDI was again offset by the ongoing decline in passenger car diesel revenues. Revenue in North America was impacted by the expected changes in production schedules, I referenced last quarter which more than offset continued growth in commercial vehicle.","Finally, our sales in China declined by 29% in line with our expectations driven by the combination of market softness as well as our own customer mix. Slide 8 walks through our operating income performance for Q1. Adjusted operating income was $87 million down from $159 million in the prior year quarter. This is primarily driven by unfavorable mix, lower industry production particularly in China, unfavorable FX dynamics, higher commodity and tariff related costs as well as higher year-on-year spin related costs. This was partially offset by ongoing improvements in materials and manufacturing performance, overall cost control including lower engineering spend as well as the timing of customer recoveries related to GDI.","Turning to our segment performance on the next slide, on a year-on-year basis Powertrain Systems adjusted revenue declined by 7% in the quarter as growth in lower electronics and commercial vehicle was more than offset by lower revenues in passenger car diesel as well as softness in GDI and ongoing transitions within our own customer mix in China.","Adjusted operating margin of 7.5% was down 480 basis points year-on-year primarily due to the factors I just described most notably unfavorable mix primarily related to the ongoing transitions away from higher margin passenger car diesel, higher launch costs related to new GDI and power electronics programs and plants, lower overall volumes and to a lesser degree foreign exchange commodity and tariff related headwinds.","In the shorter term, and as Rick referenced, one of our key priorities is ensuring we execute on our initiatives to improve GDI and power electronics profitability. I was pleased with the progress we made in the first quarter particularly in GDI and our teams remain highly focused to deliver the profitability improvements we have targeted.","Turning to our aftermarket segment on Slide 10, on a year-on-year basis our Q1 aftermarket performance was impacted by the timing of certain customer programs. And we remain on track to deliver our full-year outlook of low single digit revenue growth and adjusted operating margin expansion. Revenue of $193 million in the quarter declined by 6% on an adjusted basis.","Adjusted operating margin declined by 220 basis points year-on-year driven by lower sales, unfavorable foreign exchange mix and the timing of new programs with independent aftermarket customers which are now expected to occur in Q2. In addition, aftermarket adjusted operating margin was impacted by higher year-on-year tariff headwinds.","Now let's move on to our outlook for 2019. Slide 11 highlights our outlook for the year which is essentially unchanged and our solid Q1 performance puts us on track to deliver on our full-year revenue, adjusted income and operating cash flow targets. From adjusted EPS perspective, the below the line favorability we saw in Q1 and expectations for the balance of the year positions us towards the high-end of our EPS outlook range.","More broadly we continue to expect 2019 to be a transitional year with an acceleration of our own mix dynamics as well as continued macro uncertainty and industry headwinds. From a global production perspective, we still expect to see an approximately 2% decline in 2019 with China down by approximately 8%. We also continue to expect strong growth in power electronics 350 Bar GDI and commercial vehicle revenues offset by the ongoing decline in passenger car diesel.","And as I mentioned earlier, we expect the aftermarket segment to deliver growth this year with growth returning in Q2. On a full-year outlook, continues to include headwinds related to ongoing trade and tariff dynamics as well as commodity exposure.","In total this equated to approximately $20 million of higher costs in our previous 2019 outlook. During Q1, we saw a number of puts and takes related to the trade and border situations between the U.S. and other nations such as China and Mexico. In addition, we saw some additional cost pressure related to certain commodities. Putting this all together, our earlier estimate of approximately $20 million headwind for 2019 is unchanged while we\u2019re not providing a specific quarterly EPS outlook, I wanted to spend a few minutes on how we see our phasing through the year.","Starting with Q2, from a revenue perspective we expect a low to mid single digit adjusted revenue decline with strong year-on-year revenue growth for the aftermarket segment. As I mentioned earlier and as you will see on the next slide, our adjusted operating margin outlook for the first half of 2019 is essentially unchanged.","Consistent with this and given our stronger than expected margin performance in Q1, we now expect Q2 margin to be in the similar range to quarter 1. On the last quarter's call, I provided some additional color and commentary on the drivers of the stronger margin performance, we expect to achieve in the second half of the year. As you can see on Slide 12, those drivers are essentially unchanged. On a full-year basis, we remain on track to deliver on the approximately 9% adjusted operating margin outlook. From a volume perspective, we expect to see modestly higher growth in the second half of the year given the phasing of our launch activity which we expect will more than offset the declines in roll loss we expect elsewhere in our mix.","What we have added to the slide is our perspective on how we break down that approximately 300 basis points of margin improvement from H1 to H2 between areas that we can control or a specific to Delphi Technologies versus external dynamics. Consistent with my comments on last quarter's call approximately three quarters of the drivers are in areas that are within our control.","Specifically, first the phasing of our cost in 2019 both in terms of engineering and spin related costs which are expected to decline in the second half of the year. As mentioned, we are on track to exit a number of transition service agreements with our former parent throughout the year which will eliminate duplicate costs particularly in the back half of the year and second improvement in our manufacturing and materials performance consistent with the cadence we have delivered in prior years partially offset by higher depreciation expenses.","In terms of the market and macro drivers, these include incremental volume including launch activity in GDI and power electronics partially offset by the continued declines in passenger car diesel and the expected improvement in aftermarket margin in the second half of the year.","So in closing and before we take your questions, we had a solid Q1 relative to our expectations. Given the continued macro and industry uncertainties, my focus which is aligned with Rick will remain on cost control and operating cash generation while continuing to invest to support our longer term growth.","With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","John Murphy","Just a first question, I mean Rick you were talking about all the efforts that you have in sort of planning your thought process, it seems like there's still a lot to come as far as execution in turnaround once we get into 2020, so I guess the question is when we look at the second half margin of 10% to 11%.","Have you worked through everything you're focused on how much more opportunity is there on margin and where do you really ultimately think it needs to go to justify to get a good return on invested capital because it seems like it's been in 12% to 13% range but it seems like you make a whole lot more room than another 100, 200 basis points versus where you are in the second half based on everything you're talking about. So how do you think about sort of where this ultimately can go?","Rick Dauch","Great question, John. I went back and looked at where this business was in the past and where we ended up in the year, last year where we are this year, we're kind of in that transitional stage right now, I'd say it's too early to commit to where we're going to be in 2020. I do think we can be better. I think that as David just covered, we're going to have a different run rate in the back half of this year than we have in the first half of this year and what we had in the fourth quarter last year.","We are right in the middle. I didn't really quite understand this when I first got here. We're in launch mode at six or seven plants. We're basically starting up three new greenfield sites one in Poland, one in China, one in Mexico building them from the ground up new equipments where someplace we're rebadging people, some we\u2019re hiring new people up the train and about to make electronic components, so that's a big challenge for us.","And then I didn't realize we had five plants in GDI mode right now, right. Two are pretty stable but they're getting their next round of capacity and three are still in launch mode right now and these are very tight times parts. So we have a lot of hard work to do on the operational standpoint.","So that's one and nothing I've seen in any of those plants makes me nervous or scared it's just executions, hard roll up your sleeves. Manufacturing one to one supply chain, one to one work and we'll get there. And the second part is I'm getting a better feel, I don't have 100% feel yet of the overhead costs in this company because we're kind of in this transition stage between standing up being a part of a publicly held company all by ourselves.","So I've got to sit with dividend and go back and forth on that in terms of what's just pure transitional duplication IT. Some of the other stuff, we're doing here. When does that go away and then when can we get 100% controls like so I can take out some of the costs. Vivid, you want to say anything?","Vivid Sehgal","Yes, I think John it's great to have Rick on board with them, the focus of the company right now. It feels like we're getting our stuff together, we've really got to focus on the cost and that should give us some confidence as we go forward. What I would say just, we're not going to lean into 2020 right now. There is still a lot of work to do for the second half of the year but which we feel confident with.","But what I would say is that the trends that we see as Rick said in the second half of this year primarily around the TSA and cost saving as well as the margin expansion opportunities that we see in power electronics and GDI, those transitions and those movements that we see in the second half, we certainly do expect those to continue into 2020 and we do expect margin expansion coming into the 2020 timeframe.","But Rick and I've spent a lot of time. We do have risks and we've just got to put those on the table as well. We are conscious about some of the risks that are we're seeing some softness in Europe right now. We've got to look at sort of CV and North America. We're looking at launch profiles in China, they don't worry us at all. But we've just got to be very cautious and that's why we're just going to hold off a little longer before we provide any further color.","Rick Dauch","And John, we go back on the Powertrain side of the business, on the GDI side this is an industry wide fund call from diesel to gasoline. None of us in the area have enough capacity in place and yet the demand for it is extensive as the European OEMs try to get ahead of the new regulations that are coming their way.","So that's an interesting situation where we have to run as hard as we can to get as much equipment in place to get ahead of the launch curve. And quite honestly, when I got here we were behind the launch curve, we\u2019re getting buried. And so now I think we're getting back on top of it. On the E&E side of the business, it's a combination of we're basically standing up our own footprint, we\u2019re almost a startup company with a lot of heritage and it\u2019s kind of start and stop based on government regulations, how fast electrification is going to go, right.","We went to that, go in place how are they going to do that Chinese different centers and what type of vehicles and in Europe what about the European regulations, so there's a lot of moving pieces here and that's why at least I'm not ready and Vivid made sure, I'm not ready for sure to get too far ahead of my ski trips here and go up to 2020. Let's just knock it out one quarter of time and make sure we deliver our 2019 results.","John Murphy","Then a second question, I mean the aftermarket it sounds like it was dedicated to where the first quarter was weak because of some order timing. What's going on there and why are you so confident, it could have inflect through the rest of the year?","Rick Dauch","First of all, let me say I only had to spend a few days so far with the aftermarket team by less than five. We have a very competent leadership team that's come together. They have deep experience 20 to 25 years. That's a great combination out there. We've got a great brand in Delphi. We've got an excellent product mix there. I think that business can run and as long as we are able to feed it with the right working capital to put the right inventory in place. We can grow that business.","That's a big upside for us. Longer term, first quarter there were a couple of specific customer issues in North America that are going to shift over, their decision not ours and so we're ready to go. Yes, you should see better results in the second quarter.","John Murphy","And then just lastly on the China customer mix, I mean how should we think about the timing in that kind of maybe anniversarying or you being able to diversify into some of the international players that might help offset that mix or maybe the domestic to actually get stronger through the course of the year, what's -- when should we expect an inflection there?","Rick Dauch","Yes, I'll start with that. I spent about 14 days over in Asia and got to meet with all the big Chinese suppliers. I did not, a customer that did not meet with a lot of smaller Chinese customers. There's definitely a trend where the big guys are going to win and take more market share.","Some of that is because of what they have to offer in the product portfolio and their footprint, part of that is government putting their thumb on the scale a little bit to choose winners and losers and try to streamline, there's a lot of players over there.","It's got to go through a shake out of consolidation. And one of the ways you do that is through the government incentive program regulations and so we're waiting on more than our fair share with the big guys. Unfortunately, right now it's impacting us as the smaller guys where we have had a really strong position doing completed systems there, losing some share and we're monitoring that very closely. Timing wise I think it is going to play out over the next 18, 24 months. Is that fair?","Vivid Sehgal","No, I think that's exactly right. If you look at what we said at the beginning of the year, we said that our sort of revenue in China for the year is in that minus mid single digit range and that meant that our local OEM customers were going down around about the 30% range and we were sort of driving launch profiles to drive that. We haven\u2019t seen much change right now in that cadence that we\u2019re looking at. So I think Rick is spot on when he says that the impact of the transition will continue for the next 12 to 18 months of which point we switched out seeing normalized levels.","Operator","Our next question is from Colin Langan from UBS. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [inaudible] on for Collin. You mentioned Power Electronics build-out I was just wondering if you could talk about the margin impact. And then what that looks like this year and maybe anything beyond that as well?","Richard Dauch","Can you repeat that question for a second.","Unidentified Analyst","Sorry the Power Electronics build-out that you guys are doing just wondering about the margin impact for this year and anything beyond that as well?","Vivid Sehgal","Yes, certainly hi Vivid here the plan for Power Electronics if I go forward when we first \u2013 first of all Power Electronics is exactly in line with our expectations from what we said previously last year and output range. But then we would get to a breakeven run rate by the end of 2020 and the revenue profile of the company would be in that sort of $500 million range. So we are in exactly the right place that we need to be. We did talk and Rick talked about the CapEx that we\u2019re putting into place which is impacted higher than expected CapEx that we had for this year we\u2019re running pace to put that in \u2013 and to make it successful.","For this year, we are definitely still as expected to be in the negative operating income margin range but not quite specified what that is. But I would say is we are going to be in a position where the second half Power Electronics margin will incrementally improve and we will see that improvement right through H2 2019 right through till 2020 to a run rate breakeven position at the end of 2020. So we\u2019re perfectly on track right there.","Richard Dauch","Is to make couple comment I have been to all four, I have been three, let me see I have been to four of five electronics plants right. Kokomo is our original plant, it's an okay plant it\u2019s not anywhere near lean and we already talked about that. Suzhou is a world-class plant world-class leadership team there and growing like crazy right it\u2019s going to be one of our biggest plant in next four years. They are further down the pipe in terms of moving from the start up to production.","Baloney over in Poland the building just got finished we got our first wave of equipment in the last 45 days. We got about 50 people who been spending the balance of the year being trained off-site in Hungary and other places. They just got qualified they built their first validated parts just less than two weeks ago. We had a congratulatory talk with them last week and then our Reynosa plant it just cut the walls up in the floor port and starting to get their equipment and we\u2019re starting to get people transitions.","So we're spending a hell of a lot of money to build these new factories whether it's going off equipment and suppliers and transporting into our site qualifying them, launching them, training our people, hiring the management team. In Poland alone we had to hire 300 people between now and the end of year to launch that plant. So that\u2019s a lot of expense just trust me I have launched several plants around the world with lot of money upfront.","And then finally get it to so but I'm confident they were on track to get to the breakeven point as Vivid said in 2020 and based on my conversations and meets with customers and the number of RFQs we have right now and the awards we\u2019re winning as a percentage of those quotes on I am very confident this will be a big part of our business in the future and a proper one.","Unidentified Analyst","And then could you just talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing in South America?","Richard Dauch","South America that\u2019s the one place I haven\u2019t been yet I had some ground representatives down there I think our sales rep down to South America.","Vivid Sehgal","Yes, I mean look we\u2019re pretty much in line with the market right now so South America is relatively out of regions it actually the smallest part of our region. We do have a good business there but right now we are tracking to the market. So right now in quarter one the market was roundabout sort of 6% and we sort of in that same region at this point in time so nothing unusual there we\u2019re tracking the market.","Richard Dauch","Yes, I had one of my previous bosses from American Axle that I worked for several years go down and look at that plant. He sent me a very strong positive feedback on that plant the workforce down there, the products, we sold old equipment there and I hope they get down to [inaudible] here in the second quarter or early third quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Armintas Sinkevicius","When I look at the margin here 7.6% in the first quarter and then moving to 10% to 11% in the second half. Are there any reasons why we can't just roll over the 10% 11% margins from second half into 2020?","Vivid Sehgal","So again \u2013 what I did say before was clearly that we believe that the trends have the right trends to be taking us into 2020. We\u2019re not at the position right now obviously Rick is still and the rest management team still looking through all the opportunities that we have right now. But what I would say is that we certainly expect margin expansion in 2020 and the trends that we see in the second half of 2019 would be a good proxy for what see happening in the sort of 2020 timeframe.","I think at the moment we just have to be cautious because there is a macro-economic headwinds like we\u2019ve said we\u2019re watching North America pretty carefully with saw we\u2019re watching all the regulatory issues in Europe and Brexit RDE and WRCE and some of the tires noise. And obviously in China we\u2019re watching the incentive programs pretty program pretty carefully right now I think we are on [inaudible] what that does. But let me give you some comfort we\u2019re tracking to be successful in 2019 H2 and that should form the good trends going into 2020.","Richard Dauch","Couple of things here I just came out of the CV industry for the last eight years and the projections I've read and what I thought before even I got to this company. So just give downturn likely in North American in CV that could way on this a little bit that's a good part of our business right now. We do expect to have improve margins on GDI next year as we get to the launches. And then we should be able to address some of our overhead costs once we get to the spin.","So those are all combination some plus, some minus, the wildcards are really some of the trade and macroeconomic issues in terms of Brexit U.S. trade issues and China market right. So those of kind of things we\u2019re a little bit [inaudible] we are wearing let\u2019s get to another quarter and kind of feel where we are with some of those things and those last things I talked about right of our control but we have to adjust to it.","Armintas Sinkevicius","So it sounds more macro based and sort of operational what\u2019s in your control. So what are the incremental\/decremental margins we should be thinking of for businesses like GDI and Power Electronics?","Vivid Sehgal","So in terms of the decremental margins they are pretty in line with what we've been saying I have given sort of data for the company as a whole right now. So our decremental margins at the moment given some of the higher-margin diesel and some of the ICE component businesses is in that 25% to 30% right now is the decrementals and from an incremental margin perspective it's relatively low this year. And we expect that to improve next year primarily that the growth is coming from the three major areas of the business which is Power Electronics, GDI and commercial vehicle.","Commercial vehicle is good operating income and gross margins so obviously that slightly above our company average while GDI and Power Electronics as we said is slightly below the company while they below breakeven at this point. So the incremental's right now are low single-digit while the decremental in that 25% to 30% range.","Richard Dauch","Yeah commercial vehicle right the volumes are so strong in North America that push us into a six and a half, seven day a week, work week. Those aren\u2019t the best ways to run the business. I like to run the plant five and a half, six days but every other Saturday. So when you're running double time on Sunday and you get some maps and tears and you\u2019re getting some premium freight back on the stuff. So we could do better so it would be actually nice for us at the commercial vehicle market backed off just a little bit. But my experience in North America that swings 50,000 to 100,000 trucks that's 25% and 30% so what the deals at next year.","Armintas Sinkevicius","And your evaluation to the plant it sounds like you know things are in relatively good shape here any sort of areas where you think there might need to be incremental spend to get the plant up to the standard you like to be at or operations at a level you like to be at?","Richard Dauch","I would say it\u2019s very few exceptions I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of our plasma conditions of our plants. In the last two or three jobs I did and I walked in the situations where it was massive capital required to clean up old junky equipment. I only found one site one part of a site in Mexico where we have some 30 or 40 old equipment that probably isn\u2019t the best we have in the world. I've heard that some of the equipment we have in Brazil is that way, but I don't see any major capital spend to go fixed things customers have told me that data suggest we have world class quality.","We're in the parts per billion, not parts per million. We have three or four plants as I said are in premium freight mode. And because we lacked capacity in the real opportunity, the great news is I think I can expedite the Lean journey because it's not replace a bunch of equipment, it's teach to people how to use the tools as a system rather than individual tools. And I don\u2019t want to bore you with a lean jargon.","But ask Kaizen Ishikawa diagrams, I have a system that I use that I was trained by ex-Toyota person. It's a 12 step process. As I said we're going to have 16 of our plants start that training process in July. I actually had the contract on my desk with this person and he's lined up four practitioners, who are Toyota veterans in North America primarily who are going to roll through our Chinese, our European and our North American plants on about every four to six week cadence.","And my experience in that is it takes about six months for the people to quite do all the hard work and math and they start seeing the results and then ultimately take off on fire. Those who don't, don't want to and they won't be on the team. So I don't make optional, you either get on the bus in terms of lean manufacturing you get off the Delphi Technologies bus, there's no choice there. That's my direction. How is that?","Armintas Sinkevicius","Okay, that\u2019s good.","Rick Dauch","I took a look with Vivid about how we benchmark our cash conversion cycle versus people like American acts or Warner or some of the guys where we have lot of opportunity here. How is that?","Operator","Our next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Noah Kaye","Just following up on power electronics. You commented that there was a slower than expected channel launch in 1Q, that in fact broke down a little bit. I guess I just want to sort of square that and obviously the changes to the subsidies that that were expected there with kind of how you're thinking about the medium term outlook. Again saying $500 million of revenue gets to kind of a break even in 2020. Just help us understand what kind of growth do you need to see from the industry to kind of get you there and how much of that has to be the high end plug in and battery ECs versus mile hybrids and it seems like there is a lot of different ways to get there but just want stance how you are thinking about it?","Rick Dauch","Sure. I mean look from our perspective, this one quarter that we have we expect lumpiness in launches that happen. We are very confident about our power electronics revenue growth right now, we are confident by the technology that we have.","We believe it's one of the best technologies out there in the market today. And we've always said that our compound annual growth rates will range somewhere up to 50% and we're not coming off those numbers. From an NEV subsidy perspective, we actually think in the longer run, this will actually support our growth potential largely because we actually believe that the NEV credit is going to effectively improve and sort of recognize those OEMs that have higher range.","And our strategy as you know is being naturally moving towards some of the top OEMs where range has been an important factor. So right now, our technology is both in the bets and we believe that the NEV credit situation in China is that can actually push even harder towards high voltage solutions as OEMs look for the increased range to maximize the NEV credits that are there.","So from our perspective with our bite technology, we believe that the bets right now are the ones that are actually generating the most traction for us and we actually think as the PITVs actually move forward to high range with battery in the next few years that actually plays to our strengths as well. ","So actually the NEV situation for us particularly in China is actually we think a positive step in the right direction because our Chinese local OE, the smaller range lower tier group. So we've been moving away from them and I think the best thing for us right now is if you look in our bookings over the last year or so, they are in that high voltage range which we think the NEV credits will actually support. So this is a positive for us and we look at this with optimism.","In terms of the revenue growth right now, I think we have enough in the tank to be relatively confident that the range of getting to break even power electronics at the $500 million plus range, we are on track right now and we don't see any changes to that cadence stage.","Noah Kaye","It was no right, is that you said?","Rick Dauch","This area is interesting to me because I didn't play it in the last eight or 10 years right. And so I'm getting educated by the team and by the customers right, first started with CES. There are several Chinese OEMs that I have never heard of my entire life that we're showing all these high end vehicles and they're really good looking vehicles but I don't know how much backing is behind those.","So going to be the next Tesla or what, right. Second thing I'd say is almost all the big European OEM are in a race on their high end cars to catch up to Tesla and they're driving pretty hard, right. So I don't know the answer to your question. That's one of the areas I've got to dig in with my team over the next 90 days. What I do know is this, electrification is real, it's coming fast, it's going to be a little choppy in terms of based on the government regulations. There's got to be some clear winners and there's going to be some losers, right. ","And we're trying to make sure we focus on partnering with the winners who've got the deep pockets technical knowhow that we can support.","So and for us, that's much better content than on our ICE business. And so our real focus right now is the build like I said, build the foundation that starts with we have the right engineers. We have one of the best technical centers in the world for electrification in our Kokomo site.","We have the right people, we have the right test equipment, we can do all the vehicle tests. We're now expanding that into other places in China, Singapore and over here in Europe. So we're building the network for engineering. Second, we've already covered a few times we're building the manufacturing footprint we need. We have book of business right now. We're already starting to think about. We are actually in the future two or three years out we are going to need another plant. We're not sure yet, we'll assess that.","Okay, so it's going to come as I said before I have a Tesla sit in my house back in Indiana. I love it, all right. So got to become more affordable though to be it the high volumes. And the other thing, I've learned in the last 90 days is that China has made a decision at the highest levels to be the leaders in electrification followed by Europeans, by regulations. North American guys are kind of laggards right now to be quite honest. And when I met with those customers, they're a little behind what I've met with in China and Europe. How is that?","Noah Kaye","Yes, I agree. If I could just ask one more. Rick this is great color on kind of your orientation finding, so far. We didn't expect that kind of an updated medium term profitability target this quarter but it sounds like you're getting down the road here. So when the reasonable timeframe to kind of hearing update is this the July call, what would make sense?","Rick Dauch","Yes, I think we've got a lot of hard work to do. We just gave our board an update of some of my initial findings with the team just last week. We gave them some kind of directional things we think we're going to dig into. They gave us clear direction. Go to your analytical work, come back to us. Let's talk about costs where you can save money, where you need to spend money and so I think we'll have a very frank discussion with the board in July and I think as we make decisions we'll be able come out probably the piecemeal fashion.","I'll tell you we're going to have some decisions by July for sure on org structure and where we think we get a lot of that will be determined by are we still on track for our TSA. I think we will be. Are we on track on GDI? I think we'll be on schedule. Are we on track at E&E, we are on schedule, there's no reason to think we're not going to be. So we're kind of balancing and juggling lot of balls right now is what I'd say.","But I would say this too, one thing for sure, I confirmed this company long before I got here set itself forward on a strategic path in a product portfolio. And they are directionally correct. We may make a few degree changes but we're not making any wholesale changes. We're not in the business of going out and doing some big M&A deals right now.","We're going to fix what we have. Stand this company up, get it back to the profitability levels, we think it can get to, generate the cash and then we can be a much bigger player, if we need to in the future. Does that help?","Noah Kaye","It does, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is open.","Brian Johnson","Yes. I've got some questions on the cadence but I'll set those for later on with IR. My question to you is understand in detail your improvement plan for GDI and the close weekly operational monitoring you're having. I understand as well the TSA and the cost reduction, all of those echo the famous prayer kind of things that you can control. Haven't heard as much on China. And are you kind of saying that you're taking some serenity around the things, you can't control. Do Chinese production volumes in cuts or rates. But frankly, I'd be surprised that there aren't more aggressive either plant level issues, customer recovery issues, cost reduction whatever that can help offset some of that pressure given the \u2013 given where you are in the market tell that significant underperformance on the revenue side in an already weak market.","Rick Dauch","I\u2019ll start with GDI. I thank you, for you heard our message loud and clear. There's nothing I see at any of the GDI plants or at our supplier plants that can\u2019t be fix with the right time and the right resources.","What I do think and I am pretty strong in this opinion is that we are off-track on GDI about two years ago, because we have launch properly in terms of design being done on time, decisions being done on time, forcing of equipment and tooling being done on time and what you get then is a plant that\u2019s not quite ready to launch and then you got exacerbated because the customers were, oh my gosh, we got switch from diesel gasoline and who want even more.","So we think we launch correctly. Now we don\u2019t worry about that. So that one has to fix and we will do that and I\u2019ve told the team under my watch we won't have late launches. We will do things on time, starting with engineering, sourcing, tracking equipment, stall equipment and then running hell out of the business and so when I say deep into the shores on how we\u2019re going to make that business better and faster.","In China you are right, I\u2019ve got to go back and dig \u2013 I\u2019ve got to - it took me all 10 days to figure out go and see all the customers there, right. So we have some work to do there. I think we\u2019re underrepresented in Asia on the CV side of the business, that\u2019s an opportunity for us. That\u2019s the largest CV market in the world.","One of our competitors has a near monopoly in a couple of areas and some of our customers who like us to come there. So there\u2019s an opportunity. I got to dig in a little bit more with the sales team and engineering team on the customers on where we are winning, where we are losing.","So you got three or four big winners there. VW, GM Shanghai, GLE and couple of others. We got to make sure we\u2019re winning our fair share and what can we do there. So that\u2019s kind of where we are right now. Give me another 90 to 120 days, and I\u2019ll be back to China and I\u2019ll be able to dig a little deeper. Thanks. Anything you want to say.","Vivid Sehgal","I think just Brian the only thing I would add is for the second half of the year. I mean for full year China we called the market down. We take appropriately about minus 8 so its production volumes. We are not assuming any stimulus that comes during the second half right now.","So how tightens [inaudible] I mean, you know we are cautious, we\u2019re looking at inventory levels right now making sure that one of the VIP changes is creating any sort of inventory disbalance like we saw last year, but our second half performance doesn't rely on a great market uptake or finish stimulus program right now.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","And just to follow on, my understanding is you were overly exposed to the smaller locals who had been the global expertise [inaudible]. Is the falloff in their market share and interest sales were then implied that there is a cost reduction opportunity at the factory level, consolidated factory. So is there some way to offset what you can control that is your end customers sales through actions in China?","Rick Dauch","We have four large plants in China, right. One is brand-new Suzhou and its launching that 100% pure electrification, you will see the plan quintuple in sales over the next four or five years, so that's going to be one of our fast growing plants.","We have two fuel injection plants, one for automotive, one for medium duty. Both plans are pretty good, layouts are good, equipment is good, people are good. We\u2019re going to go back and drilldown the margins are okay with just volumes are down across fixed assets and there is not. These are two separate plants in two different regions, you don't consolidate them there. We got to go basically filled up those plants up and that capacity up.","The fourth plant is actually a joint venture, got some of our non-fuel injection system programs there. That plant is running at 55% to 60% capacity right now and so that's one of the plants that drag us down a little bit. There\u2019s an opportunity to reduce to go fill some of that capacity up. Let\u2019s go find the customers and what price we make money doing that.","And the second thing is we have two large technical centers one in Beijing and one in Shanghai. We have to take a look at some of the cost structures that, right. So that\u2019s the area we\u2019re probably going to take a look at.","So first is to grow with the olden capacity, we haven\u2019t meet our competitors and profitable. Two, make sure that launch of the E&E plants there and three, we have to do some cost structure changes there. Does that help?","Operator","And our final question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Denis on for Emmanuel. Just two questions. First on the on the bookings and apologies for the misses earlier. Can you provide any sort of breakdown kind of shaped up during the quarter?","Vivid Sehgal","The bookings are really in line with our expectations. We are pretty pleased with where they are going because I mean, sort of the main areas of our focus. So as Rick said, we had a pretty large follow-on in commercial vehicle which is certainly a momentum for us. It's a four-year extension to a program in heavy-duty right now.","We had a are very important way in the European customer in GDI, which is going to provide us with some very strong momentum going forward and also equally importance a very material area in power electronics within the HV battery management system, which is also a very important driver in terms of our cadence.","So we\u2019re exactly on track and I think what you\u2019re going to see for the rest of the year is a continuation in our bookings momentum. So geographically very diversified and three categories across the organization at this stage. So we\u2019re in pretty good terms right now.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","Do you have a number like a breakdown for the power electronics portion or the electronics portion?","Vivid Sehgal","We don\u2019t really give that I mean I think if you look at it pretty relatively we talked about sort of 1.6 billion. Power electronics was a - let me [inaudible] it\u2019s a material number within that.","Rick Dauch","I think last year it was 50-50 power electronics.","Vivid Sehgal","I think you\u2019ve been looking at it right now with commercial vehicle. There are relatively equal important this quarter, yes.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","And on the margin, so appreciate the disclosure about the 200 to 250 basis points from the Delphi initiatives, is there any way you can kind of breakdown the split among the various pieces of that. For example, the TSAs versus kind of the more manufacturing efficiencies?","Vivid Sehgal","Yes, certainly. Let me give it to you maybe magnitude. I won\u2019t sort of give you the full number range but let me give you in the size buckets. By far the biggest element that is our own cost control.","Number one, it is the cost control that is coming from the phasing of our engineering which is very heavily frontloaded into H1 and the spin related cost. So cost control, which we\u2019ve spoken about and is a big focus of Rick and myself right now is going to be the number one driver.","And we\u2019re already seeing improvements that are beginning to happen in Q2 and will see that continue for the rest of this year that is fully within our control. The second and part of that one is manufacturing a material performance. We have a cadence that we do see in the second half of the year improvements in both of those and again we are seeing an improvement in Q2 and we\u2019re very confident. So that will be running through till the end of the year.","And those are really being offset by some incremental depreciation cost that we got but we feel we got those covered in relation to the cost savings and the operational improvements that we have from those site.","The smaller portion and I want to be clear on that is actually coming from the power electronics in GDI margin expansion areas. They are going to be important but they are going to be probably more important in 2020 than they are actually in the second half of 2019. So that\u2019s how we will bucket it. Cost control number one. Operational performance number two, margin expansion number three through our advanced technologies.","Operator","I am showing no further questions at this time. I want to now like to turn the call back over to Rick Dauch, Chief Executive Officer for Delphi Technologies.","Rick Dauch","Thanks. Well, appreciate everybody being on the call. I know you had a busy day with a couple of people reporting today. We appreciate your interest in Delphi Technologies and we will continue to go out and drive this business forward in the right direction and we will see out in the road or talk to you later this afternoon on some one-on-one call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Delphi\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the call over to Jack Monti, Delphi\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may now begin your conference.","Jack Monti","Thank you, Brandy, and thanks so much everyone for joining Delphi\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. Please see slide two for disclosure on forward-looking statements, which we will be making on today\u2019s call, and only reflect Delphi\u2019s current view of future financial performance, which may be materially different from our actual performance.","Joining today\u2019s call will be Rodney O\u2019Neal, Delphi\u2019s CEO and President and Kevin Clark, our CFO.","And see on slide three, Rod O\u2019Neal begin the call with an overview 2012 and our 2013 priorities, followed by Kevin Clark who will review our financial performance in greater detail, and provide 2013 in first quarter guidance. After Rod\u2019s closing remarks, we\u2019ll open the line for Q&A.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Rod.","Rodney O'Neal","","Thanks, Jack and good morning everyone and I appreciate you joining us as we close out our 2012 year and talk about our priorities for this year. Even with the challenging environment in Europe, we had a very solid quarter in Q4, that was consistent with our previous guidance reflects the cost structure and we implemented several restructuring initiatives primarily in Europe, and we continued to rotate our footprint to lower cost countries.","Our performance is a testament to our management team that is laser focused for operational execution and increasing shareholder value. Delphi has a lot to be excited about we are going to continue to stay focused on providing solutions for our customers\u2019 challenges.","So let\u2019s move into the presentation, and go to slide 5. overall 2012 was a great year for Delphi, while our revenue was relatively flat as a result of a soft market in Europe in the effect of foreign exchange.","EBITDA margins increased to 13.8% in earnings per share grew a robust 38%. Our credit ratings were increased to just under investment grade. We were added to the S&P 500 which is a real knock to the confidence we generated in the marketplace, and throughout 2012 we continue to reduce our industry leading cost structure, which positions us well to meet the challenges in 2013.","And as I\u2019ve already mentioned we implemented several restructuring initiatives as we continue to rotate our footprint, optimize our cost structure, proactively address the soft market. Now at the same time, we\u2019re continuing to invest these strategic growth initiatives. As an example, we completed acquisition of MVL last quarter, it significantly enhances our position in automotive connectors market, we expand about the progress we\u2019ve made in integrating this company into Delphi.","We also expanded our footprint into China, I\u2019ll discuss that in the minute. We also continue to invest in our Safe, Green and Connected product portfolio. That all of these things have us well positioned for top and bottom line expansion 2013 have begun.","Let\u2019s go slide six, in April I\u2019m going to be in China at the Shanghai Show to meet our customers, our partners, and my management team. And I could tell you that we are more excited endeavor up opportunities in the world\u2019s largest automotive market. In 2012, we opened three new plants in China, in order to keep up with increase demand.","We have additional expansion plan for 2013 including opening up a diesel fuel injection plant in Yantai in the fourth quarter to serve the commercial vehicle market. In this past quarter, we completed the expansion of our Beijing operations to handle increase demand, gas fuel injection systems, then we will continue to significantly out growth the underlying market in this high growth region. We are on track to double the size of our China business over the next four to five years.","So let\u2019s move into the technology, let\u2019s go to slide seven, I said before about what our mission is, and we\u2019re focused on solving our customers\u2019 problems, that\u2019s our value problem. And we invest $1.5 billion in gross engineering last year to focus on the mega trends of Safe, Green and Connected, that\u2019s really starting to pay off.","Our gasoline direct injection technology has really taken a hold in the marketplace with the solution for better fuel economy. Our diesel products are getting a great reception as the customer to begin the oil business that helps them supply with the more stricter Euro 7 standards. We\u2019re investing in China because we know that region will soon be the largest medium in heavy duty diesel market in the world.","In the area back to safety, in our MyFi products; we book $1.5 billion in new business last year in this arena, and with the acquisition of MVL we now have all the connectors to optimize an entire architecture.","So let\u2019s move to slide eight; we will be expanding our Silicon Valley technology center in Q1 to better position us to elaborate with our technology partners. There is more of electronic content enters into the vehicle. Our partners there will help us remain at the forefront of this area","Let\u2019s go slide nine, be an example how we\u2019re leading the way technology; in last month Consumer Electronic show, we\u2019ll built our capability in the connected vehicle space a collaboration with Verizon.","This unique device allows drivers to use their smartphones to lock or unlock their car, track their car\u2019s location, and how it\u2019s been driven. Maybe in the failure of these vehicle systems, problems they\u2019re working hard. Our innovation received at a distorted work from popular mechanics at CES, we\u2019ve already heard from other mobile phone carriers in Europe and in the U.S. who are very interested in the concept.","Let\u2019s go to slide 10. We continue to receive active rights for our customers across the globe for exceeding their expectations of quality, delivery and launch. If you look the chart, you\u2019ll see several customers who have given us the words in the last year. And this continued validation, both our advanced technologies and our operational excellence, which is key to our top line expansion are going to cover now.","Let\u2019s go to slide 11. In 2012, we set a new record with $26 billion of new business book, and over the last 12 quarters, we\u2019ve generated almost $70 billion in book. And in Q4, we booked only $6 million in new business, including some rising Chinese OEMs like JAC with one of those that have diesel fuel injection system contract, and from our second largest customer VW for electrical systems.","And you can see from the slide that we continue to increase the geographical diversification of our business. 2012 Asia represented 34% of our new business books, these numbers validate by higher sole optimistic about Delphi\u2019s future.","Let\u2019s go to slide 12. Now although my management team and I are proud of accomplishments in the 2012, we understand that our stakeholders want to know what\u2019s next? Dealing with expected challenges in Europe in 2013, we know our continued focus on outstanding operating execution keep us on track for strong results and allow us to increase shareholder value. We will accelerate the continued rotation of our footprint to lower cost structures. we will continue to integrate MVL and deliver on the primary synergies. We will achieve disciplined revenue growth and further expand margins and earnings per share and we will increase cash flow. And we will continue to deploy capital in a very disciplined manner on our growth, our acquisitions and return cash to shareholders. So to sum it up, we will continue to be focused on creating value operating value to our shareholders. We did in our first year as a public company. We will continue to work hard to do so in 2013.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin who will cover the numbers.","Kevin P. Clark","Thanks, Rod. Good morning everyone. I will begin by covering our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 results, then provide 2013 guidance and lastly wrap up with our net new business outlook for the 2013 through 2015 period. In the third quarter, we announced we\u2019re implementing proactive restructuring initiatives, principally related to the streamlining of our European cost structure as well as the integration of the MVL acquisition.","In order to provide a clear view to the underlying fundamentals of the business, today\u2019s discussion will exclude all restructuring and other non-recurring costs. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results are included in the back of both the press releases and this presentation for your reference.","So let me start on slide 14 with a snapshot of our fourth quarter results, which as Rod already mentioned, we\u2019re in line with our expectation. In a challenging environment, we delivered solid EBITDA margins, earnings per share and free cash flow, revenue totaled $3.8 billion and it's down 4% after adjusting for FX, commodities, acquisitions, divestitures. Continued weakness in Western European production, which was down roughly 15% during the quarter, proved to be a significant headwind across each of our segments, resulting in an 18% decline in total European revenues. As a result of our lean cost structure and strong operating execution, we maintained double-digit EBITDA margins in Europe and delivered consolidated margins of just under 13%. Net income totaled $287 million and earnings per share was $0.90.","Lastly, we generated free cash flow of $185 million that was net of $200 million payment related to 2010 long-term incentive plan, which was made at the end of the quarter.","So with that as a backdrop, let's move to slide 15. I'll review fourth-quarter revenue in more detail. Reported revenue declined 3.4% and just under $3.8 billion, volume declined $110 million or 3%. Foreign exchange and commodity prices created a 2 point headwind growth. Price down for 1.6% at the low end of our expected range of 1.5% to 2%. And acquisitions net of divestitures added $127 million to revenue, providing a 3 point tailwind to growth. On a regional basis as I mentioned European revenues were down 18% as a result of continued reproduction volumes of both the light vehicle and commercial vehicle segments.","Asia continue to be our fastest growing region, revenues increased 11% significantly over market, within that region China revenues increased 10%, 6 points above market, revenues in North America increased 6% reflecting our specific customer mix, our limited exposure in the Japanese transplants and continued weakness in the automotive aftermarket. in our smallest region, South America, revenues increased 4%, an improvement versus prior quarters are below market due to customer platform mix.","Slide 16, reconciles the year-over-year change in EBITDA. Before I get into the numbers, you may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2011, favorable mix and exceptional operating performance principally in our powertrain business which actually had over 18% margins in that quarter translated into very strong consolidated results, making year-over-year comparisons pretty challenging.","For the quarter, EBITDA totaled $486 million reflecting a negative effect of price down, flow-through and lower revenue, combined with unfavorable mix. Foreigner exchange in the mark-to-market accounting associated with the prior long-term incentive plans. Our operating performance net of all economics and excluding the benefit of the MVL acquisition more than offset the effect of price tax. EBITDA margins declined to 12.9%, adjusting for accounting associated with prior long-term incentive plan, EBITDA margins actually totaled 13.2%.","Now slide 17 includes our segment results. our Electrical Architecture\u2019s revenue increased just under 3%, excluding the impact of the MVL acquisition driven by very strong growth in North America is up actually 20%, the result of a number of new program launches, and strong growth in South America and Asia, partially offset by a 17% decline in European revenues.","Segment EBITDA totaled $231 million representing a 13.1% EBITDA margin, which is up 200 basis points from the prior year. Revenue in our Powertrain segment was down almost 13% reflecting a 20% decline in European revenues, and lower revenues in North America primarily the result of continued weakness in the automotive after-market as well as lower revenues South America through platform mix, partially offset by strong revenue growth in Asia.","Segment EBITDA margins declined 400 basis points to 14%, the result of difficult comparison to the prior period that I mentioned previously, lower volumes and a lower mix of diesel fuel injection systems in Europe.","In our Electronics and Safety segment revenue declined 5% primarily the result of just over 13% decline in European revenues, and the 3% decline in North America partially offset by very strong revenue growth in Asia. Segment EBITDA margins improve 50 basis points to 14% as a result of the rotation of our lower margin business in our mechatronic and receiver product lines.","Thermal segment revenues declined almost 6% primarily the result of 20% decline in European revenues, and flat revenue growth in North America partially offset by single-digit growth in Asia and South America, EBITDA declined to $16 million.","Turning to slide 18, earnings per share totaled $0.90 reflecting lower volume in the accounting associated with the prior long-term incentive plan partially offset by the benefit of the MVL acquisition, a $0.05 benefit from a lower tax rate and share buyback, and in a $0.11 benefit from our reduction in other expenses primarily related to the 2011 IPO.","Moving to slide 19, the highlight of full year results we deliver solid EBITDA margin expansion in earnings growth. Revenue totaled $15.5 billion, a reduction of 2.3%. EBITDA totaled $2.142 billion and EBITDA margins increased to 13.8%.","Net income increase 6.1% to $1.24 billion and earnings per share totaled $3.84, an increase of 38% over the prior year. Free cash flow totaled $827 million and with that as a background, let\u2019s move to slide 20 to review full year revenue growth in more detail.","As I mentioned, reported revenue declined 3.3% to a little over $15.5 billion. FX and commodity price had about a $700 million negative impact on revenue resulting in a four point headwind to our growth rate.","Price downs for a 1.7% inline with our expectations. Acquisition, net of divestitures totaled $110 million, a one point of growth and sales volumes totaled $339 million adding two points to our growth rate. Excluding FX and commodity prices as well acquisition submitted divestitures, revenues were up slightly to 0.4%. On a regional basis, revenues were weakest in Europe and South America. Both were down roughly 6%. Revenues in North America and Asia increased 6% and 11% respectively. In china revenue growth totaled, seven points over the annoying market.","Slide 21 underscores our ability to leverage of cost structure. EBITDA totaled $2.142 billion for the year negatively impacted by price down, foreign exchange mix in the accounting associated with our prior long-term incentive program. These headwinds were partially offset by record operating performance, flow to end volume growth and the impact of the MVL acquisition. EBITDA margins expanded 40 basis points to 13.8% and excluding the impact of the long-term incentive plan, EBITDA margins actually increased 80 basis points to 14.2%.","Slide 22, includes our segment financial results. Electrical architectures revenues increased over 5% driven by continued strong growth in North America and Asia, partially offset by declines in both Europe and South America. Segment EBITDA increased to $945 million. EBITDA margins expanded 13.9%.","Powertrain segment revenue was down just over 2%, result of a reduction of revenues in North America, South America and Europe, partially offset by very strong growth in Asia. Despite the lower revenues, EBITDA margins increased by 100 basis points to 15.5%, partially the result of lower warranty cost during the period. Revenue in our electronic and safety segment declined just over 3% primarily the result of a decline in European revenues, partially offset by a moderate growth in North America and Asia.","Overall, improved business mix and operating performance increased EBITDA margin by 50 basis points to 13.3%. Thermal segment revenues declined a little under 5%, primarily the result of significant revenue declines in Europe and South America. EBITDA declined to $111 million and EBITDA margins contracted 7.2%.","Turning to slide 23, earnings per share increased from a pro forma $3.57 per-share to $3.84 per share, the result of share buybacks, EBITDA growth, a lower tax rate and lower other expense, partially offset by accounting associated with the prior long-term incentive plan. Excluding the effect of the accounting for the long-term incentive plan, earnings per share increased 13% over the prior year\u2019s pro forma amount.","Moving to cash flow on slide 24, we continue doing excellent job converting earnings into cash flow, strong EBITDA more than offset capital spending, cash interest taxes as well as restructuring expense. We generated $827 million in cash for financing which was used to repurchase over 400 million of stock and fund a portion of the purchase price for the MVL acquisition. Free cash flow as a percent of net income increased to almost 80% excluding the $200 million one-time payment for the long-term incentive plan at year-end.","Moving on to slide 25, we ended the year with a very solid balance sheet that reflected investment grade credit metrics providing us with multiple leverage to drive shareholder value. Cash on hand was over $1.1 billion and net debt was just under $1.4 billion, roughly 0.6 times EBITDA. liquidity totaled almost $2.4 billion providing significant financial flexibility and as you can see, we\u2019ve no meaningful debt maturities until 2016.","Moving to slide 26 to review some of the assumptions underlying our 2013 guidance, based on several sources including customer schedules and IHS, we are forecasting a 1% increase in global production which basically represents flat year-over-year volume growth in production on a Delphi weighted market basis. Our forecasts in European production declined 4% for the full year with the first quarter expected to be down 15%, roughly flat on a sequential quarterly basis, and then beginning to stabilize and improve slightly during the back half of the year.","Turning to slide 27 to discuss our 2013 guidance, which excludes all the restructuring integration and other one-time items, we currently expect full-year revenue to be in the range of $16.2 billion to $16.6 billion. EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $2.325 billion to $2.425 billion, reflecting tailwinds from the MVL acquisition and accounting for the long-term incentive plan as well as the impact of 4:1 volume and the effect of mix.","EBITDA margins will be in the range of 14.4% to 14.6%. 2013 depreciation and amortization will increase to $600 million or 3.7% of revenues at the midpoint of our guidance range, reflecting the inclusion of MVL, which has roughly $70 million to depreciation and the amortization. And depreciation in new fixed assets, which adds an additional $60 million of depreciation to our 2012 full-year depreciation and amortization amount of $470 million.","We expect tax rate, 16% for the year, earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $4.12 to $4.38 and is based on a share count of $317 million representing 11% EPS growth at the midpoint of our guidance range. Cash flow before financing will be $1 billion with capital expenditures of roughly $750 million, providing us with significant flexibility to increase shareholder value through the continued disciplined deployment of capital.","Turning to the first quarter; our outlook for the first quarter of 2013 is largely consistent with the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect global industry volumes to decrease 6% with European production declining 13% on a year-over-year basis.","We expect revenues to be in the range of $3.9 billion to $4 billion. EBITDA will be in the range of $515 million to $540 million, representing EBITDA margins of 13.2% to 13.5%. EPS will be in the range of $0.93 to $1 and assumes $317 million shares outstanding and the 10% effective tax rate.","Cash flow generation will reflect the impact of cash spending from the restructuring as well as normal seasonality that was reflected in our 2012 cash flows. As Rod mentioned, we continue to have tremendous momentum in our bookings, the 2012 amount of over $26 billion represents a significant increase over last year\u2019s record amount. It is reflected in the $400 million increase in net new business for the three-year period.","Slide 28 provides you with an update to our net new business, which totaled $3.2 billion for 2013 through 2015 versus the $2.8 billion for the 2012 through 2014 period that we reported previously. Net new business in 2013 is forecasted to be $0.5 billion, down from last year\u2019s estimate, reflecting lower underlying industry volumes, principally in Europe and South America to lay in select programs such as the launch of electric and hybrid vehicles primarily in the North American market, lower high-content option take rates, and the negative effect of foreign exchange and commodity prices.","Net new business in 2014 is expected to be $1.1 billion that\u2019s up slightly from our prior estimates. the increase is the result of the previously mentioned retaining of select programs and increased volumes in North America and China, partially offset by lower high content option take rates, and the negative effect of foreign exchange and commodity prices.","We expect net new business in 2015 to total $1.6 billion, the result of the recent record level of recent new business bookings. Our mix of net new business is significantly weighted towards Asia, given the region\u2019s relative growth and in North America where we made strive to continue to diversify our customer base.","So with that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Rod.","Rodney O\u2019Neal","Thanks, Kevin. And before we move into the Q&A, I just want to remind everyone about the solid results the team achieved in 2012 despite the macroeconomic headwinds. And as always, we remain focused on outstanding execution where we\u2019re above disciplined investments and our growth initiatives with actions to further reduce our cost structure.","So looking forward, given in a challenging European environment, we are well-positioned for a solid margin expansion in earnings per share growth. And we absolutely remain committed to achieve in our long-term objectives for the business and increasing shareholder value.","So operator, we\u2019ll open it up now for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","Good morning to you.","Rodney O\u2019Neal","Good morning, Brian.","Brian A. Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","Just want to explore a couple of margin outliers, just to make sure, we understand the underlying run rate. Just first on the positive side, electronics and safety, you\u2019ve had what looks to me to be a near two-year lowering revenue, you had a record margin number. what line on there? And then on the good side and then can we think about that going forward? And then second sort of be opposite is a year ago, powertrain had a very high 18%, we had hindsight was there that hasn\u2019t been there in subsequent quarters and how should we think about that segment going forward?","Rodney O'Neal","E&S as I said in my statements, Brian, from a year-over-year standpoint like all of our businesses; we\u2019re certainly affected by revenue or a weak market in Europe. so that\u2019s the largest explanation as it relates to change in year-over-year revenue growth. As it relates to margin expansion, our unit business has done an exceptional job of putting together performance initiatives where they\u2019ve offset, more than offset economics, one. And then two, we\u2019ve talked about over the last few quarterly conference calls; our initiative to rotate our business out of some lower margin, mechatronic computer product lines and that is paying benefits.","On a go-forward basis, for the full year, we\u2019d expect our E&S business to expand margins on a year-over-year basis. I\u2019d tell you there will be some volatility when you look at it sequentially, because it\u2019s a business where reimbursement for certain engineering activities where we partner with our customers, it\u2019s not evenly allocated across each quarter of a calendar year. So that will be my explanation on E&S.","As it relates to powertrain, if you recall in the fourth quarter of last year, our powertrain business truly operated at an optimal level. They had 18% EBITDA margins. Revenue growth was extremely strong. Our product mix was significantly weighted towards diesel fuel injection systems and they had very solid operating performance. And I think we told people at that point in time that they should not assume that the business operates on a go forward basis at that sort of level.","So I would start with the product for your comp. As it relates to this quarter, our Powertrain business obviously was significantly affected by what\u2019s going on in Europe. Our Eagle business is a little low for half of our total Powertrain business and as result it was affected by the European downturn from a volume standpoint, one. And then two, consistent with what we talked about in the third quarter, on the third quarter call we saw slight deterioration in mix in terms of diesel fuel injection systems in Europe in the fourth quarter for our Powertrain business. So that\u2019s how I\u2019ll explain the two periods.","Brian A. Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","And then on the Indian assets, is there a difference between electronics, safety possibility or is it just \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a bit variable given \u2013 and you discussed, the software model that\u2019s evolving and getting paid up front some of the engineering?","Rodney O\u2019Neal","Yeah. I mean getting paid for the engineering is something that we\u2019ve done consistently in the past. It\u2019s very lumpy in terms of payments. I think it\u2019s really a mix of two things. It\u2019s a mix of more software business which is higher margin that tends to be in the safety arena. And we\u2019ve been talking about the rotation of some of that lower margin business.","Brian A. Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from line Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Couple of questions; first, the new business backlog declined from $900 million or so this year to $500 million and it seems like that\u2019s more than would be explained by production. And I believe that your 2014 increase was only about $100 million. So it seems like that wouldn't be fully explained by the push out as well. Can you give us a little bit more on what was behind that?","Rodney O'Neal","Sure, it's really a couple of things at the end of the day, Rod. It\u2019s a mix of volume reduction which is industry volume reduction primarily in South America and in European. Mix change, so we've seen or assuming lower take rates on some of the higher content options principally in the area of electronics and safety. It\u2019s the push out of electrical vehicles where we had a fairly significant growth in our prior guidance. Those are the largest changes.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And I was hoping you can maybe flesh out a little more on this earnings bridge till 2013. If we use the midpoint of your guidance, you\u2019re showing EBITDA increasing by about $233 million. I think you\u2019ve previously said that the decline in variable comp or that stock comp expenses like $90 million; so the underlying performance would be like $143 million if you subtracted that. And MVL based on what you\u2019ve said previously about EBITDA margins, I would think as maybe a $110 million. So underlying that might be something like $33 billion of EBITDA improvement. And is that reasonable expectation and then on the revenue side, I\u2019m assuming that we would subtract maybe $670 million related to MVL, so about $230 million of revenue growth?","Rodney O'Neal","Yeah. So let me touch on, I understand what you\u2019re trying to get to. So why don\u2019t I take a shot at it. It\u2019s really, well let me start with, we would recommend based on where we see industry binds the turn of the market as people look at earnings, they really look at earnings on a sequential basis versus a year-over-year basis. so from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, we think it actually is a better comp to come off of.","So I would start with that sitting in your shoes. second, as you look at those tailwinds, there are two, there is the long-term incentive comp plan, you\u2019re right if it goes away that tailwind of $80 million on an EBITDA basis, and there is a benefit of the MVL acquisition, which really has broken down to pieces, $100 million to $110 million of base MVL, and then roughly $30 million or $50 million of synergies associated with the MVL. So we call it year-over-year roughly, $150 million coming from MVL. So that\u2019s those are the two pieces. three, you get volume growth, year-over-year and on a year-over-year basis that volume growth is we\u2019re assuming partially offset by mix.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. So based on that bridge, the underlying performance is pretty neutral on the year-over-year basis?","Rodney O'Neal","I\u2019d say it\u2019s up slightly.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then lastly, normally for Delphi and I think most suppliers, the profitability is typically stronger in the first half than the second half because of production days.","Rodney O'Neal","Right.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And your guidance implies a pretty meaningful uptick, could you just tell us broadly what you are expecting will happen sequentially like from the first half to the second half? Is there a drag that moderates maybe in Thermal or in some other areas?","Rodney O'Neal","Yeah, that\u2019s a great question. You are right. In this where you would typically see from a unit production standpoint of a 51-49 mix first half versus second half. As we look at 2013, we believe it\u2019s going to be closer to 49-51, 50-50, somewhere in that range. Where you will see the improvement is a slight improvement in sequential volumes in Europe, but fairly slight strong improvements on a sequential basis in China and some improvements although not significant on a sequential basis in North America.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","This is just an unusual timing of production I guess is what you are saying?","Rodney O'Neal","Relative to historical trends, it would be less typical, yes.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe just a kind of follow up on the [Katon\u2019s] question, Kevin, would the synergies from MVL be more back half loaded, it might skewed the earnings through the course of the year?","Rodney O'Neal","Yes as you look at and I should have touched on that, if you look at the revenue and earnings through the back half of the year, in addition industry volumes a couple of things happened; one as it relates to new business win, they tend to come in at the back half of the year versus the front half. Two, you get the benefit of the MVL synergies which I mentioned are roughly $15 million, they are back half, they are back-end loaded, as well as restructuring benefits of $30 million, I\u2019ve talked to you folks about previously.","Then again as I mentioned you get an uptick in industry volumes, we say you were to take the first quarter and analyze it, and compared that to the back half of the year throughout that three months period, you should see roughly a 3% to 4% increase in industry volumes. Again the biggest piece in China was some improvement, although small in Europe. And then we have performance which is just come on in the back half of the year.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay that's very helpful. The other clarification on the outlook, buybacks are not included in your EPS forecast is that correct?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes that is correct as I stated and Rod stated we're confident, we will generate a lot of cash flow in 2013 that we can use to drive shareholder value in a number of different ways, and we are purchasing fair amount of stock in 2012 that could be an option in 2013, but we've talked about in the past that I\u2019d also look at accretive acquisitions and acquisitions in expanded margins, so that\u2019s best to provide guidance to you folks without any assumptions as it relates to share repurchases timing of share repurchases or timing of share repurchases.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's helpful. Then if you look at slide 28, I know there is some tugging and pushing between 2013 and 2014, based on the stuff you\u2019ve talked about, but the idea that 2015 is a much higher net new business backlog number than the two previous years is somewhat unusual and shows that you have some pretty strong growth. I\u2019m just curious as you talk to your customers, is this really a function of you continuing to win more net new business, because you\u2019ve gotten further away from bankruptcy and they\u2019re including you much more in the coding process or is this really just a function of the content that you\u2019re seeing growing, I am just trying to figure out those two factors and how much they\u2019re waiting in this number, because it\u2019s unusual that your backlog will be so much higher in the third year?","Rodney O'Neal","Well, it\u2019s not the bankruptcy issue; it\u2019s actually the rotation of momentum that we have. And then as you recall, if you go back to, when we started the journey in Ohio, we were very centric here in North America, very centric to [Wisconsin]. And now, obviously we\u2019re much more diversified geographic of customer base. and now, we enter the second, maybe, even the third contracts with the new customers that we did not have experienced with before and to be quite honest, they\u2019ve been quite pleased with our performance. and so what you\u2019re seeing is, what we said would occur with this balance this year that we were going to seek as we began to not turning back to North America and Europe, but begin to grow Asia and you see the bookings.","So this is the pace of movement particularly in China, which I think we would all agree is, probably not on an emerging market anymore, it is a large market when you look at 20 million units, going to 30 million over the next few years.","So with China as the corner stone of our Asia store we\u2019re just getting round point of market that as big as robust, and all you are just seeing is the model that work as we describe is, it\u2019s beautiful thing.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So Rod when we usually look at third year though we usually hear from a lot of companies that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity left three years out in that 2015 number, are you bidding on a lot of business in addition to what you are showing us here?","Rodney O'Neal","Yeah, we are. It depends on the business, because the powertrain, it takes a little longer than a couple of years to bring to market, but some of the electronics and those kind of things are faster. So it depends on the portfolio, powertrain would be a little bit more extended beyond that.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay and then just lastly on the China plans that you\u2019re building this year I mean all that stuff is still wholly-owned facilities, there's no JVs or anything like that, it's all accomplished in the Delphi umbrellas. Is that correct?","Rodney O'Neal","Basically the wholly-owned majority control, yes. Our half was consistent.","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you very much.","Rodney O'Neal","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Leiker with Baird.","Unidentified Analyst","This is John in line for David.","Kevin P. Clark","Hi, how you?","Unidentified Analyst","Good. Just staying with net new business number, is there a way to segment that between the four businesses or just say may be directionally if a particular segment is growing faster than the others?","Kevin P. Clark","I would say directionally you see stronger growth in the EMS and powertrain segments over the period. So we\u2019re not going to break it out specifically find it\u2026","Unidentified Analyst","And then when you look at your powertrain business, it seems like the fuel injection business has fairly strong growth rates, I\u2019m assuming a lot of that is the contribution from commercial vehicle. I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s the opportunity in China as you look at it, because that\u2019s obviously 1 million unit market that it looks like it\u2019s about to inflect. so what may be the dollar opportunity or how much of the overall four to five year plan to double your business in China, is commercial vehicle related?","Rodney O\u2019Neal","I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to break that out of this phone call, but the mere fact that I\u2019m going to sink capital on the ground and you know how judicious we are in capital, and put up a new facility in the debt markets, that\u2019s what we think of it. But we\u2019re not going to signal to the competitors exactly where this revolver will do, it\u2019s very well set space that we think we\u2019re going to have significant opportunity. We could talk more about it later on, but we won\u2019t today.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And my last one, is the suppliers that are giving three-year backlog numbers are kind of in a difficult position right now, because we\u2019re basically a quarter or two into seeing kind of the high-content take rates turning down where so far the cycle before the last quarter to that dynamic have been pretty favorable. So I\u2019m just wondering when you look at this three-year backlog, what sort of magnitude is around kind of the take rate assumption laying down the overall growth numbers, and how does that flip around as we maybe get back to our earlier cycle take rate option?","Kevin P. Clark","Yeah. I guess way I would answer that question. Our assumption is as it relates to high-content take rates and the guidance for net new business that we\u2019re providing today are more conservative than our assumptions in the prior period of reflecting what we see more recently in terms of product mix. And I\u2019m not going to give a specific number.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks guys.","Rodney O'Neal","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Hey, good morning.","Kevin P. Clark","Good morning, Chris.","Rodney O'Neal","How are you?","Christopher J. Ceraso \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","So the bridge on EBITDA was helpful. I was hoping to come back to that briefly and just think about maybe some of the headwinds you have to overcome in addition to the tailwinds you talked about. two of them in particular, one, are you anticipating any headwind associated with the launch of the full-size GM truck? That\u2019s a pretty big program for you back at the envelope, probably something north of $1 billion in revenue, if our math is close. And you would expect that at least initially that would come on at lower margin than the current program that you\u2019re on.","So is that right and have you taken that into account and can you kind of ballpark what that is for us in terms of a headwind? And then secondly, what are you expecting terms of an increase in pension and health care expense from \u201812 to \u201813?","Rodney O'Neal","In terms of launches, Chris I mean, we always \u2013 they\u2019re in our numbers dealt by the perpetual launch. And so the numbers we give you, we have all that embedded in it, all right. So it\u2019s in the soft\u2026","Kevin P. Clark","Yeah Chris, I agree with Rod. He just said it\u2019s in our assumptions. So that\u2019s something that we watch. We watch very carefully obviously in our all over. As it relates to pension expense, we\u2019ll see pension expense on year-over-year basis go up about $20 million. As you know, we really don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have a U.S. pension program, you\u2019re defined benefit program. It really relates to a couple of small programs in Europe. So the increase in expense won\u2019t be significant.","I guess the other potential headwind quite frankly and it\u2019s on everybody\u2019s mind, is what happens with Europe, is it down 4% or potentially more. as you know, Europe is a meaningful market for us roughly every 1% reduction in industry volume in Europe for us is worth about $60 million of [revenue]. So that is something that we\u2019re watching very carefully and we\u2019ve implemented restructuring plans or in the process of implementing restructuring plans to reduce our footprint there and after they optimize cost structure, we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate price frankly whether we can do more and we\u2019ll keep you guys posted about that, but that is the other potential headwind out there that we\u2019re trying to stay in for us.","Christopher J. Ceraso \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","So that\u2019s helpful rules Kevin, so for each point $60 million revenues, what would we expect for the contribution on that with the decremental margin is at 25%, is that a good number at EBIT level?","Rodney O'Neal","At EBITDA level, I\u2019d see about 30%.","","Christopher J. Ceraso \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","30% at the EBITDA level.","Rodney O'Neal","35% depending on what new fuel injection mix looks like.","Christopher J. Ceraso \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Okay. and then just a follow-up on the tax situation, have you assessed the risk that maybe a tax reform here in the U.S. might jeopardize very well cooperative effective tax rate, understanding that cash taxes would not be affected, but can you take us through what\u2019s happening there and what you think might happen with the low tax rate on a go-forward basis?","Rodney O'Neal","Yeah. We\u2019re still highly confident in our position in the fact that not a U.S. entity, we\u2019re U.K. entity. It\u2019s just rolled on with the federal government, it just stayed on. I wish that\u2019s a more intelligent question.","Christopher J. Ceraso \u2013 Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citigroup.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Good morning.","Rodney O'Neal","Good morning.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Just wanted to go back to slide 28, the backlog. North America and Asia seem like they\u2019re up significantly versus the prior backlog. can you remind us what the margin contribution of those two regions, how that looks versus the corporate average and whether the shift in North America and Asia could continue to drive positive margins in the next couple of years?","Rodney O'Neal","We don\u2019t disclose that if we will say it\u2019s higher than our average, but we don\u2019t provide margin by region.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Okay. For both of those regions?","Rodney O'Neal","Both of those regions, the margins are higher than our average corporate margin, but again, we don\u2019t disclose specific margin rates by region.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","So that\u2019s helpful. And then just and I apologize if I missed this. Could you share what you\u2019re assuming for European light vehicle production in the first quarter and just how you\u2019re looking at your individual mix relative to perhaps the fourth quarter?","Rodney O'Neal","Sure. We are forecasting our European industry production to be down roughly 15%, and from a mix standpoint, we\u2019re presuming mix is pretty consistent with what we had in the fourth quarter of last year.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup Inc.","Last year. great, terrific, thanks so much guys.","Rodney O'Neal","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Aditya Oberoi with Goldman Sachs.","Aditya Oberoi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks a lot. One more housekeeping on the European production side. I think you guys just told about your assumption for the first quarter. what are you assuming for European production for the full year if you don\u2019t mind sharing?","Rodney O'Neal","Down 4%.","Aditya Oberoi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Got it. And the other question is on pricing and the European cost. do you think you guys are from a cost footprint standpoint you guys are sufficiently positioned to manage the down 4% or you guys need more flexing, and a related question any aggressive pricing you are seeing from competitors or OEM's requesting more price downs in Europe then your up.","Rodney O'Neal","In terms of our flexibility we\u2019ve always talked about the models that enable to flex proven to be true, and what we\u2019re doing is making it better, identify some of the restructuring initiatives that we talked about last quarter, the bulk of that was aimed at your just to increase flexibility as move forward. So we feel very comfortable our ability to have the 4% downtime so, in terms of pricing; our pricing is really 1.5% to 2% you saw it in numbers in Q4 by the line, and that\u2019s the way we see it going forward, so I can\u2019t speak for other suppliers, but we\u2019re maintaining that our pricing is going to be and that have range 1.5% to 2%.","Aditya Oberoi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Kevin P. Clark","And operator we only have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Matt Stover with Guggenheim.","Matt T. Stover \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Most of my questions have been asked on the restructuring front, can you give us a sense of the headcount impact to the $300 million, the cash, non-cash piece of that, and the timing of why you\u2019d expect for the cash piece of that fourth row.","Kevin P. Clark","Sure let me when I start with just the ground, we\u2019ve talked about previously, and where we are now Matt.","Matt T. Stover \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","Sure.","Kevin P. Clark","So previously we talked about $250 million for restructuring, $175 million in 2012, $75 million in 2013 with cash out leads that were basically $50 million \u2013 a $150 million \u2013 $50 million in '12, $150 million in '13 and the balancing in '14.","Now we're estimating $300 million in restructuring charges, $170 million booked in 2012, the balance in 2013. From a cash standpoint, $50 million was spent in \u201912. We\u2019d expect roughly $200 million to be spent in '13 with the balance of in 2014. As we mentioned, 2013 benefits, we\u2019re estimating roughly $70 million \u2013 $80 billion. That includes the MVL synergy savings in that number of $50 million. And then we would say it ramps up significantly in 2014 and beyond kind of 2 to 2.5 times of that 2013 savings numbers.","Matt T. Stover \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC","That's very helpful. One other follow-up question, as we look at the growth in your Chinese business, can you give us a sense of sort of the trends in the underlying profitability because if we look at some of the publically listed Chinese companies, we\u2019ve seen as the market has growing in deterioration margin, I'm just trying to think about, as we look for a big 9% growth in the volume next year, how you folks are incorporating the margins assumptions and your underlying guidance?","Rodney O\u2019Neal","","We don't spec it out that way.

With that I would like to turn it over to Rod.","Rod O'Neal","Thank you, Jessica. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. This our first time together as the new management team, since we announced the new organization. So I'm going to plough into the macro environments and provide an update on the recent business activity in my section and I have Kevin with me, who will discuss our strategy and priorities and we have Mark with us, who will follow up with our Q3 results as well as an update for our 2014 outlook.","So let's focus on the quarter, if you can go to Slide 5, please. So I will start out with our perspective on the current macro environment, which is played out marginally in line with what, we told our overall our view is that, this year's global vehicle production will increase roughly 3% just over 91 million units.","I expect the US economy to continue with this current path for the rest of the year, which should translate into approximately 5% growth, here in North America vehicle production. We continue to expect roughly 2% growth in Europe. And the macro environment in South America continues to be very difficult. We expect vehicle production through decline roughly 15% to 20% and as discussed last quarter. We have implemented very aggressive restructuring actions to reduce our footprint in this region.","We continue to see strength in China. We expect high single-digit growth rates and let's just move into the third our quarter highlights. It was another solid quarter, a record quarter in fact, revenue of 3% operating income of a robust 9%, OI margins expanded 60 basis points and EPS up 20%. In addition to two acquisitions, we returned almost $400 million to the shareholders, about $300 million in stock repurchases, $75 million in dividends.","We are confident in the outlook and our earnings outlook for 2014. As I told you in the past, we built an operating model that allows us to flex our cost structure to deliver on our margin, cash and EPS commitment and we continue to deliver in strategic imperatives that drive shareholder value.","Slide 6, as you may have read Delphi has formed a new Technology Advisory Council is part of our ongoing commitment to leading Delphi towards a safer, greener and more connected future. We have a panel of hand-picked prominent global technology thought leaders that will help Delphi produce product strategies and investments and technology to create growth for the enterprise and value to our shareholders.","The Council will also advice Delphi or our global mega trends, regional public policy and give us even more external touch points. Our initial meetings have proved very valuable in identifying further regulatory drive opportunities and leveraging partners for additional market penetration.

This accomplishment demonstrates our commitment to provide and lead customer solutions around safe, green and connected.","Slide 8, in addition to the numbers that Mark will talk about later. I think this chart is what it's all about, during the quarter we received three additional awards from our customers and this is validation of our ability to execute flawlessly as we continue to receive praise. If you look at the chart, you will see the awards, we have received from a very diverse group of customers that span the globe.","These awards underscore our technology and operational leadership in all areas of our product portfolio and with that, I will turn the call over to Kevin to cover few of our strategic items.","Kevin Clark","Thanks, Rod. Good morning, everyone. If you look at Slide 10 to pick up where Rod left off, we translate on our operating capabilities into strong financial results and increased shareholder returns and as you've heard me say before, we further drive shareholder value through a very balance and disciplined capital allocation plan.","So to put this in perspective for 2014 to 2016, we expect to generate roughly $7 million of operating cash flow, which will use to make organic investments in the business that accelerate revenue and earnings growth execute share buybacks, increase our dividend and complete strategic transactions that are accretive to value.","Moving to Slide 11, late in the third quarter. We announced two transactions. First we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Antaya Technologies which closed in early November. Antaya is a leading provider of proprietary on-glass connectors that further strengthen our high growth. Electrical connectors business and provide significant growth potential in China and in Europe.","Moving to Slide 12, second we also announced the acquisition of Unwired Technologies, which closed in early October. Unwired is a leading provider of infotainment connectivity modules which provides two-way data connections between smartphones, tablets and in-car infotainment systems allowing consumers to safely access content in their vehicle.","Unwired's product further strengthened our portfolio with high growth, media connectivity products. These two transactions are great strategic fit for Delphi. Further augmenting our connector product portfolio and we are confident that they will be accretive to value.","Moving to the next slide. In late September, early October Rod and I had the opportunity to spend time with our customers and technology partners at IAA Commercial Vehicle and Paris Motor Shows. These shows are great showcase for some of the most innovative products in the world and are really a great opportunity to hear from directly from our customers.","We came away from our customers meetings even more confident in the strength of our product portfolio that align with mega trends of safe, green and connected. Moving to Slide 14. Third quarter bookings were in line with the customer cadence for new business opportunities and include several conquest awards. A GDI award with VW and Dongfeng, a BMW for mission products and infotainment award with Shanghai GM as well as Ford wiring award, just to name a few.","Based on the current of remaining opportunities, we expect end-year roughly in line with prior year booking models. As you see on Slide 15, our priorities for this year remain unchanged and they're similarly focused on driving increased shareholder value. Our first priority is disciplined revenue growth, with a focus on a diversified mix of customers and region are continuously optimizing our operating footprint, were able to deliver consistently across the globe on a cost effective basis.","We recognized how critical the megatrends of safe, green and connected are to the industry and we provide the customers with technologies that offer solutions, to both the issues and the opportunities that these trends create. Our cost structure is truly best-in-class which provides significant margin expansion opportunity and is exemplified by the 60 basis points of margin expansion that, we delivered this past quarter.","Finally, we have proven our commitment to deploy capital in a very disciplined manner, year-to-date we have returned roughly $900 million of capital shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and have announced the two M&A transactions that I mentioned earlier. So in summary, we remained focus on the priorities that we are confident will drive increased shareholder value and with that, I will turn the call over to Mark, to cover the numbers. Mark?","Mark Murphy","Thanks, Kevin and thank you, Rod for the introduction. I'll begin by covering our third quarter results then provide update full year guidance. Consistent with prior earnings calls, to-date review of our actual and forecasted financial results exclude restructuring and other non-recurring items.","The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are included in the back of this presentation and the press release. Slide 17, provides a snapshot of our third quarter financial performance. Revenue increased over 3% to $4.1 billion. Operating income increased to $468 million and operating margins expand in 60 basis points to 11.3%.","Earnings per share increased roughly 20% to a $1.16 and operating cash flow increased over 25%. Moving to Slide 18, I'll review third quarter revenue in more detail. As mentioned, reported revenue increased over 3%, $4.1 billion. Price down to 1.6% represented $63 million headwind year-over-year, changes in foreign exchange and commodity prices largely offset, volume growth was a $189 million adding 5% to growth.","Recently European revenues came in as expected with solid growth in all segments with the expectation of electrical architecture due to the timing of the roll-off and roll-on of vehicle programs that we discussed previously. North Americas revenues increased near 6% driven by strong growth in the electrical architecture and thermal segments.","Revenue growth in Asia remains strong at roughly 9%, revenue in South America decline 20% which was more than our earlier expectations reflecting ongoing weakness in the region. Slide 19, loss year-over-year increase in operating income to $468 million and roughly three times revenue growth.","Strong material and manufacturing performance more than offset the impact of a gain on asset sale recognized last year. Resulting in operating margin expansion at 60 basis points. Slide 20 covers our segment results. Electrical architectures adjusted revenue totaled $2 billion, up 3% year-over-year driven by continued strong growth in North America and Asia.","This growth was partially offset by lower revenues in Europe and South America on economic weakness and program timing. Segment operating income increased to $254 million representing 12.7% operating margins flat from the prior year, due in part till one-time gain on an asset sale in the third quarter last year.","Revenue on our powertrain segment was over $1.1 billion. Up over 6% on the launch of new diesel and GDi programs. Segment operating income increased to $118 million and operating margins increased to 140 basis points to 10.4%. The result of flow through on sales growth and solid operating performance.","In electronic and safety revenue totaled $696 million, a 1% decrease from the prior period. The result of lower revenues in South America and a continued rationalization of our reception systems in mechatronics product portfolios.","Segment operating income totaled $84 million and operating margins increased 60 basis points on strong productivity. Thermal revenues increased 7% to $389 million driven by strong growth in all regions with South America. Thermal operating income was $12 million and operating margins increased 170 basis points over the prior year.","Turning to Slide 21, earnings per share increased 20% to $1.16 driven primarily by increased operating earnings and to a lesser extent a reduction in the effective tax rate and a lower share count. Moving to Slide 22, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet. Cash decreased to $1 billion reflecting normal seasonal investment in working capital.","The timing of capital expenditures for growth and roughly $900 million of share repurchases in dividends. That followed under $2.5 billion in net debt $1.4 billion representing a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.6 times. Slide 23, covers assumptions underlying our 2014 guidance. As Rod discussed, we are forecasting global vehicle production of approximately 91 million units, a 3% increase in global production.","Looking at our forecast by region, in North America our guidance assumes 5% increase in production. We are forecasting European production to increase 2%. In China, we anticipate production growth of 9% and in South America we are forecasting, a 17% decline in production based on continued economic weakness.","In light of the weakness in this market, restructuring initiatives are ongoing to further consulting our footprint. For the quarter, we are forecasting global vehicle production 1% to 2% over last year. Turning to Slide 24 to discuss our 2014 guidance. We adjusted our full year revenue range to reflect a weaker Euro, weak economy fundamentals in South America and program timing.","Our outlook for the operating income remains unchanged at $2 billion to $2.05 billion on the strength of our operating model and organizations ability to deliver strong operating leverage. For the full year, we expect records EBITDA and operating margins of 15.2% and 11.8% respectively.","We have raised lower-end of our EPS guidance to $5 to $5.10 on the strength of year-to-date earnings and assuming a 17% effective tax rate and share count of $302 million. Cash flow before financing is also unchanged and expected to total roughly $1.1 billion with capital expenditures projected to be $800 million.","With that, we would like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","A couple questions on the margins, one is just if you can give us a little bit more color in your bridge. The performance of $43 million compared with pricing of $63 million. You had mention that, that there would be spending this year and I'm assuming that's related to the disparity between the two numbers we are spending and just more broadly, what are the levers that you're pulling to achieve basically similar EBIT's through your prior guidance and actually better margin performance despite slightly lower revenue, than previously expected?","Kevin Clark","And do you have a second one, Rod or you'll, we'll hang over the follow-up. So why don't I start, as you walk through our overall results on year-over-year basis and you take a look at performances versus price downs. We talked about roughly $43 million of performance on year-over-year basis that is net of some incremental investment in IT and engineering.","We did throttle that back somewhat as we talk about previously in light of the softer volumes during the quarter, softer revenues during the quarter. on a year-over-year basis also, there is a roughly $10 million to $15 million of, you know Mark mentioned the one-time gain on an asset sale in the prior period within our EA division as well as commercial settlement, that was worth about $10 million.","So when you net out those two, you effectively offset price downs.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","The commercial settlement was this year $10 million.","Kevin Clark","No, that would have been in the prior year, I'm sorry. Third quarter, last year both were in third quarter last year.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, alright and just two other things. One is it looks like, you're anticipating some acceleration in organic growth here towards the end of the year. I think they hate your guidance, the organic growth would need to accelerate to 5% to 5.5% something like that and it was in 3's last quarter and this quarter. So maybe you can talk a little bit about what is coming in here and any updates on acquisitions or divestitures, that you might be contemplating?","Kevin Clark","Sure. So the first with respect acceleration to growth is going to come primarily from powertrain, you will see continued very strong growth in powertrain in the fourth quarter, that will be the result of the continued watch of some heavy duty diesel program that we've talked about previously, this is well as some of the Gas Direct Injection programs. Continued solid growth in our thermal segment, in line with what we reported for the third quarter.","As we talked about previously EA will be slower growth in the back half of this year versus what it was in the first half of the year, so that trend will continue but that will be more than offset by the results of powertrain and thermal. We respect to M&A environment, we announced the two this past quarter both will be closing in the fourth quarter. I think as we've articulated previously investors events, we have a very long pipeline of opportunities that we continue to pursue.","I'd like to say, we like to be in a position where there is some point next year. We have the opportunity to announce some interesting opportunity.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Divestitures, anything?","Kevin Clark","We don't comment on those sorts of matters. Consistent with part of practice.","Rod O'Neal","Hi, Rod. In order to answer the one question of \u2013 and is a very good one. How do we extend margins in an environment with the revenue of, wasn't climbing exactly as we would like it. I would just like to say that, there's nothing exotic. Just a continuation of high execution across multi fronts from manufacturing to engineering and the continued productivity and efficiency and effectiveness of the organization and I've said it before and I'll say it again here. I mean, we've come a long way as a company in terms of our ability to perform in multiple areas, but throughout travels. I continue to see areas, where we can do better and what we are doing is capitalizing on those areas.","So nothing exotic, no one-time kind of thing. It's just to continue execution with the team throwing multiple levers at the business and we're doing a great job.","Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is open.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays","Want to follow-up on a couple questions around growth, first macro kind of housekeeping one and then a more strategic question. On the housekeeping one, it looks like you actually outgrew Europe this quarter. You were up 80 basis points, 90 basis point despite light vehicle production down and commercial vehicle production down significantly.","Can you may be kind of give some color on what drove that outperformance and why it's kind of kicking in above production finally?","Kevin Clark","Sure, Brian why don't I start at least really that's primarily driven by powertrain and it's primarily driven by the launch of those heavy duty diesel programs that we have been talking about.","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays","","Okay and those were not yet into ramp up mode or they're not ramped to those mode?","","Kevin Clark","","Yes, those were not yet in full ramp up mode. They're ramping up now.","","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays","","So if, we want confidence in what you're saying about powertrain, you can see it in the European out performance this quarter?","Kevin Clark","Yes definitely, we see in the European outperformance. I will tell you, I think as we discussed previously the commercial vehicle market with that heavy duty diesel business play especially in Europe. These are market that's not, that's playing not quite as strong as what our original outlook was at the beginning of the year.","However, having said that, we are going to end of north of 20% growth in that product line as a result of those programs.","","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays","","And the broader question is really, how do you think about revenue versus margins, versus bottom line and maybe too particular kind of categories were it might come up. The first is, just in general as you look at business, look at the ROIC. Are you finding that, you want to pass on more bids or not follow, where the bidding is going down more than maybe your were couple years ago and is that effecting the revenue growth line, outlook.","The second one is more, as we talked to the OEMs. So talk a lot about value partnering and getting together and trying to think about ways to drive down input cost without sacrificing supplier margins or the kind of functionality to the OEM. So for example, Lear this morning talked about working with customers to take feeding yards of wires, out of a car by moving to smarter Junction Boxes.","JCI's talked about putting in cheaper, but better higher margin seat-frames. How to help their client growth the cost of seating [ph]? So how much of that kind of work is going on with your customers and how does that affect the revenue versus, margin versus, tradeoff?","Kevin Clark","So Brian, well I'll take and the first and Rod will come in the second. You know as we said, in the past, we are very focused on return on capital and very cognizant of the fact that we, operate in a business that has some element of cyclicality there, cyclicality in it and therefore as a result focused on margin.","I think it's safe to say, if you look at our bookings levels over the last couple years and what we forecast to book this year. Roughly $26 billion that at the end of the day, I would say, we are doing anything new. I think we continue to be very disciplined in terms of the opportunities that we pursue and we quote on and we are very disciplined threshold, with respect to metrics that programs need to meet.","So I would say, it's been relatively consistent. Rod, you should comment on that?","Rod O'Neal","President Yes, and I think the partnering with the OEs where it has improved dramatically over the last several years in terms of taking pure cost out and creating a win-win, but as we approach that minus [indiscernible]. I mean we've got multiple focuses as Kevin talked about. Return on investment capital and margin, but we also are very focused to making sure that is not just margin growth, but it's also the literal number get bigger.","In terms of EBITDA or OEs, whatever and so and then is one more aspect, Brian and we're focused on is the rotation, if you look at the booking. We are very focused on rotating of the company to its final state, which would be a balance and where Asia would be bigger and match up roughly at least a third, when it matched up to the other two regions are the main regions of North America and Europe.","So there is the financial aspect and there is diversification aspect as we look at bookings, where we want to book, who we want to book with and above making sure, the financials stay alike. Bottom line though, is that there is the partnerships have improved dramatically and we were working together to design cost outlook and making it a win-win.","","Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays","","Okay, thanks.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","More recently, there's been a lot of rumblings from auto makers here in North America that there is been some capacity shortages from suppliers and I'm just curios, whether you're seeing that in your own business or any other suppliers you're dealing with or you see that in adjacent supplier that might end up disrupting production and maybe even creating some waves across to your business?","Rod O'Neal","No, we are seeing that at all.","","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, that's good. Second question, you were to sell any part of your business and maybe raise $500 million to $1 billion, where do you think you would take those proceeds and allocate them?","","Kevin Clark","Listen John, at the end of the day with respect to cash, right. Consistent with what we've said in the past. Our objectives for deploying free cash flow or one, internal -- business to generate incremental growth. Two, value accretive M&A transactions and to the extent there aren't attractive opportunities to do either those, will return that cash to shareholders either via increased dividends or share repurchase.","","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","So it would very much go through the same funnel?","Kevin Clark","In times.","","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","That's useful. Okay and then just lastly as we look at Slide 19, you know the middle bar there foreign exchange versus commodities. I'm just curious what kind of benefit you got from commodities in the quarter. I thought, we are looking at mostly sort of past through in indexing and that seems like that was a pretty material offset to you, that foreign exchange headwind.","I'm just trying to understand, what the magnitude of each of those two components is and what the benefit from commodities was?","Kevin Clark","And the end of the day, it's really not a lot, it is primarily copper. There is a little bit of aluminum but net-net John, it's actually very small number.","","John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Your line is open.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","","Just a question on the revenue guidance. I think the range that you have now, little bit higher than what you have typically going into a quarter. Can you may be talk about what could cause you to be at the low-end or high-end of the range? And maybe also update us on the aftermarket business within that as well.","Kevin Clark","Sure, let me start with the aftermarket business. The aftermarket business, you will see again accelerated growth in the back half of this year. Principally in Q4, the result of improvements in the European market as well as, we've been launching some new programs here in North America.","With respect to what affects our overall guidance in the range of our overall guidance, truly to be a couple things. One FX, we've seen a lot of volatility in and around the euro and some of the other currencies, that's translational for us and now with respect to some variability potentially in the market.","South America as Mark had said, you know ended up a weaker market in the third quarter, then we'll expect to see. We continue to expect to be relatively weak. So there is possibly some volatility there. I would tell you, I think those were the two, really the two big things, that counted.","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","","That's helpful. As we think about 2015, I think your previously backlog number is about $1.2 billion, I mean how do you feel about that today kind of looking at the markets, we dialed that back perhaps a little bit for FX and market changes, any update you can provide on and kind of how do you feel about that backlog number for 2015?","","Kevin Clark","","Listen, I would say relative to how this year is shaping out from a revenue standpoint, that number likely is adjusted certainly for FX given where we talked today. It maybe a little bit as it relates to program volumes, but it's not a significant amount.","","Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citigroup","","Great, that's very helpful. Thanks so much guys.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shankar from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","","Ravi Shankar \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","On the Unwired acquisition, the product sounds like infotainment hardware product, when you guys are categorizing it and putting into a thin electrical because you see that, is more of a connector business, a connector margins. A; can you confirm that if that is a case and also within your E&S business, if you look at your incremental R&D spending, how much of that is going to active safety versus infotainment?","Kevin Clark","So why don't I take the first Rod, you can come on the second. With respect to where that business will reside you're right Ravi, it will be in the electrical architecture business and the connector business. We have a product portfolio that actually is complimentary with what they do and we believe that makes sense to actually put that business in that segment.","With respect to R&D spend, active safety versus infotainment.","Rod O'Neal","I think, when you look at active safety, we will somewhere in the low double-digit spin on the.","","Ravi Shankar \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Got it. And you basically said that, within your current base about $500,000 million comes from software and you expect that to grow about $0.30 within the next 5 years to 6 years, that's a fairly largish number. How much of visibility do you have on that growth and is it linear from this point or do you think it's more backend loaded?","Kevin Clark","Well, I'll take the first shot. Listen I think there's probably a bit more of it being backend loaded given the pace of new business bookings in around AS, Ravi as we've said last year we booked $1 billion of new business that was more than the prior 3 years combined. This year, we will book well over $1 billion and active safety dismiss. It will take a couple years for that business to effectively to roll on.","So based on where we sit today, I think the real ramp up is a couple years out.","Rod O'Neal","Yes and I think the other area code [ph] comes in the play would be in the electrification area and you know that, that space is a great space and we think that there is a lot for Delphi's both top and bottom line, but a lot of that is also be putting in some of the market factors, oil pricing and customers\u2019 acceptance etc. for how we sold.","You know a little bit of the linear thing, is sort of depends on the sum of macro issues, but that's another high code area for us in terms of software.","Ravi Shankar \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Understood and just lastly, the thermal has seen some pretty good margin improvement in the last couple of quarters. There is been some recent speculation that, you're potentially looking at strategic options for that business. Can you confirm that the margin improvement is kind of core performance gains and not just kind of putting off some of the costs because the business is potentially, up for sale?","Kevin Clark","Well, listen we're not going to comment on the speculation. With respect to business, as we've told you it's a great business. We had real opportunities to improve profitability for some operating initiatives cost reduction initiatives, restructuring initiative and the benefit of volume and all that is playing out, you're going to continue to see strong performance and strong results in that business for the balance of this year and in the next year.","Rod O'Neal","There is a lot to remember, we did say, we've built the business is proper place in terms of margin and our top EBITDA would be double-digit. Well, double digits and this is the just the blue torch, at destination.","","Ravi Shankar \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Very good, thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I guess, sort of a shorter term and longer term question. First just on the guidance revision, sorry if you guys said this already, but you know how much you kept the EBIT excuse I'm changed in changed in EPS, that of course there was a nudge down to revenue, which you offset with better incremental.","On the revenue side, how much of that tweak was FX or end market and well how much it was other things?","Kevin Clark","If you look at the tweak Patrick from the midpoint there is 100 to 125 that is FX related, the balance would be a mix of E&S a little bit softer than what we had originally had going into the year. Commercial vehicle although again I said, our revenue is being extremely strong not being quite as strong as originally anticipated and then the balance would be just markets in general, places like South America being bit softer.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Understood, I guess longer term. Just taking a step back beyond this quarter, can we just revisit the questions of margins because there is been a number of themes on business mix and stuff like that, that I think are important getting to that. I believe it's 16% and 16% that you've highlighted. How much of that is some of the business mix shift that's been kind of discussed in this call? How much of it is leverage structural cost, that sort of stuff?","Kevin Clark","You know listen, some of it is business mix, is for example the benefits of MVL transaction and increase conductor content in our business, a lot of it is, Rod had said to the earlier question, is just continuing to execute extremely well and I guess, if you look at our guidance and you measure the midpoint, we'll end up at roughly 15.3% EBITDA margins, this year. I'd say that's actually a bit of ahead of the pace that we would have expected a year or so ago.","And I think in light of that, you know we have a \u2013 continue to higher level of confidence to deliver on the 16% EBITDA margin to 2016.","Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, great helpful color. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan","","You know, you've mentioned before that the thermal business introduced you to some new OEM's, I mean you since had success on your other layers [ph] too. Where do you think you're along in that process, does thermal continue to open new doors for you or have you effectively entered those doors already?","Rod O'Neal","You know I'll be honest, it actually has played out like we said, still at the infant stages, but we have seen a lot of great drafting off of them.","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan","Great and then, you know you have a very well laid out and clearly communicated capital allocations strategy right, one of the best out there. You know regarding CapEx, growth-related R&D, dividends, repurchase and M&A. of course, that communicative plan is predicated upon your view of operating cash flow for the forecast window. So this question comes out of from a little bit of different of an angle, though, if you did happen to stumble into some sort of additional capital not accounted for in your current plan say non-operating related cash inflow.","How should investors think about what you might want to do with that. Presumably it would not need to go toward the CapEx or growth-related R&D because that is the first thing that you'd already sufficiently funded in the current plan. So do you think you'd look to lean more toward return to shareholders or maybe acquisition that raises your growth and margin profile? Thanks","","Kevin Clark","Listen, I think it's a version of the question you asked earlier. I think, based on where we sit here today. I think it's fair to say, you're right. It probably does not get, probably it doesn't get fall back into the business. It's either, you're either to pursue value creative M&A opportunities or to buy back stock. It's one or the other. So depending on the attractiveness of those two alternatives, we decide how best to deploy the capital.","","Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. That's helpful. Congrats on the quarter. Good to see the margin traction. Thanks.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Galves from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","","Daniel Galves \u2013 Credit Suisse","Wanted to ask about China. There's been some concern over kind of the pace of volume. It seems like your revenue growth in the quarter was basically in line with industry production, whereas usually it's a little bit better. Just talk about kind of what we should be expecting in the next couple of quarters, in terms of what you're seeing in the production schedules.","And then if you could remind us more medium term, what's baked into your kind of medium term targets for China industry growth and where do you see your revenue growth kind of above that?","Rod O'Neal","Let's go back in history, I mean. There is been a lot of naysayers over the past three years on China that, you know reached its peak and things were going to begin to slow. The only part that we agreed with is that, particularly in our industry is that, it would slow from the mid double-digit down into high single-digit. Certainly because the market had gotten so big, at 20 million going to 30 million units by 2018.","And so as we looked at it and we'll talk more about it at the beginning of the year. We'll talk about '15 and beyond. We still see China in the high single-digit growth areas and over the long time we will see us outperform that market and we are very positive, we are very robust on it. When you look at safety, green and connected.","These are the very trends that will catch them on fire in China. And so we are perfectly positioned today and even more in the future as the consumer and the government begins to plough deeply into the spaces that we are reoccupied and so our forecast are doubling the revenue of China that we gave you back in March. I believe we said, we will double by 2017. We still maintain, we will do that.","Kevin Clark","Yes and listen, if I can kind of overlay on a near term comment and with respect, our growth role in the China market. Our view as we grew, our pointers saw over market this quarter. Give more specific color. Our revenues impacted by some new vehicle change over programs that we are going out with some of the multinational companies they were, they were ramping down production of a couple platforms, but we will begin ramping up some new platforms in Q4.","So we will get the benefit of that and you will see an acceleration of growth in China in the fourth quarter.","Rod O'Neal","Yes and we'll come back to you. I need to go check something but I also think, that this traffic of some of the lower end vehicles, through that might impact some of the numbers, but in our space, we are pleased what happened and when we look to our schedules, we were pretty confident that what we see occurring is going to continue to occur.","Daniel Galves \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, great. And then kind of a similar question, on Electrical Architecture. Fantastic performing business over the last couple of years, revenue growth slowing. How long should we expect that to kind of persist? And you know kind of look to the quoting activity around this business, do you still see substantial content growth per vehicle in this segment over time?","Kevin Clark","Yes, with respect to trend in revenues and Rod, you can comment on the trend in electric content. You know as we said, on our last earnings call. Growth rate of EA segment was slow in the back half of this year. We begin to pick up from a growth rate standpoint early next year, but really accelerating in the back half, that's primarily related to the roll off programs or timing of the roll off program principally in Europe and then the roll on of new programs.","Rod O'Neal","","In terms of the market dynamics, it's a great space to be in continue content growth of the vehicle side, drives additional requirements both connectors and as well as wiring requirements on our side and so this business is, it's the premier business in its space. We continue to make sure, it says that way and when you look at the bookings that this organization has, is bringing along, even as we speak, is diversified geographically, customer base wise, margin expansion continues to occur.","We are very pleased with this portion of the company and we expect it to be pillar on the company going forward.","","Daniel Galves \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open","Joseph Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks for taking my question. Rodney, you started talking about some of this, but just given that you guys are so well positioned in China really a leader there. I was wondering if you could comment on a little bit more on some of the bigger picture issues going on there, maybe. Even though, you mentioned the scrappage [ph], I know there was a program put in place earlier this year \u2013 an update, what you see going on there? Anything on some of the antitrust work that's been done there or even more recently, a certain supplier clients, and negative mix impacts, specifically with some content issues on high, on more luxury type vehicles.","Rod O'Neal","Well, first of all. Let me just start with, I can't answer what people have said, other than I can say is, China like every other region in the world. You got to know what you're doing, otherwise your money is not going to show up and what our longevity there is a biggest unit, it's a big plus I mean, we are fortunate to have decade of operations in that space. And so, we have great partners, we are in control of our own destiny and as you know we own and operate all of our business, leave a 100% of majority control, have excellent connections with the proper government officials.","What we are seeing, let's just talk about the marketplace a little bit. Is a rapid evolution of the Chinese automobile market to a very European and a Western kind of standard, both in terms of what the customer prefers and now the government is now beginning to move in, particularly on safety, which is still in early stages but environmental particularly emissions in, fuel efficiency is front end center.","So you may have recently seen in a newspaper, where they committed to deeply enforce submission that fuel efficiencies with all of the OE's and so what we have said to you in the past, has proven to be true and it looks like it's going to accelerate. Is that, that the space of the green and safety will definitely accelerate from the government side as it begins to focus on these issues? So very positive environment and the consumer there is very sophisticated, very demanding as a result, the content of the vehicle are going to be like, in line with what we do too.","So very positive environment, both legislative wise as well as consumer preference wise.","Joseph Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then maybe just a little bit more on the business and going back to thermal, obviously good traction. I think earlier this year you mentioned you could still, you could exit at an operating margin of something close to 5%. Is that still the plan?","Kevin Clark","Yes, that would still be the plan.","Joseph Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lim from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","David Lim \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","When you look at your manufacturing capability and capacity, how much additional flow-through can you drive? You mentioned earlier that there are opportunities and wouldn't that improvement translate into stronger operating leverage for you guys?","Rod O'Neal","You're talking about incrementals?","David Lim \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Yes, exactly, correct.","Kevin Clark","Yes, listen, I think what we've consistently what we said in the past from an incremental EBITDA margin standpoint. We'd steered you guys towards using kind of 20% incremental EBITDA margins to forecast profit growth in the future on revenue growth. Does that, I want to make sure, I answered your question?","David Lim \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","That answers the second part. I was actually wondering in your current manufacturing footprint, with the efficiencies that you guys could probably isolate, where can we take that per let's say per plant, for example?","Rod O'Neal","You mean could we get better in the 20s?","David Lim \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Yes, I mean because you're driving with improvement where you could improve let's say the flow-through on your plant. I would guess you could probably get above that 20% if you were able to get the flow-through.","Rod O'Neal","I think just two things, one just getting better and little bit is the mix. As you know, our businesses are little different in terms of their backward integration model and so powertrain would have higher incrementals then perhaps like in the E&S. and so, I will say this, I think what Kevin said in terms of sticking in your model. I think you should go into the 20%, but just try that we are always trying to do better and when we actually go better than the 20%, we will tell you.","David Lim \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Got you. And my final question is, on the FX rate, what are you anticipating for Q4? And can we get sort of a preliminary read for 2015 what you're thinking?","Kevin Clark","Yes, I think FX rate for the fourth quarter, we are using is about 129 at this point in time. Visibility going forward is from a planning standpoint, we will probably use a rate roughly in line, with that.","David Lim \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Got you. Thank you so much.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Brett Hoselton \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","First simple question is I think in the investment community we're having a little bit of a difficult time reconciling that new business revenue growth with your revenue performance. I was hoping Kevin; you might be able to kind of walk through that. I mean as I look at the quarter, if I were to say the production was up maybe 2% in the quarter, and if you have 5% new business revenue growth and 1.5% price give backs, I would have kind of thought that you would have had maybe 5.5% revenue growth. How do I kind of think about maybe the other moving pieces or parts that gets us down to like 3.2%?","Kevin Clark","I think, at the end of the day that net new business is an attempt to simplify something that is highly complex, right? We are on multiple platforms with multiple OE's across multiple region and is, does not take into account the effect of mix. I think, if you do the simple math, you're absolutely right, but you can't take into account the simple math.","I guess, if I were to take a stepback and look at net new business for 2014 relative to what we originally communicated. I think we said roughly $800 million in that new business wasn't forecast. 2014 in light of South America, in light of a little softer commercial vehicle market. I'd have to say, net new business would be a bit shy that, I don't have a an exact number, but wouldn't quite acquaint to the $800 million.","Brett Hoselton \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Very good answer. Thank you very much. And then Rodney, I know you're not retired yet, but since you've announced it, congratulations. Very good job with you and your team at this company. You guys have really done an outstanding job. So congratulations. My question here is, Kevin, how do we think about the potential changes in direction at the company, as Rodney steps down and you step into that role?","Do you see any material or significant changes taking place? Or is this more along the lines of we're on a good road, we're just going to kind of keep the course?","Kevin Clark","","I mean two things, one we're on a great road and as we continue to course. I think two; we got to remind, I've been here it's hard to believe 4.5 years. I have been working with Rod in support of developing and executing the regular ongoing refinement of the strategy and it's worked extremely well and there is no reason to change them.","Brett Hoselton \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Excellent. Thank you very much. Gentlemen","","Operator","","","Your last question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Your line is open.","","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","Thanks for taking my questions. I only have a couple left. I apologize if I missed this. Any color on the revenue impact from the recent acquisitions? Is that going to be material to next year?","Kevin Clark","No, for next year, yes. For next year, it will be a north of $100 million.","","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","","For both together.","Kevin Clark","For both together, yes.","","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","","And the margins are similar to your current business?","Kevin Clark","More margins are in line with connectors like margins.","","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","","Great, okay. And then you confirmed that you're looking for a 5% margin in thermal in Q4. What are the drivers that quarter-over-quarter that are going to get you there because I think you're only at 3.1% in this quarter?","","Kevin Clark","Well you know, the third quarter as you know from a seasonal standpoint you have more startup and shutdowns in North American. So you just, naturally run less efficient and I think if you look across all of our segment. You know with the exception of quite frankly E&S that is the case. So you will see the normal cadence of stable volume, stable production the fourth quarter that will benefit and then, two it's just the ongoing benefit associated with the cost improvement productivity initiatives that they're executing.","","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","And then last question on E&S, you mentioned mechatronic being a headwind again. When does that roll-off complete? Is that mostly done? Or is there some, a couple quarters stuff?","","Kevin Clark","Yes, by in large it rolls off in the back half of '15. It's about two point headwind in the E&S growth rate today. It will continue to be at the heart of two point headwind, into the back half of '15, but then it gets to a point where it's and a level in the roll-off is such that, it's less for now.","","Colin Langan \u2013 UBS","","Okay, well.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. Thank you.","Elena Rosman, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Elena D. Rosman - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thank you. Good morning, Kim, and thank you, everyone, for joining Delphi's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. To follow along with today's presentation, our slides can be found at delphi.com under the Investors section of the website.

Additional details of the prior-period impacts are included in the appendix of today's presentation. We have also presented our Q1 2016 financials on a pro forma basis, excluding the results of our Mechatronics divestiture, which we sold at the end of last year, and provided a reconciliation in the appendix of our presentation as well.","Please see slide 2 for a disclosure on forward-looking statements, which reflect Delphi's current view of future financial performance, which may be materially different from our actual performance for reasons that we cite in our Form 10-K.","Joining us today will be Kevin Clark, Delphi's President and CEO, and Joe Massaro, CFO and Senior Vice President. As seen on slide 3, Kevin will provide a strategic update on the business, including an overview of today's portfolio announcement, and then Joe will cover the financial results and our outlook for 2017 in more detail. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Well, thanks, Elena. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Before Joe gets into our financial results, I'll provide highlights around the first quarter and then spend some time discussing this morning's announcement of our plans for a tax-free spin-off of our Powertrain segment into a new, independent company.","Starting with the first quarter, our results reflect a great start to the year, with the positive trends we saw in the fourth quarter continuing, including strong growth in revenue, operating margin, and earnings per share, and new business awards driven by the strength of our technology portfolio. Based on our results, we remain confident in our 2017 outlook.","Staying on slide 5, the spin transaction we announced today reflects the company's continued evolution and positioning to strengthen our capabilities to solve our customers' biggest challenges and drive increased value for our shareholders. The convergence of the technologies underpinning the safe, green, and connected megatrends is driving the need for an exponential increase in computing power and faster signal distribution to deliver increased vehicle safety and connectivity.","At the same time, more stringent regulatory requirements targeting reduced CO2 emissions and improved fuel efficiency are requiring increasingly complex Powertrain technologies. As the pace of change accelerates and the needs of our customers continue to evolve, we feel now is the right time to establish two strong, strategically well-positioned companies, each with a great portfolio of relevant technologies, a global footprint, a lean and flexible cost structure, and the financial flexibility to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities, all of which translates into a compelling growth outlook.","Turning now to slide 6. Since our IPO in 2011, we've been executing our strategy to strengthen our business and expand our capabilities through organic investments, acquisitions, and minority investments in key technologies, all aligned to the safe, green, and connected megatrends. We optimized our portfolio with actions that better positioned us to leverage the industry's secular growth trends. And, as a result, we've built an industry-leading portfolio of high-value technologies that include strong foundations and smart vehicle architecture solutions, such as centralized computing; power and signal distribution; high-value connection systems and cable management; sensing and computing domain expertise, which enhances our active safety; autonomous driving; connected car and data analytics capabilities; and powertrain technologies such as gas direct injection, power electronics and variable valve train.","During the same period, it's become clear that our customers' needs are rapidly changing. The technologies underpinning vehicle electrification, autonomous driving, and vehicle connectivity are converging, as these systems all require smart vehicle architecture, which leverage the capabilities of our Electric Architecture and Electronics and Safety businesses. And advanced engine management solutions are requiring a more focused strategy to introduce new propulsion technologies, including electrification, to meet the increasingly stringent regulatory landscape.","Moving to slide 7. Upon completion of the spin transaction, our Electrical Architecture and Electronics and Safety businesses will combine to be a global technology leader with unparalleled strength in smart vehicle architecture, centralized computing platforms, as well as fully integrated systems for advanced safety, autonomous driving, infotainment, and user experience, as well as vehicle connectivity and data management. This business will include 145,000 employees, more than 15,000 engineers, have annual revenues of $12 billion and operating margins of almost 14%, and over $19 billion of new business awards in 2016.","Our Powertrain business will also be a global technology leader, focused on optimizing vehicle propulsion systems by enhancing environmental efficiency and vehicle performance through advanced fuel injection and valve train technologies, as well as power electronics. This business will be a supplier to both original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket customers. It will have over 20,000 employees with more than 5,000 engineers and revenues of approximately $4.5 billion, industry-leading operating margins of 11.5%, and new business bookings of almost $7 billion in 2016.","Now, Liam Butterworth, currently President of the Powertrain segment, will be the company's President and CEO. The company will be chaired by Tim Manganello, the former Chairman and CEO of BorgWarner and current Delphi board member. Both Tim and Liam are talented, well-respected Powertrain leaders with proven track records, making them ideally suited to lead the new company into the future. In summary, the outcome will be two independent and well-resourced companies with the flexibility to invest and grow even faster and more profitably than they are today.","Turning to slide 8. You can see our vision for our Electrical Architecture and Electronics and Safety businesses, which is to enable smart mobility architectures. We're seeing a paradigm shift in the vehicle's computing power, its connectivity, and the ecosystems that support it. The technologies in these two businesses are uniquely positioned to deliver end-to-end smart mobility solutions, integrating smart vehicle architecture with mobility computing platforms, serving as the only provider of both the brain and the nervous system of the vehicle.","As a standalone company, this business will focus its resources and investments to accelerate the commercialization of advanced technologies and systems for active safety, for autonomous driving, data services, and infotainment while providing the high-speed sensing and networking architecture that is required throughout the vehicle. No other company will be better positioned to advance integrated high-speed sensing and networking and software-enabled vehicle features for their customers.","Slide 9 captures our vision for the Powertrain business which, simply put, is to enable advanced vehicle propulsion through engine management, software, and electrification solutions. Our comprehensive portfolio for optimizing vehicle propulsion enables regulatory compliance while at the same time enhancing the performance of the vehicle. In addition to helping our customers meet the increasingly stringent regulatory standards, our technologies unlock the power needed to support the ever-increasing electrical content being added to the vehicle. As a standalone powertrain company, the business will have increased flexibility to further enhance its portfolio of advanced technologies and leverage its systems integration capabilities to solve the propulsion challenges of the future, which will accelerate the growth in powertrain electronics, advanced gasoline systems, and powertrain products.","Turning to slide 10. As I mentioned, the two companies will benefit from well-balanced portfolios, each with sizable addressable markets, which provide the opportunity for long-term sustainable growth as we continue to partner closely with our customers to meet their evolving needs. So in summary we believe today's announcement is great for all stakeholders, creating two well-positioned companies for the long term, each with very strong management teams with long-standing customer relationships and proven track records, leading portfolios of advanced technologies that solve their customers' biggest challenges, and strong operating discipline, delivering more revenue growth, more margin expansion, earnings, and cash flow generation, all of which will drive long-term shareholder value.","So with that I will hand the call over to Joe to take us through the first quarter results, our outlook for 2017, and key transaction details. Joe?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone.","Beginning on slide 12, Delphi had another quarter of strong new-business bookings across the portfolio, totaling $6 billion, following record-breaking levels in the fourth quarter. As you can see from the chart on the left, key growth technologies, including active safety, electrification, infotainment user experience, and advanced gas systems, have represented an increasing portion of our bookings since 2011, and that trend continued into the first quarter, putting us on track to exceed last year's record of almost $26 billion of bookings. Our core businesses representing established product lines that form the foundation for many of our new technologies continue to see new bookings growth as well.","On the right side of the chart, we highlight several key wins, including a major power electronics win from Geely and Volvo for production in both Asia and Europe, a global active safety win with a large North American OE, a significant Electrical Architecture conquest win with SGM in China, and an infotainment user experience conquest win with a large OEM in Europe. In summary, another great quarter of business wins.","Slide 13 provides a summary of our first quarter financial performance. As Kevin said, we are very pleased with our solid start to the year. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 9%, led by strong growth in every region and business. Our EBITDA margins expanded 20 basis points on a pro forma basis to 16.5%, and operating margins expanded 20 basis points to 12.5%.","As Elena mentioned, the adoption of a new pension accounting standard resulted in a $7 million reclass of certain pension costs from operating expense to other expense, with no impact to net earnings. Earnings per share grew 23%, primarily due to strong volume flow-through, partially offset by FX and commodity headwinds. There was also some benefit from a slightly lower-than-expected tax rate. We generated operating cash flow of $290 million, well above prior-year levels, and we returned $270 million of cash to shareholders in the quarter, including approximately $200 million of share repurchases, on track for the $600 million share repurchase target for the year.","Turning to slide 14, let's look at revenue in the quarter in greater detail. Beginning with the walk on the left, on a pro forma basis \u2013 excluding Mechatronics, price-downs of 1.8%, and FX and commodity headwinds of $82 million \u2013 we're in line with expectations. Adjusted sales growth of 9%, well above 4% global vehicle production for the quarter, was driven by stronger growth in Europe and Asia, including higher take rates on active safety and new infotainment launches in E&S; strength in our Powertrain business, driven by strong growth in GAAP (14:41) and commercial vehicle volumes in North America and China; also, South America was up over 15% in the quarter, albeit off a relatively low base.","Turning to operating income, slide 15 walks the year-over-year change in the quarter. Operating income was $537 million, up 10%, and operating margins were 12.5%, up 20 basis points, adjusting for the sale of Mechatronics. Price, FX, and commodity headwinds all partially offset strong flow-through on volume growth. We experienced a net $26 million performance headwind in the quarter related to two separate commercial settlements, which I will cover in a moment, partially offsetting positive performance gains. Overall, another quarter of strong year-over-year performance, having lapped certain operational challenges we had last year.","Turning to the segments on slide 16, let's start with Electrical Architecture on the left. Sales grew 4% in the first quarter, driven by double-digit growth in HellermannTyton and solid growth in the power and signal distribution business. E\/EA margins expanded 50 basis points due to improved performance, partially offset by the expected unfavorable timing of copper escalations in the quarter.","Powertrain delivered 8% organic growth, with double-digit gains in power electronics, gas direct injection, and variable valve train. Powertrain margins expanded 250 basis points due to strong sales flow-through and a $17 million favorable commercial settlement related to a previously disclosed program cancelation in 2016. Without this settlement, margins would have expanded 100 basis points to 12.2%. As we have discussed, our guidance includes a continued decline in light duty diesel revenues in Europe. However, our balanced portfolio of leading gas and commercial vehicle solutions is driving continued strong growth, giving us confidence in our outlook for mid-single digit organic growth in Powertrain in 2017 and beyond.","Moving to Electronics and Safety. Adjusted revenue grew 27% in the quarter, driven by new infotainment launches and strong active safety take rates. E&S margins were 5.9%, negatively impacted by a commercial settlement of a warranty matter, which had a $43 million impact in the quarter. Without the settlement, E&S margins would have been 11.1%. Regarding our investments for growth, our outlook continues to reflect a spending ramp in automated driving and software and service investments expected to be made over the course of the year.","Slide 17 walks our EPS year over year, which grew 23% versus Q1 2016, driven by organic sales growth, lower year-over-year tax rate, interest expense, and share counts. EPS was $0.14 higher versus the midpoint of our guidance, of which $0.12 was attributable to stronger volume and operating performance and $0.02 was the result of a more favorable tax rate.","Turning to slide 18, we've provided our guidance for the second quarter and outlook for the year. Our guidance for the second quarter reflects $4.2 billion of revenue at the midpoint, up 5% organic or 6 points above market, driven by double-digit growth in E&S, mid-single digit growth in Powertrain, and low single digit growth in E\/EA, all in line with our prior expectations. Margins are expected to be up 10 to 30 basis points, reflecting continued improvement in operating performance, partially offset by our planned E&S investments. Earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.68 per share, up 9% at the midpoint.","Despite a strong start to the year, we are maintaining forecasts for revenues to be up mid-single digit organic in the range of $16.5 billion to $16.9 billion. While there are puts and takes by market, we continue to plan for flat global vehicle production and monitor the cautionary market trends. However, if volume is stronger than expected, we're in a good position to capitalize on stronger flow-through. For the full year, we are reflecting the reclassification of pension costs from cost of sales and SG&A to other expense, effectively moving those costs below the line, so no impact to earnings per share. Operating income is expected to be $2.26 billion, with margins up approximately 30 basis points year over year at the midpoint, and earnings and cash flow are in line with prior guidance.","Turning to slide 19, Kevin talked about our portfolio transformation at the onset of today's call, and now I'd like to take a minute to reflect on Delphi's performance over that same time period. Aligning our portfolio to the safe, green, and connected megatrends has allowed us to grow at an average rate of over 5% per year organically since 2010, and operating income margins will have expanded 500 basis points to 13.5%, evidence that our relentless focus on managing our costs has allowed us to further increase our operating leverage. More income yields more cash, as cash flow from operations has more than doubled over that time period, driven by strong earnings growth, lower taxes, and effective capital management.","Increased cash flow has translated into more opportunities to drive shareholder value through disciplined and accretive deployment. We've returned roughly $5 billion to shareholders since the IPO through dividends and share repurchases. And during that time we've spent over $2 billion on M&A, supplementing our portfolio with higher growth, higher margin businesses. We will continue to have a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, focused first on investing in our businesses organically through growth investments in engineering and CapEx, then inorganically through accretive M&A. As a result, we have generated industry-leading returns for our shareholders, with total shareholder returns of over 300% since our IPO, more than double the S&P return over that same period, validating that we know how to grow, execute, and outperform in any environment.","With that in mind, let's turn to slide 20, where I'll walk you through the spin transaction timing and expectations in more detail. The transaction will be structured as a pro rata, tax-free distribution to our shareholders, which we expect to complete by March of 2018. Once completed, the two companies will be standalone public entities with individual management teams focused on accelerating disciplined revenue growth while continuing Delphi's track record of expanding margins, increasing cash flows, and accretive capital deployment. Over the coming months, we will be providing additional financial and transaction details, including the SpinCo Form 10, which we expect to file with the SEC in June. In addition, we are planning to present the strategic and financial outlooks for both companies at our annual investor conference in the fall. As Kevin discussed at the onset of today's call, we're excited about the incremental value that can be created by these two companies going forward.","I'd like now to hand the call back to Kevin for his closing remarks.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks, Joe.","Let me summarize on slide 21 before turning it over for Q&A. Delphi delivered another strong quarter with solid revenue and earnings growth, which was a continuation of the positive trends we saw across the company over the course of 2016. Our great start gives us confidence in our outlook for the full year. As Joe said, mid-single digit organic revenue growth, 30 basis points of margin expansion, and double-digit earnings growth.","We remain committed to staying in front of evolving market dynamics and trends to ensure that our business is always positioned to deliver significant value to our customers and outsized returns to our shareholders. We believe the strategic rationale for the spin-off of our Powertrain segment reinforces that commitment by creating two well-positioned companies aligned to evolving industry trends, each with increased flexibility to pursue distinct strategies that will better position them to solve our customers' biggest challenges, accelerate revenue and earnings growth, and increase shareholder value.","So with that we'll open up the call for questions.","Elena D. Rosman - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thank you. Kim, we'll now take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Good morning, Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Congratulations on this move. I think it's going to be very well-received. I had a couple questions on the spin. First, can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about the capital structure of the NewCo versus the RemainCo? And if we were to think about how overhead costs would be allocated \u2013 so we obviously see what you guys reported on a segment basis for EBIT and EBITDA, if we were to adjust that for what the company would look like on a standalone basis.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Sure. Joe, you want to?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Rod, it's Joe. So we're still early days working through the capital structure, obviously, and that process will commence at a quicker pace post-announcement. But we'd expect RemainCo to maintain its investment-grade rating. There will be a dividend from SpinCo to RemainCo for some deleveraging to do that. Those exact amounts and the exact structures is \u2013 again, is something we'll work through over the next two months, following up from the announcement.","As it relates to overhead costs, a couple ways to think about it. One, we do allocate overhead costs to our segments, so there is a portion of Delphi's overhead and standalone public company costs already in the Powertrain numbers. As we look at it today, there'd be some incremental, but we do not believe it would be material to stand Powertrain up on a standalone basis. Those same amounts would be effectively stranded costs for RemainCo. We expect the stranded costs based on our initial analysis to be slightly more than we had with Thermal. As you recall, we had about $60 million in stranded costs with Thermal. We expect the Powertrain stranded costs to be more than that but still less than $100 million, and we would expect to work our way through those over the first 18 months to 24 months following the spin, much like we did after the sale of Thermal.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Rod, if I can add to Joe's comment, just philosophically, listen, our view on this transaction is the best timing to do something like this is when businesses are doing well and you're coming off a position of strength. Our philosophy as it relates to capital allocation and use of cash, I think obviously it's driven value for our shareholders, and that's a philosophy that we certainly would maintain at RemainCo and certainly would expect some mix of that to remain with the spun Powertrain business.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","It makes sense. And I was also hoping you can maybe talk a little bit about the expected growth rate that you've got for the Powertrain business, what you've assumed in terms of light vehicle diesel. And then, kind of more broadly, there's a lot of discussion about consolidation in both spaces. There've been some articles about even the Delphi Powertrain business, but certainly in electronics and software and so forth. And just what is your perspective on the participation of each of those businesses vis-\u00e0-vis industry consolidation?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Sure, Rod. It's Joe. I'll take the light duty diesel question, and then Kevin can follow up on your second part.","So our view right now, and this has been very consistent over really the last year-plus, we have light duty diesel revenues, which for us is primarily pass car and light commercial vehicle in Europe. We have those revenues decreasing 3% per year over the next couple years, through our forecast period of 2019, effectively following down light duty diesel penetration in that car part. At this point, there continues to be a discussion, and I would say a lot of differing views on that, but we think we're consistent with where our customers are at. We're consistent with what we're seeing in schedules. And certainly some of the forecasting agencies \u2013 their projections of between now and 2019, 2020, light duty diesel penetration sort of going from the high 40s percentage to the low 40 percentage. So that is unchanged at this point, and we think that's the right place to be.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. And then to augment that, Rod, listen, when you break it down by segment at a high level, our outlook for revenue growth is mid-single digits for Powertrain. So obviously, as Joe's talked about before, very strong growth in gas direct injection, very strong growth in heavy duty and medium duty commercial vehicle, very strong growth in power electronics, offsetting that light duty diesel headwind.","As it relates to Electronics and Safety, very strong double-digit growth, Electrical Architecture, low to mid-single digit growth just given its market position, but we think with the separation of these two companies, the increased focus on developing advanced technologies, those are growth rates and profit margins that should actually improve.","As it relates to consolidation within the industry, listen, consolidation has been something that's talked about a long time in this industry, both at a OE as well as at a supplier level. Our rationale for the CSLP partnership with both Mobileye and Intel was really about how do you leverage the capabilities across the industry, whether it's through formal consolidation or informal partnerships? And, listen, we're in areas of technology that are going to require more focused investment, increased investment, and I think there are multiple ways to fund that, whether it be through physical consolidation, acquisition, mergers, et cetera, or more formal strategic partnerships like what we have. Hopefully that answers your question.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is open","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning. I want to follow up on that with some more questions around the Powertrain vision. If you take a OEM who wants to, say, do 48-volt and then evolve into a plug-in hybrid, before we've heard about how the different business units within current Delphi work together on that. Can you give us a sense of, A, how bundled or separate those decisions really are and then, B, how that's addressed in this new two-company structure?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Sure. Sure. I'll start, Brian. Listen, from a bundling product standpoint \u2013 they're completely separate from a technology and product standpoint. Go-to-market, where it makes sense from a customer standpoint, that's where we partner. We're doing a lot of that now in China, and would expect by the end of the year to have a few joint programs won and announced. And post-spin we'd expect as long as we are continuing to drive value for each separate independent business, that's a cooperation that we would continue to have.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So the components that would go into, say, a plug-in hybrid system apart from the electrical architecture, things like inverters, converters, maybe at some point motors, control algorithms \u2013 those would be part of Powertrain, not RemainCo?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","So let me be clear. So all of that product portfolio that about a year ago we moved out of Electronics and Safety into Powertrain, because that's where the decision was being made from a purchase and engineering standpoint. So inverters, converters, all the products that you just mentioned, that will sit within the Powertrain business.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So I guess that means that Powertrain isn't just a run-off internal combustion engine company; it can participate in this shift in Powertrains.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","No. No, no. Let me make really clear: We have a great Powertrain business that's very well-positioned, that has a great product portfolio, including power electronics. And this is about how do we position it to increase the flexibility, to accelerate investment, to increase growth, increase profitability, and to be in a better position to serve our customers.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And have you had any feedback this morning from some of your OEMs?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. We've spoken to all of our major OEMs, and the feedback is all positive.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker from Baird. Your line is open.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Good morning, David.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Good morning, David.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Congratulations on this. This is a great move. As we look at the business, are there any structural issues that you would take, that you would look at, either further divestitures, or potential places where you're looking to add on onto the two businesses?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. Listen, I wouldn't say we have structural issues or gaps. I think both businesses will look at opportunities to further enhance their product portfolio, whether that be through organic investment or acquisitions.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then one on the quarter here. Good bookings number here again. Can you give a little discussion about what the bidding activity is and how robust is it? And are you seeing any new players that you're bumping into as you're bidding on new contracts?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. Listen, the activity is roughly in line with what we had last year. I think the funnel is actually a little bit larger. We'd expect our bookings this year to be in excess of what we booked last year, which was $26 billion. With respect to new entrants or new players bidding on business, I'm not seeing anything noteworthy. Joe, do you ... ?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","No, nothing from a new entrant perspective, David. I would say that bookings are very lumpy, right? If you looked at ...","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Right.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","... 2015 and 2016, bookings were probably a little more heavily weighted to the beginning of the year. In 2017, normal flow had them a little more weighted to the back end of the year. That would be the only thing I'd point out.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And congratulations, again. That's an exciting move for everybody.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks, David.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks, David.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Your line is open.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Good morning, Itay.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So I think on Powertrain you mentioned an expectation of continued mid-single digit top line growth beyond 2017. Hoping we could talk a little bit about just perspective? I know it's early days as we kind of go through the numbers, but margin in the next couple of years, and whether you anticipate any potential increase in R&D or anything else post the spin for the Powertrain business.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Well, certainly from \u2013 listen, I think as a standalone business that they will be able to make capital deployment investment decisions based on where they see that technology going. That business has worked very hard. That team, Liam and his team, have worked very hard to improve the margin structure of that business. And certainly, much like Delphi has done, I think the expectation would be continued margin expansion while investing in new technologies. I certainly wouldn't see that changing. And, again, they've done a great job with their footprint rotation and making smart investments in that business. So we'll obviously come out with that later as we get past the Q2 release and into Investor Day, but I don't see any major changes coming from that perspective.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. Listen, I would say thematically, Liam and his team are great operators who have executed really well from a cost structure standpoint. So we'll experience very solid operating margin expansion this year. Into the out years, even with increased investments, I think Liam, as well as \u2013 you're all familiar with Tim Manganello \u2013 they're very focused on revenue growth and profit improvement. So thematically you would see no change.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's very helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up on the quarter, on the sales growth flow-through. I think it was quite a bit stronger than the past several quarters. Just wondering how we should think about that the rest of the year? And kind of what drove the strength in the quarter? And what are some of the puts and takes to think about as we model that going forward?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. I think it's very similar to our discussion in the fourth quarter, where we saw a fairly strong flow-through. We've been forecasting for flat market, continue to do so. To the extent there is volume upside, we will flow stronger, and as we plan \u2013 we've talked about as we plan for flat volume, that's how we think about capital deployment. That's how we think about investment, expense management. So to the extent we get concentrated bursts of higher volume, which we've seen particularly in China Q4 and Q1 and again in Europe as well, we tend to flow stronger. I would focus on \u2013 I think our margin guidance that we're providing for the full year, Itay, is certainly where we're planning to be. And, again, we're going back to forecasting flat market. And to the extent there's upsides in various markets, we should flow a little stronger.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. If I could just quickly follow up on that, Joe, is the strong-flow through on the base business? Or is it also on new backlog, new launches coming through? Or it may be both.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","It's probably \u2013 it's on both. It's on both. We're getting the volume from new launches. Take rates in E&S were very strong in both China and Europe, particularly in active safety and infotainment, but the base business is, particularly in the Electrical Architecture space, is seeing some performance gains after some of the challenges they had last year.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. That's very helpful. Thanks so much, and congratulations.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Good morning, Adam.","Adam M. Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, everybody. Also \u2013 hi. Great move. The timing couldn't be better. So I might have missed this earlier in the call, but would you care to comment on those reports that you held recent talks with Continental on combining your respective Powertrain ops?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Listen, we don't comment on market rumors. So I'd leave it at that.","Adam M. Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's fine. I mean, Kevin, I respect that. I do think that if you're not going to categorically deny it, your customers and investors will probably assume you did, but that's neither here nor there. I guess the question then is, is there any logic in having \u2013 if you don't comment on that, whether you had talks \u2013 is there any logic in potentially having discussions with someone like Conti on getting cost savings and working on growth opportunities for Powertrain?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. Listen, Adam, I'd answer it this way. We really mean this. We have a great Powertrain business that's very well-positioned that has some tremendous opportunity out there that we believe by setting up as a separate, public company they're better positioned to pursue. And, as a result, they'll be a better supplier to their customers, and all that will translate to better value for shareholders.","Adam M. Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Having said that, you saw the roadmap slide that I walked through. We're about driving shareholder value and making sure we do it in a way that benefits our customers. So that's how I'd respond.","Adam M. Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. And I appreciate that. And just one follow-up. You mentioned that \u2013 I think the way you describe it is that the separation can actually provide a revenue synergy for both companies, that you can actually pursue growth and\/or margin expansion opportunities even better separately than together. But I would assume there may be some dis-synergies as well that could be netted off against the synergies. I don't know if you could highlight some of the maybe obvious areas of either where you are able to get business when you go to market together or any cost sharing or other \u2013 material buy or anything that we could consider in the netting of it, if you will.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. No, that's a great question. Listen, short term, I think there definitely are some dis-synergies. I don't think they're huge, but there are some. Joe alluded to what's called the corporate or overhead cost. There'll be some duplication for a brief period of time. There is a benefit in scale, things like sourcing that you just talked about. There's also some benefit with respect to leveraging technology like electronics between, for example, Electronics and Safety as well as our Powertrain business, ECUs.","Having said that, given how rapidly this industry is evolving, given how complex the technology is getting, given the amount of convergence that's going on between historically what we referred to as electrical architecture and what's going on in autonomous driving and infotainment and user experience, I think being focused, laser-focused, is going to drive faster development of technologies and quite frankly more revenue benefit and more margin benefit. And I think having both businesses separate gives you more flexibility, gives the management teams more flexibility to make those decisions and maybe not have to assess as many of the trade-offs, Adam.","Adam M. Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it, Kevin. Great job, team.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Okay, thanks.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris McNally from Evercore. Your line is open.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Thanks so much, guys, and congrats again on the strategic decision. So just a slight alteration to some of the questions that have already been asked. So the power electronics, which will remain in Powertrain \u2013 I think it's like 60% of your content per vehicle in an EV. So I guess that means you'll really still have a heavy if not a positive transition from internal combustion engine to EVs within Powertrain. I guess my question is, does it make sense at some point to get into some of the more hard components \u2013 you know, electric motors, drive modules? Or do you think that there's not an advantage to bundling everything that would be relevant to an EV?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. Listen, as it relates to systems, there always is a benefit from an efficiency and a cost standpoint to have a system. The reality is, though, we have a customer base \u2013 or most of our customers, to be candid with you in that area in and around Powertrain like to buy in components. So that's something that you need to be cognizant of. We have, and Liam and team I'm sure will continue, to evaluate other areas within their product portfolio in and around EVs or powertrain electronics, where they'll decide they want to be in the business versus partnering with somebody who's in the business today. And I think that'll be a capital allocation trade-off.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Okay. I mean, so is the way to interpret that \u2013 I mean, it doesn't have to \u2013 you can maybe have collaborations rather than actual capital market mergers of \u2013 okay. Perfect.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. I think on some of the products that you mentioned, our view today is that it's likely some of those become commodity-like, and that you're better off buying versus making. And there is a universe out there of very capable suppliers that are happy to partner with a company like Delphi to provide that product in a system.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yes, Chris, motors are a good example of that. We have a couple of partnerships in place now in the Powertrain business, including a motor provider in China that's a big part of our product offering there. So there are opportunities in the marketplace to do it without deploying capital.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Perfect. And, if I may, just one real quick follow-up on E&S, where you had this big warranty. We've now had sort of two quarters in a row where you had warranty expenses that you haven't called out in your non-GAAP items, and they've been pretty big. Quite frankly, the two quarters would look spectacular if you didn't have these expenses. How do we think about quantifying them going forward? I mean, should we think about them truly as one-time, or is this the type of thing that could come up on a more regular basis?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Well, listen. The two items that you're referring to, fourth quarter and first quarter, related to, let's call it, older technologies that are out there. I'll start, and Joe should be able to get into more detail. When you look at warranty, the reality is there's a big chunk of warranty that is lumpy at the end of the day. It's a lumpy expense. And I think, based on that, I think our conclusion was we're better off keeping them in the numbers and highlighting them for you.","And, Joe, I should turn it over to you.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, no, Chris, Kevin nailed it. It is lumpy. It's obviously hard to forecast. The way I think about it, the reason we haven't called it out or referred to it as nonrecurring, if you look at the past five years or six years since we've been public, we average about $100 million of warranty expense in a year. Now, there's one year where just the timing, it's $140 million and the next year it's $60 million, but that tends to be the way we think about it. It's not a trend. This is not something we see increasing over time. That range of somewhere right around $100 million per year on a five-year or six-year base is where we think about it, but in a given quarter, it's just going to stick out a bit. It's going to be lumpy. And, again, that's the reason we haven't backed it out and wouldn't advise to.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks so much, guys.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lim from Wells Fargo. Your line is open","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, Kevin and Joe.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Good morning, David.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. With this spin-off, can you give us an idea of how the backlog would look between RemainCo and the SpinCo, if you would?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. Well, we've talked about it, and we'll go to the deck. I think from a bookings perspective, if you want to use 2016 as a proxy of our $26 billion in bookings, round numbers, about $19 billion sits in RemainCo, $7 billion sits in Powertrain, and that ratio is generally consistent.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. Thank you for that. And then also can you give us some color on how China is sort of unfolding, as you see it? I mean, I guess there were some discussions that maybe by Q2 or Q3 there might be a little bit of a chop, but I was wondering what's your guys' take on it?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, no. From our perspective, we're seeing that. We've had China in in our full-year guidance at just 1% growth. Clearly, Q4 was strong, Q1 was stronger than that. We do start to see it catch up to itself, though, obviously, as the year goes on, particularly lapping in Q3 and Q4. We see China market growth actually turning negative in Q4, down a percent to finish at sort of that 1% for the year, but clearly tailing off from here. But that's been in our guidance from the beginning. It's how we're running the business, and it's what we're seeing on the ground for the most part.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. Great. Thank you so much.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Great. Congrats on the quarter and spin, and thanks for taking my question.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Good morning.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. I understand you think the Powertrain business and internal combustion efficiency boosting in general is secularly aligned. I heard you say today that you thought maybe Powertrain could grow something like 6% versus the industry, which is forecast by IHS to grow more like 2%. But is part of the logic behind the spin just the idea that there do exist in the market these debates about the leverage of the Powertrain business, the secular trends within the industry, whereas there really are no debates about the alignment of the E\/EA and E&S businesses? And so this transaction would allow the multiple of the RemainCo to fully reflect the potential of the fastest-growing parts of the business, including autonomous driving, which now rises materially as a percent of total revenue?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, Ryan, listen. I think \u2013 again, I want to go back to we strongly believe that there's significant growth above vehicle production that sits within the powertrain spaces where we operate. We are very confident of that. We have no doubts. Our view of the concern about the demise of the internal combustion engine, our view is in 2025, 95% of powertrains are going to be ICE, right? With some electrification, with some amount of EVs. And there's tremendous opportunity for growth and profitability serving all those various categories.","We think as regulations get increasingly more stringent, especially in Europe and China, the reality is the acceleration of technologies serving those spaces is going to increase, and technology development is going to have to be more rapid. Having said that, and it gets to the capital allocation question, there is a view among investors about the value of a Powertrain dollar of earnings versus some of the other businesses we're in. And we believe that having these separate, having more flexibility to decide where investment is made and takes place, possibly having a slightly different makeup of shareholders, results in incremental value at the end of the day for the existing Delphi shareholder base.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just lastly from me, we can see clearly the relative margin of the three current businesses. But could you also talk about \u2013 and how would you rate on a relative basis the three businesses' current returns on invested capital and cash generation?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. I mean, today when you look at cash generation and return on capital per dollar of revenue, the two highest are in our Electrical Architecture and our Electronics and Safety business. Right? E&S is principally software related. We're working to make that or create more of a software model within that E&S business. Electrical Architecture is \u2013 I think you all know, a portion of that business is very high-margin high-growth connectors and engineered components. The other component is electrical architecture, which isn't quite as high margin, but has very little capital expense related to it and therefore is a big cash generator.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys. I, surprisingly, still have some questions on the spin. I mean, I would imagine you can't comment on specific rumors, but you ran a full process of potentially thinking about a sale or spin here and just came up with the best economic outcome for shareholders, right?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Well, we evaluated all alternatives, right? And came up with the conclusion that, to your point, this was the right path to go down to drive value for shareholders and to position the business to best serve our customers.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then if we think about the RemainCo, and you keep calling it the RemainCo and not Delphi, which I find interesting. Is there a potential to change the name and rebrand the core RemainCo company something else? And do you think by doing this you might get access to capital at a much lower cost? Because we're seeing some of these new auto tech companies get almost free capital. I mean, would you potentially consider raising capital at lower cost to grow the business in that RemainCo?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Well, listen, with respect to names, we actually really like the Delphi name. But, having said that, we're going through a whole process now to determine where it best fits, and evaluating are there other naming alternatives, whether it sits with the Powertrain business or the RemainCo business.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then potential for capital at lower cost on this new branded company?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Well, if the capital is free \u2013 you mentioned free capital \u2013 I guess that I'd be supportive of. I think, with respect to raising other capital, I think Joe would have to go through a cost-of-capital analysis and weigh that versus what some of the options are in terms of deploying it. Joe, do you ... ?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, John, we're not certainly at that point yet. I think, as I mentioned, we expect RemainCo to maintain its investment-grade rating, and much beyond that we really haven't worked through.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just lastly, the earnings in the first quarter were particularly strong, yet you kept the full-year guidance largely the same. Is there anything out there that is kind of bugging you or concerning you that would lead you not to raise the guidance? Or is this just steady as you go and relative conservatism?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, I think steady as you go. It's early in the year, right? We feel from a flat \u2013 forecasting a flat market and planning to that has benefited us in terms of just how we deploy our capital, how we manage our costs, and allow us to flow a little stronger to the extent there is volume pickup. But it's steady as you go. And it's awful early in the year. I think from a \u2013 again, we feel comfortable with our flat forecast. I think what we're looking at, obviously, keep an eye on inventory levels, although what we're seeing at the moment, those seem to be building ahead of summer shutdowns and some model transitions. Also watching just the continued pass car\/SUV mix and what's happening with pass car, particularly North America. So keeping an eye on those, but again, within our expectations at the moment based on our original forecast.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you for ...","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","If I can go back to a prior question asked, I'm a little bit \u2013 and you didn't ask it, John \u2013 but a little bit remiss with respect to cash flow profile of our businesses. I didn't mention the Powertrain business. The reality is, although that is a business that has the optics (55:43) of being much more capital intensive given the nature of the product and the manufacturing process, it's a business, from a cash generation standpoint, that actually does a very good job. From a return-on-capital standpoint, it's a bit lower than what we have at E&S and E\/EA, but still solid returns on invested capital and RONA. So.","John Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you, and good morning.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Good morning, David.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Maybe we just follow up there on this flat production, just given where we are with inventories in North America and effectively China as well. The sales environment, it's a little bit slower than what I think most folks were thinking about and inventories continue to pile up. I think we've seen some announced production shutdowns for the summer so far, and maybe we need a little bit more. I mean, is flat really still the right way to be looking at this right now?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Well, listen. Let's dissect your question a little bit. In terms of the guidance that we give to Wall Street, the evaluation of the puts and takes, whether it be North America, China, South America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, yeah, we think it's the right way to look at it. With respect to how we operate our business and how we're always positioned, listen, you've heard Joe say this before. We're always aggressively attacking our cost structure to make it more variable, to make it more flexible, to put it in a better position, so that to the extent there is any softening in vehicle production that it's something that we can absorb. Joe?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, no, David, we often answer the revenue or the market question with the cost question first. I mean, we've been very focused on, really from late last year on a flat market, and what are the implications of that from a cost perspective? And we continue to maintain that discipline internally. We'll obviously even be more focused on it now just given the spin-off, but we tend to focus on, first and foremost, on where that cost structure needs to be to maintain our margin expansion and EPS growth commitments in what we're now viewing as a flat market. Certainly to the extent that things change, those market concerns materialize, we'd go to what we do very well, which is managing that cost structure","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, understood. That's helpful. If I think about it from a European standpoint, light duty diesel, we saw the declines in sales in the first quarter. Have the production schedules from your OEM partners changed to reflect that? And I ask this question because what they were producing in the first quarter wasn't necessarily reflective of what they were selling. So as a result is there a catch-up, a little bit more of an air pocket for diesel production in the second quarter to get those inventories in line? Or are we not thinking about that the right way?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Well, listen, when you think about production schedules, we get production schedules that are 30 to 60 days out with some adjustment at the front end. So I would tell you, at least as it relates to the first few months of the second quarter, those would reflect their current situation as it relates to inventory and their outlook for sales.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. And we have Europe forecasted as a down quarter on a year-over-year basis anyway, so we're not seeing anything beyond that.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And I guess then just lastly from me on the Powertrain business, as we think about the competitive dynamic going forward, can you remind us what the current annual price-downs within that business is today on your product lines? And then, again, how competitive you think the go-forward is going to be from a incremental CapEx and R&D perspective that needs to be spent within the business to pivot it further into 48 volts all the way through battery electric vehicles?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. Sure. We'll talk about that. It's a business that price-downs average between 1.5% and 2%. So from a pricing standpoint, it's well-positioned. From a portfolio standpoint, this business is very focused on serving those areas where there's only, quite frankly, a handful of suppliers that serve that market. And the business works real hard to have technologies that are better than the technologies of its competitors. From an engineering standpoint, our Powertrain business spends about 10% of sales, so there's an engineering-intensive aspect of that business. Today that encompasses a lot of the power electronics that we're selling today and under development right now. Liam and team will evaluate, just as they do now, the trade-offs between more investment and where they can offset it in their cost structure to maintain and continue to expand margins. And we'll talk about that more at the Investor Day in the fall.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thank you very much for the time.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Stover from SIG. Your line is open.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Thanks very much for -","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions, and just I guess a riff off of two previously asked questions. First is on the cap structure. Typically on a dividend spin situation like this, we would think that the leverage on the SpinCo would be high. Now, the business, as you just referenced, Kevin ...","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","... has terrific returns, but it has a high operating leverage and capital requirement.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","And so how should we think about that capital structure for that business, given where we are in the cycle relative to sort of normal-course behavior?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yes. Well, listen \u2013 and Joe can give more specifics. Again, this business will have a capital structure that positions it and allows it to continue to invest and grow the business. So I'd start with that. At the end of the day, that is how it's going to be positioned. I guess we could debate a little bit what is high, but in this industry \u2013 and all of us familiar with the industry \u2013 I think we'd be at a fairly tight band on what we consider high. Joe, why don't you -","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, no. Matt, like I said, we're obviously still working through that. Some of that needed to come sort of post-announcement, just given who all gets involved with that type of planning. But it will be higher than RemainCo's.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Yeah.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","But at this point we haven't set an exact level. But, to Kevin's point, I mean, our expectation and our goal is that this business is positioned with a capital structure that allows it to operate effectively, allows it to invest. And that I think from an equity perspective it fits well within its overall weighted average cost of capital.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Okay. And the second question, you've stated \u2013 I just want to make sure I'm clear on this. But if we look at the Powertrain business, it's going to have access to all the products and IP that would enable that business over the long term to compete effectively in a world that has an electrified drivetrain, whether that be hybrid to EV. Is that the correct way to think about this? Or should I be thinking about this in a different way?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Nope.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Nope, that is correct. Yeah, no, as Kevin mentioned, we moved our power electronics business, which is inverters, converters, all that type of technology, into Powertrain from E&S over a year ago.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Yeah.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","I guess a year ago this time. And that business belongs in Powertrain and is going with the spin.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Okay, great. Thanks very much, guys.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks, Matt.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks.","Operator","And I now turn the call back over to the presenters.","Kevin P.

Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Operator","Good morning. My name is Kaila and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Delphi's Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. .","I would now like to turn the call over to Jessica Holscott, Delphi's Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Jessica, you may now begin your conference.","Jessica L. Holscott - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Kaila, and thank you for joining Delphi's first quarter earnings call. To follow along with today's presentation, our slides can be found at delphi.com under the Investor section of the website. Please see slide two for a disclosure on forward-looking statements, which we will be making on today's call. It only reflects Delphi's current view of future financial performance, which may be materially different from our actual performance.","Joining us today will be Kevin Clark, Delphi's CEO and President, and Mark Murphy, our CFO.","As seen on slide three, Kevin will provide an operations update as well as an overview of the quarter, and then Mark will cover the financial results and 2015 outlook in more detail.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks Jessica, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before Mark gets into our financial results, I would like to provide some context around our very solid performance in the first quarter, even when taking into account some of the headwinds we faced.","So let's start with the macro environment on slide five. Western European vehicle production appears to be gaining momentum, and vehicle production in North America and China remained solid, in line with our prior outlook.","The positive outlook for these regions is largely offsetting increased weakness in South America. Other macro factors are helping to counter a portion of the negative translation effect of the weaker euros.","Moving to slide six to touch on our first quarter results, the highlights included strong revenue growth of roughly 6%, record operating income of $472 million and operating margins of 12.4%. And we returned over $310 million of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. With the first quarter complete, we remain confident in our full year outlook, which includes accelerating revenue growth reaching 8% for the full year, that's roughly six points over market, operating margin expansion of 70 basis points and EPS growth of roughly 10%.","A significant portion of our revenue growth during the first quarter can be attributed to the increased content on the vehicle platforms shown on slide seven. Our Electrical Architecture segment benefited from increased content on Ford's CV4 platform which includes the Edge and Land Rover's D8 platform which includes Discovery and Discovery Sport. Revenues in our Powertrain segment were partially driven by gas and diesel fuel systems content on the VW Golf. And our Electronic and Safety segment benefited from a range of Active Safety, Body Security, Infotainment and sensor systems on the Cadillac Escalade, the Volvo XC90 and the Audi Q7.","Moving to slide eight, Delphi's recent coast-to-coast drive with our automated vehicle served as a valuable next step in testing our technology. The car traveled roughly 3400 miles through 15 states, 99% of that distance was automated. We collected roughly three terabytes of data during the trip, giving us key insights into our technology and software algorithm that will accelerate future product development, and ultimately enable the further democratization of automated driving features. The drive was really a tremendous effort from the Delphi engineering team; and importantly, it generated significant increased interest from our customers across the globe that we believe will translate into increased demand for automated driving features and a significant increase in vehicle content.","More on the China market on slide nine. We just returned from the Shanghai Auto Show. The size and scale of the show continues to grow and really underscores how serious the largest and fastest growing market in the world is about the automotive industry. Both our global and local customers remain confident that the China market will continue to drive growth in global vehicle production for the foreseeable future. And we left the Shanghai Auto Show even more optimistic regarding improved vehicle mix. A great example of this is the increased demand for SUVs as well as continued growth in content per vehicle.","Now, given the scale and maturity of our local design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, we believe we are very well-positioned to provide the safe, green and connected technologies that are in demand by consumers in the China market.","Moving to our bookings for the quarter on slide 10, which came in at roughly $10 billion. That's an increase of almost $6 billion over the prior year. Awards during the quarter included a wire harness award for a major Japanese OEM, a GDi award from Chengdon in (5:26) China, and an infotainment award from Fiat Chrysler for multiple North American platforms.","This quarter's booking performance puts us solidly on the path to exceed our 2014 bookings amount. The right side of the chart reflects the geographic mix of our first quarter bookings. A few larger awards in North America have skewed the regional mix, but we expect future bookings will continue to reflect our revenue rotation to a more balanced regional distribution.","Moving to slide 11. During the quarter, we continued our track record of executing a balanced and disciplined capital allocation plan to drive shareholder value. We expect to close on the sale of our Thermal division to MAHLE during the third quarter, allowing us to further focus our portfolio on our higher growth, higher margin and higher return Electrical Architecture, Powertrain and Electronics and Safety segments. We plan to use the cash proceeds from the transaction to fund acquisitions and repurchase shares.","Summarizing the quarter on slide 12, we had another great quarter marked by solid revenue and earnings growth, which gives us significant confidence in our revenue and earnings outlook for the balance of the year and positions us to continue to drive significant shareholder value.","So with that, I will turn it over to Mark for a more detailed look at our performance in the quarter. Mark?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will cover the first quarter in greater detail, and then discuss second quarter and full year guidance. Consistent with prior calls, today's review of our actual and forecasted financials exclude restructuring and special items. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP is included at the back of this presentation and the press release.","With the announced sale of our Thermal operation, the entire Thermal business has been reclassified for all periods presented and reflected as discontinued operations. My review will address the continuing operations at Delphi.","Slide 14 provides a snapshot of our first quarter financial performance. Reported revenue totaled $3.8 billion, up 6% on an adjusted basis, which is four points over market. First quarter operating income increased to a record $472 million and operating margins expanded 50 basis points to 12.4%. Earnings per share increased 4% to $1.21 or approximately 15% excluding the effects of currency and commodities. Lastly, operating cash flow totaled $121 million, up from last year despite currency headwinds. As Kevin said, during the quarter we also returned over $310 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Slide 15 provides greater detail on revenue. Revenue of $3.8 billion reflects over $300 million of year-over-year currency and commodity headwinds, mostly offset by strong underlying volume growth. In Europe, strong Powertrain volume growth was partially offset by the anticipated roll off of certain programs in the Electrical Architecture division and continued pruning of reception systems and mechatronics products in our Electronics and Safety business.","With program launches across all segments, we project Europe growth to strengthen through the year to high single digits or more in the second half. North America adjusted revenue increased roughly 7% or four points over market, due principally to Electrical Architecture and Powertrain. Growth in Asia remained strong at 15%, driven by strong growth in China on content growth and share gain. South America was down on continued macroeconomic weakness.","Slide 16 logs (9:30) the year-over-year change in operating income to $472 million. Operating margins expanded 50 basis points year-over-year to 12.4%, primarily due to volume leverage and continued productivity gains.","Slide 17 covers our segments. On an adjusted basis, Electrical Architecture's revenue increased 6% with strong growth in North America and Asia. Powertrain launches of gas and diesel programs drove growth of 7% excluding currency.","Electronics & Safety was flat, due in part to the previously mentioned rationalization in mechatronics and reception systems. Based on product launches in Active Safety and Infotainment we expect Electronics & Safety growth to accelerate in the second half.","With respect to operating margins, Powertrain expanded 160 basis points on volume leverage, while Electronics & Safety expanded 60 basis points due principally to operating performance. Electrical Architecture margins remained strong at roughly 13%.","Turning to slide 18, earnings per share grew 4% due to operating earnings growth and share repurchases. Excluding currency and commodity effects, EPS growth was approximately 15%. Taxes were in line with expectations at 17%.","Slide 19 provides our full-year guidance assumptions. We expect global vehicle production growth of 1% to 2%. By region, we assumed 3% growth in North America. We expect vehicle production in Europe to be up roughly 1%. In China, we expect 7% growth. In South America, we're now forecasting production being down 10%. Our guidance assumes a $1.10 euro rate.","Our second quarter and full year guidance is on slide 20. For the year, we expect revenues of $15.3 billion to $15.7 billion, an 8% adjusted growth rate or roughly six points over market.","We are maintaining OI guidance of $1.98 billion to $2.08 billion. As mentioned during Investor Day due to the divestment of our Thermal business, we expect EPS to be near the low end of our guidance range.","For the quarter, we expect revenues of $3.825 billion to $3.925 billion reflecting growth of five points over market. We expect operating income in the range of $500 million to $520 million, and EPS of $1.27 to $1.37. In line with the full year, we expect the second quarter tax rate to be 17%.","In summary, it was a solid start to the year. In the first quarter we grew 4% over market, and expanded operating margins 50 basis points. For the year, we project growth over market to expand across all segments with consolidated operating margins expanding 70 basis points. Despite currency, our profit outlook remains intact, and our cash flow outlook remains strong.","Kaila, at this point we would like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning everybody. I had a couple of questions. It looks like first of all on the slide where you showed the EBIT bridge that you had something like a 36% conversion on volume, was there anything unusual in that number? Obviously it's quite a bit higher than the traditional 30% that you've been guiding to.","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Why don't I start with some context and Mark you can touch on the numbers. I think as we've talked about previously, Rod when you look at our Powertrain business where we had very solid growth in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. That profitability in that business tends to flow at a very high level. So as a result, we get a significant amount of incremental flow through on our Powertrain business. I think we also probably got some benefit related to mix within our D&A business. Mark (14:35)?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I would just support that statement. And I would just note, Rod that on a net basis we'll have flow through of closer to 25%. But you are correct on a volume flow through basis we were over 30%.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And your price deflation in the quarter was like 1.5%, is that more characteristic of the businesses ex-Thermal, and the margin effect, FX looks like it's higher than the typical 10% that you had guided to previously.","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Why don't I comment on the pricing level through the quarter? Consistent with what we've talked about in the past we'd expect pricing to be 1.5% to 2%. That continues to be our outlook for the balance of the year. When you look at price downs for Delphi with and without Thermal, in reality they were fairly consistent, price downs in the Thermal business relative to the balance of the Delphi portfolio. As we've talked about in the past, the area where we tend to see the highest level of break downs is in the Electronics & Safety business. And that's just really the nature of the shorter product life cycles and the consumer products nature of that product line. Do you want to cover the second?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","What was your second question, Rod, if you don't mind?","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, you had a pretty good or pretty high impact from the FX, I guess there might be some translational...","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. That's a mix of translational and transactional, so translational, the biggest impact is euro dollar. When look at transactional, there are situations like the Brazilian real, U.S. dollar sort of exposure where in certain circumstances on certain product lines we are importing product into Brazil.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just lastly, I wanted to make sure that we're calibrating properly. What's the -- is the comparison for EBIT in the second quarter of last year ex-thermal something like $5.25?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","You're on what would -- your question is Q2...","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Q2, Q2 of 2014 you know when you've adjusted for Thermal?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","It's $5.20, Rod and it is adjusted for Thermal, correct.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So you are thinking that there's a bit of a decline in the second quarter but then things would accelerate towards the back half?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","There is a decline in the second quarter, but I think you have to look at the FX effect on a year-over-year basis, Mark can you give you the specifics. But the headwind is fairly significant at a $1.10 euro.","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Rod, there's about $60 million of FX headwind in the second quarter. I will note that margins are expanding year-over-year 40 basis points in the second quarter.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. I just wanted to, I guess two questions. One around organic growth and second around kind of industry structure broadly, I can't resist following up on yesterday's conference call with one of your customers.","First on organic growth. It looks like you are saying 500 basis points to 600 basis points. Can you just clarify A, what you are kind of saying in terms of organic growth above the market, I think you're saying 600 basis points now? That seems to be up from the Investor Day and from earlier in the year, your outlook for the year. So I kind of want to get clarification on that, what is driving it? What business units in particular we think we can see that in?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes. So for the quarter growth over market is roughly four points. We see that accelerating through the balance of the year. For the full year we would expect to be roughly six points over market.","You're right that's slightly stronger than what we communicated at the time of the Investor Day. The primary driver of that is quite frankly stronger growth at EA and that's our Electrical Architecture segment and that's both in North America as well as in Europe from a regional standpoint.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And underlying that is platform share or is it more content per platform?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","I think it's more -- it's really more content per platform. So richer products, vehicle mix is driving the increased content.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And second, on the infotainment award, could you give any more color on when your award with Fiat Chrysler might kick in, if that's mid level, high level, what kind of infotainment system that's for to begin?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","It's really across the board so a scalable platform I believe it kicks in about two years out, similar to typical programs within our E&S division. You know as we have talked about in the past you're going -- and Mark mentioned -- you are going to see a significant ramp up in growth in our E&S division beginning in the third quarter of this year.","So you will see significant acceleration and year-over-year growth and ultimately, I think Mark said we will be roughly six points over market within our E&S division for the full year, and roughly operating at market, maybe a little bit above market in the first half, so we see very strong growth.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And sort of on a broader industry strategy question, yesterday the Chairman of Fiat Chrysler had a long conference call, argued return on capital for OEMs was unattractive. We would agree. Argued that there was a lot of redundant Powertrain, Electronic and other R&D and CapEx going on across the OEM industry. We would agree. Then argued that a horizontal consolidation of OEMs was the way to go. We kind of posed the question, but we'd kind of like to pose it to you as well, is there a better solution that would actually have more and more of the modules of the car being outsourced up to the supply chain, e.g. you could not just make engines, but engines. He made the point that who cares what a four-cylinder engine in. He dismissed that as unlikely, but just wondered if you had any points of view on the desirability, if there's any potential to have significant chunks of the R&D and CapEx coming out of OEMs and being shared by a supplier like you?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Listen. We think at the end of the day what we bring to bear is technology and technology capabilities. And the more control, the more involvement in technology, the more value we add. The more integration of systems that we can do, the more value we add. So, our view is net-net that sort of trend would be a positive for suppliers like Delphi.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Any evidence that any of the industry is willing to go that direction?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","No. I think it's wait-and-see. I think the level of that activity really varies by OE. And there are several OEs where there's a fair amount of integration and systematization that's going on, in actuality as well as dialogue about the opportunities to do more.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And could any of the kind of newer rumored entrants, an Apple, Google, both rumored to be doing cars by 2020, go more to sell, call it the Foxconn outsourced approach?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Listen, you know, at the end of the day we think those of us who have been in the industry for a long time that have the capabilities, that understand the automobiles, that know how to integrate it, and do it at a quality level that the OEs need and require is very differentiated, and that is something the industry is going to continue to need.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a first question on Forex. I mean you've been able to keep your operating income outlook largely unchanged even though we've seen a strengthening of the dollar basically versus every other currency out there. I'm just curious if that's purely just math at this point or if there are any significant levers that you've had to pull to really keep your operating income where it is or your outlook where it is? And if you can pull those levers even harder if we see a further strengthening of the dollar?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Listen, we work hard every day from a manufacturing material performance standpoint, you know that. Mark why don't you comment on the specifics?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would just say, John that, from the $1.20 to the $1.10, we had sufficient offsets to maintain our OI guidance, which is what we did. As you know, the euro right now is about $1.12, but if it were to weaken we would have euro translation effects.","We've talked about those before at about a $50 million annualized revenue impact for every euro penny flow at the company margin rate. We would expect to offset part of that effect through operating actions. And then our ability to offset the rest of it really depends on what happens to other currencies and commodities.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. But if we were to think about the dollar versus euro going closer to parity by maybe year-end as rates in the U.S. rise and QE ramps up in Europe, I mean, where do you think you start taking on water. I mean is that -- I know it's a tough question to put an exact point on, but I mean you have room down at $1.05 or parity to have some offsets, or I mean, do you start taking on that $50 million of revenue and 10% margin off of that as we get, dip below $1.10?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah, I'd say $1.10 it starts to get more challenging, below $1.10. We would have some ability to offset but it would get more challenging.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Okay","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I agree","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then the second question, as we think about the three sales at Thermal, really the one that's being completed and then the Shanghai portion and the Korean portion. When do you think you will have an idea of when those will get settled or really the Shanghai and Korean portion?","And as we think about those combined, my understanding is they are roughly one third of the business. So if we are to think about it linearly, you would get about half the revenue \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 half the proceeds that you are getting from the core business that's going to MAHLE. I'm just trying to understand the potential magnitude of the proceeds from the remaining business and the timing on that?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah, you've got to remember -- so timing, the way I would think about timing the Korean joint venture should happen at some point this year. The Chinese joint venture at sometime in 2016. With respect to size, they are not -- from a size and profitability standpoint, they are not half of what we have in the North American and European business. So the dollar value of those transactions would not be half of the $727 million transaction value that we talked about for the U.S., European, and South American business. It'd be significantly less than that.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I mean, roughly what are their sales versus the North American and European business sales?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","I don't want to get into it. I would say the multiple on the earnings would be consistent with what we sold in the U.S. the wholly-owned thermal business.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just lastly, being in Shanghai last week as well, there's a lot of shifts that are going on in that market. And it seems like the domestic players are gaining market share, then the Germans are \u2013 the German lux guys are moving away from the Chinese market a little bit, maybe shifting some of their production, or I'm sure shipping some of their production to the North American market, so there's a lot of moving pieces based on what's going on in China.","I mean, I'm just wondering if you could comment with those potential market share shifts in China as well as some of the German Lux vehicles ending up in North America as opposed to China. What you'd see on content or business potential in China specifically? And those vehicles that are being shipped to the U.S. instead of China potentially if there's any delta in content for what you would provide there?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","No, listen, we came away from China as a management team very, very optimistic. And it's really for two reasons. You know as a back drop to give you some background as you know we supplied both the global OEs there as well as the locals. A disproportionate amount of growth in that region has historically been with the global OEs on heavily content vehicles.","You're absolutely right, the local OEs are starting to increase the quality and increase the content in their vehicle. And as a result appear to be strengthening. The positive for us is we have two things going on. On a relative basis you have strong vehicle production growth in the region. We have the benefit of serving both customer bases. The local OEs we actually do more systems work.","So dollar revenue and profitability tends to be greater when we serve those customers, which is beneficial. But what we are seeing is a significant ramp up in content per vehicle, and that's what really explains the strong growth that we had in the first quarter, we were more than 10 points over market.","We'd expect to be more than 10 points over market for the balance of the year. And when you look at our fastest growing segments in that region it's the E&S division and Powertrain, which really shows the maturing of that market.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So Kevin, would it be fair to say like the Great Wall hobbles (29:33) has significantly more content for you than would a GM and Ford crossover in China?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","You know, I don't know offhand. I would say that they are probably fairly consistent. I would say they're probably fairly close. I don't think I have the specifics for those platforms but I think they would be relatively consistent.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, good morning, everyone.","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Hi, Ravi.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","If I can just follow up on something, Brian Johnson asked earlier about the comments yesterday from Sergio, I don't know if you listened in to that call. If you don't, I strongly recommend it, especially with a glass of whiskey and a cigar in your hand.","But I'm interested in your thoughts on what he said. He was really pushing for significant global OEM consolidation as a means to basically make the industry much healthier. As one of the largest and most powerful suppliers in the industry, what's your view on that? Do you think that's necessary or do you think \u2013 or do you think you're pretty happy with the status quo?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Listen, I think everyone is familiar with this industry is aware that there is a fair amount of overcapacity among the OEs. Right, that is the reality. I think that's something that the OEs need to ferret out, and figure out how they deal with it. I think from our perspective whether there are fewer or not, given volume, given our volume outlook, given what's the trend in terms of the technology that's going into the vehicle and the complexity related to that technology.","Given the amount of integration that needs to go on, suppliers like Delphi who sit in the high tech spaces are in a really good position. So I think -- you know I think at the end of the day we benefit either way and I'm not sure at this point in time I could comment on how that would really change the game for us.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Second question, you mentioned earlier about a wiring harness going into the Japanese OEM I believe. Can you give us any more color on that, what region, what type of vehicle, and whether this kind of shoves open that door that was closed for a long time by the Japanese OEMs?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","No, we talked about -- we've been talking over the last couple of years about one of the great benefits and one of the things that the Thermal division did a great job of was really cracking the door with the Japanese OEs and giving the opportunity for the balance of our businesses to pursue business there.","And we've seen some benefits from that. It's been slower going. It's primarily happening in the North America market and the China market. This specific OE is a well-known OE, the vehicle is a \u2013 I'd characterize it as a mass-market high-volume vehicle for the North American market, and it's a great customer to be working with.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And if I can just ask is it a J3 OEM? Or is it one of the smaller ones?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","It's a J3 OEM.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Pat Archambault from Goldman Sachs.","Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah thank you very much. Good morning. A couple of questions, just clarifications. It's been talked a little bit about but ex currency if I have these numbers right, your first half expectations including what you reported today is about 6%, your full year is about 8%, so that leaves kind of around 10% ex currency growth in the second.","And I think we talked about E&S as being a driver here based on some of the contracts and their timing. Anything else that's supporting that acceleration that you guys are modeling in?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Pat, this is Mark. We're seeing in the second half, we believe all segments will be either high single-digits to low double-digits with the strongest growth that, as you mentioned, being in E&S in the second half","Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And is that just the timing of customer backlog rolling on? Or you know, sort of anything else?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a lot of new programs. So in the case of Powertrain you've got diesel ramp in Europe, you've got GDi ramp in China. In the case of the Electrical Architecture business, you have the ramp of some large programs in Europe. And then as mentioned in the case of Electronics and Safety you have some large Infotainment ramps and Active Safety business in the second half.","Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. And then, talking about electrical distribution. I think you mentioned it but, so pardon if I'm just asking you to repeat stuff. But that was like the one segment which saw a little bit of a margin drag. Can you just talk about sort of what happened there, and the outlook for the year?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I will note that it was solid margins and you know we've got some volume leveraging, and they could have performed a little bit better, but a very strong performance, a few non-recurring items, but overall a very strong quarter, and expect to expand margins in that business through the year.","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yes. I think that's one in the quarter. I think we had a commercial settlement in that quarter that affected margins on a year-over-year basis. And if you eliminated that commercial settlement it's strong margin expansion to Mark's point. We had great volume. We had great manufacturing performance, that's partially offset with a commercial settlement.","Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And that was like a one-time benefit in the first quarter of last year that didn't repeat?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","No. It's actually a cost in this quarter.","Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Any sort of estimate of what that was?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","One time related item roughly $10 million.","Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Last one for me is just on that Europe piece you mentioned it's \u2013 it is getting stronger, and I guess maybe two parts to the question. You guys and everybody else in the quarter, you know generally saw positive growth ex currency, but not quite as positive as what some of the headline sales numbers reported for the market would suggest.","And so I'm just curious, you know why is production appearing to lag a little bit, what we see on the sales side, maybe there's kind of an export market issue there that we need to think about? And how do you assess the upside risk? That's kind of the second part of the question for that particular market where it seems like things are actually coming in better than people thought.","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","And you're speaking about which market in particular? Europe at this point in time?","Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, I guess I should actually mention the market right? Yeah Europe is what I was actually asking about.","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","I like the upside risk up.","Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, it's not Brazil.","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Exactly. Western Europe, at least for us as we look at the market for the first time in a while appears to be getting better, which is an overall positive, I'm sure there's a certain amount of inventory reduction that's going within the network. We will see how long sales continue at a relatively robust rate, and at what point that triggers. Does it trigger incremental production growth? I think if you look at IHS and you look at our build schedules, you know when we originally gave guidance versus where we ended up for the first quarter, production levels actually did end up stronger. I think the question is do they get incrementally stronger? And if they do, we should benefit.","I think then the question is, what is the outlook for Eastern Europe and South America, which in reality, continue to be challenging markets. You know, South America our initial outlook heading into the year was the markets would be flat. Our outlook for the full year is it's now it's going to be down 10% and it was worse than that in the first quarter. And we tell you, looking at it now, we don't see it getting any better for quite a while.","Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. So puts and takes seem fairly evenly balanced. All right, guys. That's all I had. Thank you.","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Operator is there another question?","Operator","Yes. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Galves from Credit Suisse.","Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, good morning. The net performance improvement was well below the pricing headwind in Q1. Is that typical for early in the year? What is your outlook for the remainder of 2015? And what's your assumption for kind of overall incremental margins ex currency for the full year?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Let me make one comment, and then I will turn it over to Mark. I think it's important when you look at year-over-year when you are considering performance just to get a bit of context. So in the first quarter of this year we had over 300 vehicle launches. That's a 50% increase relative to the number of launches that we had last year. It supports all the growth in the back half of the year that Mark talked about. So to give context, I think it's important to have that in mind. Typically yes, what happens is material manufacturing performance is lower in the first quarter and strengthens through the year. Mark?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say that Dan we did have the commercial settlement as well in the first quarter, and if you -- on a go forward basis we do expect performance to meet or beat the price number, and as Kevin said, if you exclude any engineering increases, which we are doing in order to support the growth furthermore you've got performance feeding price (40:55).","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","You know, I think to Mark's point, as we did last year and what we've communicated this year it's our plan to the extent we can certainly meet our financial commitments, there are certain areas that we would like to continue to incrementally invest in the business.","Active Safety, Automated Driving, in and around Powertrain, and we'll invest incrementally in engineering. There's some IT initiatives that we have to better position our business to make it more leverageable on a future basis, so we are looking to make incremental investments in IT as well. So those are discretionary items that we can do to the extent we perform at levels that are acceptable and we can throttle back if the macros cut against us, just like we did last year.","Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's great to know. Thanks. And then just one other sort of housekeeping question. Can you tell us what the share count assumption is within the full year EPS guidance? And just curious, you've been saying that EPS should come in towards the lower end, and it sounds like you are still saying that. Why didn't you just make kind of the low end the midpoint? Just curious about that?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Dan, we set our range and we wanted to maintain \u2013 wanted to maintain \u2013 excuse me \u2013 maintain our range. For share count assumptions, you can assume that we are going to roughly buy back in line with last year. And then we will use a portion of the proceeds of the Thermal transaction for potentially additional buyback. However, for both our routine buyback and that use of proceeds, we may modulate that based on acquisition opportunities.","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah, and Dan, I think the overlay is we'd told people, you know we gave guidance after our Q4 earnings call and on the Investor Day that we would be at the low end of the range. The low end of the range is $5.35. We have confidence in the $5.35 given where the market is, and given how our business is performing. And as a result we wanted to keep that as the low end of the range.","Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, excellent. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets.","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Hey, Joe.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys. This is Jacob Peters (43:36) on for Joe. How are you doing?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good.","Unknown Speaker","I just had a quick question. I'm sorry if I missed this. But could you provide what the Infotainment and Active Safety growth was in the quarter? And also I was just curious what your underlying assumptions are under take rates and if you've seen any acceleration of that since the Toyota announcement that they are going to make essentially a $500 Active Safety in every vehicle.","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","As we have talked about in the past, we think that's beneficial from a penetration rate standpoint. When you look at the quarter and we're affected by timing. Infotainment growth was effectively flat. That's going to accelerate significantly strong double-digit growth rates beginning in Q3, and that ties to some of the program launches that Mark alluded to you earlier. So from an active safety standpoint year-over-year growth in the quarter was roughly 20%. We expect the full year to be roughly 50% growth and that's driven by launching new programs as well as increased penetration.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And I guess on the -- have you seen, I guess, any acceleration since this Toyota announcement, or is it just too early at this point?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","I think it's too early to tell. I think the way we would answer it is, you know we've booked $1 billion of business in 2013 $1.4 billion in 2014. We expect to be well north of a $1 billion this year as we look at the opportunities that are out there. And if you look at that from a book to bill ratio, it is five, six times the level of revenue that we had in 2014. So I think that gives you the order of magnitude in terms of the future growth in this product line.","Unknown Speaker","Yep. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Stover from SIG.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you very much. Most of my questions have been addressed. I did have a couple of sort detailed questions. On the cash flow there was an other outflow of about $52 million, it was a bit unusual versus last year. Is there anything we should be aware of there?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I don't think it's anything major it's just other assets \u2013 other assets other liabilities.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. If we look at the headwind from FX and commodities at 8%, how much of that was commodities?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The bulk of its FX there's a small amount that's commodity.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And if we look at the loss on the disc ops how should we think about the tax treatment of proceeds from the sale of Thermal?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Net-net cash proceeds on the $727 million transaction we should get about $600 million, $650 million.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton from KeyBanc.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning, Brett.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","First it's kind of a conceptual question with regards to margins. Obviously, you're going through a significant ramp up phase in terms of your new product launches and so forth.","At times for various suppliers adding a significant increase in launch activity results in margin compression, yet you are expecting margin expansion through the back half of the year.","The main question I have for you is really twofold. One, what is driving that margin expansion through the back half of the year? Is this more profitable new business? Or is it just operating leverage?","And then secondly, as far as risk is concerned, how would you address an investors concern that maybe higher launch activity might result in increased risk? You certainly have been successful over the past years in terms of ramping up. But how do we think about that?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","If I can answer the second and Mark can address the first. I think -- listen I think in reality, higher launch activity does create incremental risk for the enterprise. But that's something that we deal with and we operate with, and we do well day-in and day-out. And if you look at the level of launches beginning in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and on, the reality is each and every year we had an increased amount of launch activity, and we've dealt with it well. We execute extremely well, and we are confident that we have our arms around it as we look at the launches in 2015. Mark, do you want to address the risk?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would agree certainly, Kevin. It's just fundamentally operating discipline helps us manage the risk. We're also as Kevin mentioned earlier, increasing our engineering spend to manage the risk. And then we have projected steady margin expansions over the next several years related to this increased volume growth in all segments. Sticking with what we said at Investor Day, we are expecting 14% operating margins across each segment, a combination of just the volume contribution and the continued operating discipline and associated productivity improvements.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then you've mentioned a couple of times on the call -- switching gears -- M&A and the potential for some bolt-on acquisitions. And my simple question is, right now what's the pipeline look like and what do you think the probability of doing an acquisition maybe in 2015 might be? And size wise would you consider it to be more of a bolt-on versus maybe something of an order of magnitude of $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion or something like that?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Listen I think the pipelines \u2013 I think the pipeline is \u2013 remains robust. I think by the end of the year I can say with a very high level of confidence whether they're acquisitions or investments, we'll be making a number of those in high technology software areas, so we've been very, very active in that space in and around Powertrain, in and around Electronics and Safety, Infotainment and Connected Car, Active Safety, so highly confident.","In addition to that, our funnel include some larger transactions that \u2013 transactions that I would say from a transaction value would range from $1 billion to $3 billion-ish from an overall mix of potential opportunities. I would say, the larger ones are always a little bit more difficult to predict. I would say, as we look at calendar year 2015, it's a greater than 50\/50 probability that we complete something.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then the \u2013 as far as the larger ones is concerned, would that just be consistent with your existing portfolio or is there the possibility of you expanding materially outside of your existing portfolio of product?","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Consistent with what we've talked about before, our focus area is really augmenting the existing product portfolio that we have, either strengthening it, in product areas where we're not quite as strong, or areas that we are strong and may not have the customer presence, adding on transactions that enhance our customer geographic.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Excellent. Thank you very much gentlemen.","Kevin P. Clark - Chief Executive Officer and President","Welcome.","Operator","That is the end of our Q&A session, I will now hand the call back over to Jessica Holscott for any closing remarks.","Jessica L.

My name is Lisa, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Delphi's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jack Monti, Delphi's Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may now begin your conference.","Jack Monti","Thank you, Lisa, and thanks so much, everyone, for joining Delphi's first quarter earnings call. To follow on with today's presentation, our slides can be found at delphi.com under the Investors section of the website. Please see Slide 2 for disclosure on forward-looking statements, which we'll be making on today's call and only reflect Delphi's current view of future financial performance, which may be materially different from our actual performance.","Joining today's call will be Rod O'Neal, Delphi's CEO and President; and Kevin Clark, our CFO. As seen on Slide 3, Rod O'Neal will begin the call with an overview of our first quarter, followed by Kevin Clark, who will review our financial performance in greater detail, discuss our 2013 outlook, and then open the line for Q&A. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rod.","Rodney O'Neal","Thank you, Jack, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our performance in Q1, especially in light of the challenges we all faced in Europe.","So if you move to Slide 5, you'll see that, as expected, we had a very, very solid quarter. I'd like to share some of the highlights with you. We had adjusted earnings of $1.07 per share compared to $1.05 last year. We continued our initiatives to further optimize our cost structure and expand margins. We continue to invest in our bright future by increasing our investment in advanced engineering to support the development of new technologies in the areas of safety and interconnect.","We also bought back $122 million of stock in the first quarter. Now this brings our total share repurchases to just over $0.5 billion in the last 12 months, though $1 billion in total has been authorized by our Board of Directors. We also initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.17 a share that amounts to a little over $200 million of capital returned to our shareholders each year. So these combined activities show that our management team remains laser-focused in increasing shareholder value, even in this very challenging environment.","Turning to Slide 6. This slide shows validation of our ability to execute flawlessly as we continue to receive accolades from our customers for achieving their expectations on quality, delivery and launch. As you look at the chart, you'd see a diverse group of customers who have recognized us with awards in the last quarter. It's also important to note the number of awards from our Chinese customers. That region is very important to our growth strategy, so recognition from our customers there is very, very key to our success. So all of these awards reinforce that Delphi's providing customers with advanced, game-changing technologies the consumers want, which brings us to Slide 7.","I'm extremely proud to share that Delphi recently won another prestigious PACE Award and was finalist for 3 other products. We won with our game-changing common rail for heavy duty diesel. Now this award highlights our commitment to providing leading-edge technical solutions for the marketplace. Delphi now has 16 PACE Awards, more than any other company which is testament to the culture of innovation the team embodies.","Moving to Slide 8. Coming off of a record year in new bookings, last year in 2012, we're off to a great start in 2013, and we expect this trend to continue. In Q1, we received bookings from key customers that include a Nissan award for electrical architecture in North America, a Honda award for flex engine management systems in South America, a Renault award for radar camera system in Europe. We won a significant electrical architecture win in China. And we won a major award for our GDi technology in North America. So for the last 17 quarters, we generated almost $90 billion in bookings. As you can see from the pie chart, in Q1, we continued to increase the geographic diversification of our business with Asia representing 34% of the bookings.","So before I turn it over to Kevin, let me go to Slide 9. And to sum it up, we have great products and I have a great management team that executes flawlessly. Our priorities for the future, well, they remain unchanged, and they are focused on creating value for the customer and for the shareholder.","We will achieve disciplined revenue growth. We will further optimize our European footprint and relocated to lower cost countries. We will continue to delight our customers with award-winning technologies. We will further expand margins and increase earnings per share, and we will continue to deploy capital in a very disciplined manner. I'm extremely optimistic about the future of Delphi. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin who will cover the numbers. Kevin?","Kevin P. Clark","Thanks, Rod. Good morning, everyone. As Jack mentioned, I will begin by covering our first quarter result, and then provide second quarter and full year guidance. In order to provide a clear view into the underlying fundamentals for the business, today's review of the actual and forecasted results will exclude all restructuring and other nonrecurring cost. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are included at the back of both the press release as well as this presentation, for your reference.","So let me start on Slide 11 with a snapshot of our first quarter financial performance which, as Rod already mentioned, was in line with our expectations and impacted by continued weakness in the European market, most notably for us in Western Europe, as well as the continued slowdown in the global commercial vehicle market. Despite this challenging environment that impacted revenue, we delivered very solid EBITDA and operating margins as well as earnings per share growth.","Reported revenue totaled $4 billion. It's down 1.7%. If you adjust for foreign exchange, commodities, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue has actually declined 6%. As I mentioned, the weakness in European production continued to be a significant headwind across each of our segments, resulting in a 17% decline in European revenues versus an IHS estimate of 9% reduction in European light vehicle production, which includes a 14% decline in Western European production. However, as a result of our lean cost structure and continued very strong operating execution, we delivered very solid double-digit EBITDA margins in Europe and  consolidated EBITDA margins of 14%.","During the quarter, net income totaled $336 million, and earnings per share was $1.07. It's up almost 2% on lower revenues.","Lastly, free cash flow totaled a negative $56 million. That is down from the prior year as a result of lower EBITDA, increased restructuring spend and dividend payments received from joint ventures in the prior period.","So with that as a backdrop, let's move to Slide 12, and I'll review our first quarter revenue in more detail. As I mentioned, our reported revenue declined 1.7% to just over $4 billion. Volume and mix, principally in our powertrain and E&S segments, resulted in a decline of $207 million or 5%. Foreign exchange and commodity prices created a $14 million headwind, or roughly 30 basis points, to our growth rate. Price downs were 1.3%, slightly below our forecasted range of 1.5% to 2% annually. And acquisitions net of divestitures added $207 million of revenue or 5 points to our growth rate.","If you look at our revenue on a regional basis, as I mentioned earlier, European revenues were down 17%, the result of continued weakness in light vehicle production vehicle production, further impacted by a labor disruption at one of our OE assembly plants in Belgium during the quarter, as well as the continued decline in commercial vehicle production.","Asia was our fastest-growing region where revenues increased 8%. Within that region, our revenues in China increased 11%, primarily the result of favorable customer mix.","Revenues in North America declined 2%, primarily due to lower production by our largest customer in the region on key platforms, including the full-size truck, the slowdown in commercial vehicle market as well as continued weakness in the automotive aftermarket.","And then lastly, in South America, revenues increased 7% year-over-year due to an increase in vehicle production, as well as customer mix, which also translated into an acceleration of our sequential growth.","Slide 13 reconciles the year-over-year change in EBITDA. For the quarter, EBITDA totaled $562 million, reflecting the negative effect of lower revenue and less favorable product mix principally in Europe, price downs, foreign exchange, an increased investment in advanced engineering, partially offset by very strong material and manufacturing performance, as well as a reduction in SG&A spend, benefits from the MVL acquisition and lower long-term incentive compensation expense. EBITDA margins declined 30 basis points to 14%.","Slide 14 include our segment results. Electrical architecture's adjusted revenue, which excludes the impact of MVL, totaled just over $1.7 billion, that's down 1% from the prior year period, driven by a double-digit decline in European revenues, almost entirely offset by a single-digit growth in North America and very strong double-digit growth in both Asia and South America.","Segment EBITDA totaled $285 million, representing 14.8% EBITDA margins. That's up 40 basis points from the prior year, primarily the result of the MVL acquisition and strong material and manufacturing performance, partially offset by investments in engineering and information systems as well as the OpEx impact of a stronger Mexican peso.","Revenue in our powertrain segment totaled just over $1.1 billion. That's down 12%, reflecting a double-digit decline in European revenues, as a result of continued weakness in the light vehicle and commercial vehicle markets and the related unfavorable product mix. And mid-single digit declines in both North and South America, reflecting customer mix and weakness in the automotive aftermarket, partially offset by sound revenue growth in Asia.","Segment EBITDA margins declined 140 basis points to 14.6%, reflecting lower revenues, principally in Europe, and a related lower sales of higher margin, diesel fuel injection systems, as well as increased investment in advanced engineering.","In our electronics and safety segment, revenue totaled just under $700 million. It represents a 7% reduction from the prior period, principally the result of lower revenues in Europe and North America. Segment EBITDA margins declined 40 basis points to 13%, a result of lower revenues, increased investment in engineering as well as the timing of engineering rebuilds, primarily offset by strong manufacturing and material performance.","Thermal revenues declined 8% driven by a double-digit decline in European revenues and a mid-single digit decline in North America, partially offset by very strong growth in Asia. EBITDA margins increased on a sequential basis, over 200 basis points to 6.9%, or down 120 basis points versus the prior year period, the result of lower volumes, partially offset by benefits from recent restructure initiatives.","Turning to Slide 15. Earnings per share increased to $1.07, driven by lower revenues, the impact of increased depreciation and amortization, the negative effect of foreign exchange, more than offset by accretion related to the MVL acquisition and benefits associated with a lower tax rate, roughly 11% in the quarter versus 18% in the prior year as well as share repurchases.","Moving to cash flow on Slide 16. We continue to do a great job converting earnings into cash flow. Q1 cash flow reflected the normal seasonality of our business and the associated investment in working capital, as well as lower EBITDA and increased restructuring expense. Over the last 12 months, we generated over $2.1 billion of EBITDA, which was converted into over $1.3 billion of operating cash flow, which we use to fund organic growth initiatives, dividend and share repurchases. To drive further shareholder value, we used balance sheet cash and raised debt to acquire MVL, which continued to deliver very solid financial results.","As we outlined in our recent Analyst Day, the disciplined long-term allocation of capital remains a top priority. On a normalized basis, we expect operating cash flow to average roughly 75% to 80% of EBITDA. We'll continue to use 35% to 40% of our operating cash flow for CapEx, 2\/3 of which will support growth initiatives, 10% to 15% will fund our dividend program and the balance will fund opportunistic share repurchases and strategic M&A.","Turning to Slide 17. We highlight the strength of our cash flow conversion relative to our peer group. On an LTM basis, our operating cash flow, a percent of sales, is 10%, and free cash flow, as a percent of net income, was roughly 88%, reflecting industry-leading metrics.","Moving to Slide 18. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with solid investment grade metrics, applying multiple levers that continue to drive shareholder value. Balance sheet cash totaled $834 million and total debt outstanding increased slightly, reflecting working capital seasonality, restructuring spend, dividend payments and $122 million of share repurchases during the quarter.","Net debt was just over $1.6 billion, roughly 0.8x LTM EBITDA. And as you can see, following our capital market activity in the first quarter, we have no meaningful debt maturities until 2018. And total liquidity remained very strong at over $2.3 billion.","Moving to Slide 19 to talk about our restructuring program. We increased the size of our restructuring program from the $300 million we discussed at our Q4 call to $375 million. We continue to optimize our cost structure by rotating our manufacturing and engineering footprints to lower cost regions and further streamlining administrative functions. Our activities continue to remain largely targeted at high cost Western Europe, which comprises over 80% of total restructuring spend and almost the entire increase to announce the amount of initial restructuring program. We expect savings of $80 million in 2013, which includes MVL synergies and approximately $200 million of cumulative benefits in 2014.","Now Slide 20 details some of the assumptions underlying our 2013 guidance. Based on several sources, including customer schedules and IHS, we're forecasting global production of just over 86 million units, a slight increase versus our prior forecast and just under a 2% increase with the current IHS estimate for 2012 production. Our current forecast assumes a 3% increase in year-over-year North American production, a 2-point improvement from our prior forecast. However, year-over-year production for our largest customer in the region is now forecast to be down over 0.5%, a one point deterioration from our prior forecast.","Production in China market is now forecasted to increase 10% versus the prior year, roughly 0.5 increase from our prior outlook. We're forecasting European production of just over 19 million units. That's a slight increase from our prior forecast from roughly a 5% decline in year-over-year production versus the current IHS estimate for 2012. It's important to note that this forecast assumes Western European production to be down almost 7%, a slight deterioration versus our prior outlook.","Stepping back considering the various puts and takes in each region that affects Delphi, we believe the overall impact of current forecast for global production and our prior outlook for revenue is really negligible.","So turning to Slide 21 to discuss our 2013 guidance. In total, our outlook remains largely unchanged and reflects a more balanced mix of revenue and profitability between the first and second half of the year. We continue to effect full year revenues in the range of $16.2 billion to $16.6 billion, full year EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $2.325 billion to $2.425 billion with EBITDA margins in the range of 14.4% to 14.6%.","We continue to expect a tax rate of 16% for the full year, and we've increased our EPS guidance slightly, reflecting a share count of 314 million for the year, in the range of 4.15% to 4.41%. And cash flow before financing will total $1 billion with CapEx expected to be roughly $750 million.","Turning to the second quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $4.15 billion to $4.25 billion, reflecting roughly a 4% increase on a sequential basis, primarily the result of an increase in a number of production days in the quarter. EBITDA will be in the range of $600 million to $630 million representing EBITDA margins of 14.5% to 14.8%, and EPS will be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15, assuming 340 million shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of 108% in the quarter. So with that, we'd like to open the line up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just want to go in a couple of segments in terms of the margin trends. In Powertrain, how much of a drag was the CV fall-off and kind of as you look to the full year, given your production forecast, are you looking for any recovery there?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. As it relates to the impact of the CV fall-off, I think, Brian, as you know, the forecast for the first quarter or the actual results for the first quarter of commercial vehicle market globally was down roughly 12%, Europe slightly less than that -- or 12% North America, slightly less than that in Europe. As you know, we have a heavy duty diesel product within our Powertrain segment. So any slowdown in that segment does have a material impact on product mix, revenue and inherent profitability in that segment. As we look at the full year, we expect the commercial vehicle market in North America and Europe to continue to be down in Q2, but for the balance of the year, in Q3 and Q4 to actually improve and we'd expect that commercial vehicle market globally to be up in the mid-single digits for the full year.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And on E&S, you warned us last quarter not to extrapolate margins out. Can you give us any more color, just given the software intensive nature of engineering, intensive nature of the business, on the seasonal pace of engineering, recoveries and, hence, margins on that unit? Or it just depends when there's no seasonality?","Kevin P. Clark","There's a little bit of seasonality in terms of weighing. There tends to be more engineering rebuilds and recoveries in the fourth quarter versus the balance of the year. However, depending on specific development programs with specific customers, there is variability between quarter-to-quarter throughout the year.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And in terms of a range of variabilities, at plus or minus a couple hundred basis points? Or is there...","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, a couple hundred basis points is reasonable.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple things. One is, just -- your prior guidance suggested that you'd start with EBITDA margins in the 13.2% to 13.5% range and then accelerate the average 14.4% to 14.6%. And presumably, there were a few things that you did not anticipate that gave you that -- a much higher start in the 14% range. Could you talk a little bit about what those were? And in that context, you didn't raise the full year, you sort of de-risking the year or is it possible that there are a few elements here that are coming in better-than-expected?","Kevin P. Clark","Well, I would say, the primary driver, as it relates to Q1, is we had more volume relative to our prior guidance, which we efficiently generated EBITDA. And so $75 million more in revenue, if you take a look at the midpoint of our guidance for Q1, which translated into $25 million of EBITDA. So I think that was the real driver, slightly better build schedules primarily in Asia. As you look at the balance of the year, I do the mix of 2 things, Rod. I think it's one, we're very committed to hitting the guidance that we've laid out or committed to you folks. It's a relief  -- we, from a management standpoint, haven't really seen a catalyst as it relates to Europe to get confidence if that market has actually improved. And third, to quite to be candid, to the extent that we do see healing in the market and we do see stronger revenues, we're going to use a portion of that stronger revenue to basically invest in the business, further invest in the business and growth initiatives and systems investment.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And pricing for the longest time has been ranging from 1.5% to 2%. I think it was 1.8% in the fourth quarter, but it seems to be moderating. Is there anything unusual here or sustainable about this lower level?","Kevin P. Clark","We're still very confident that it's, for us, price downs will average 1.5% to 2% on an annual basis and there's a little bit of seasonality within any given year based on launch timing of certain programs.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, obviously, there's been some media reports suggesting that you guys are may be in the running for a fairly sizable acquisition in electronics. Could you give us some thoughts on what the vision is there, what would be attractive as far as acquisitions you might be considering? And whether or not that might have an effect on your capital deployment plans?","Kevin P. Clark","Well, we don't comment on specific M&A items, as you can imagine. However, what we have said is, strategically, we're interested in areas that are in and around Powertrain electronics, that if we're to do M&A transaction, they're transactions that are accretive to our earnings growth, accretive to our margins and are effectively bolt-on from an integration standpoint. So from a strategy standpoint, nothing's changed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a first question and clarification on the guidance. There are not additional share buybacks there encompassed in your core EPS guidance, is that correct?","Kevin P. Clark","That is correct, sure.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And second question on CapEx, a little bit lower than needs -- the quarterly average run rate that you'd expect going through the course of the year. I'm sure there's some                                          seasonality that works in there. But we heard from some other suppliers that there have been some program delays. Just curious, if your CapEx is being impacted by that and if you are seeing program delays from -- it sounds like a broad swath of automakers are pushing back some programs. Just curious to  -- if there's any correlation there or what you're seeing on delays?","Rodney O'Neal","No. There's nothing material in our CapEx number that's -- in terms of the customer moving things out. I think we're just seeing is this -- is that in the noise of the macros, we try just to be a little bit more judicial around what it is we're doing in terms of capital spend. So nothing that has impacted long-term going forward from a customer perspective, okay?","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But also from the customers perspective, are you seeing any delays in programs, just being driven by them, not you, necessarily.","Rodney O'Neal","No, not really. Nothing material.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, we've seen a pretty big pullback on copper this year, year-to-date, certainly, a decent pullback last year. Just curious how that will ultimately funnel through your P&L? And if you would see the benefit or just because you're seen as indexing with your customers and the customers would actually receive the benefit. Just trying to understand the dynamics there.","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, it's Kevin, John. Most of that, as you know, most of the change in the copper prices, it's over 80% now. Our index are passed onto our customers on a slight lag basis. So from a, excuse me, in that P&L standpoint, there's very little impact. Where it does show up, for us, is on a, I think, revenue impact, given the fact that we pass that on to our customers in terms of higher price.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I've got 2 questions here. First, on Asia. If we look at Slide 12, we got Asia reported revenues up 27%. The adjusted, up only 8%. Can you create that bit in terms of currency? I'm guessing there's -- MVL falls in there a little bit as well.","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. There's a little bit of currency, but it's mostly the impact of MVL. That's the biggest effect.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, as you look at the performance in China, I think you said China was up from 11% or 12%?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you talk about what those new launches -- or is it more customer mix or content mix-related? Is there any additional color you can offer there, in terms of the sustainability of running revenues at that level?","Rodney O'Neal","Well, first of all, let's just go back and look at history. At that level of performance is basically what we've done over there, geez, the last decade. So it's nothing new there in terms of that number. And so it's just more of the same. A couple of things, the reason I would state to you that we feel pretty confident about it being sustainable, is the market -- is rotating into our space of more contented vehicles. And we see a shift, not only where the international OEs continue to offer very heavily content, but you're seeing the shift with the local Chinese brands also rotating in that direction. So it's just really more of what we've experienced over the last several years. So we feel pretty good about it.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Across the segments, is that impacting one of the segments more than the others? Or is it pretty evenly spread?","Rodney O'Neal","It's more directly in Electrical Architecture and our Powertrain. But as the market matures into our direction we're just now starting to see more content in other product offerings. We have about 21 of our 33 product lines there. I'm starting to see more electronics in those types of offerings that are coming into the vehicle, too. But primarily the driver is Powertrain and Electrical Architecture.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, there's a second question. If you look at the European restructuring, when we get to the end of this in 2014, I'm guessing, what portion of your European footprint is going to be manufacturing engineering overhead? Will it be Eastern Europe versus Western Europe?","Rodney O'Neal","I would say, we can get come back here and give you another number, but I'm going to say, off the top of my head, it's going to be in the low 80s.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, and today, you're...","Rodney O'Neal","Below 80%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The year-on-year improvement in the electrical margin is pretty impressive. Kevin, you listed a series of drivers behind that. Can you help quantify some of those, so we can get a sense of exactly what drove that margin higher?","Kevin P. Clark","Ravi, at the end of the day, I don't want to go through line item and the year-over-year variances by line item. Clearly, this -- you can imagine, has the benefit of the MVL, which was a big driver of the overall year-over-year improvement. The division has done a very good job managing manufacturing, as well as material productivity doing an extremely strong job on that, as well as managing their SG&A line. Now offsetting that, we have made incremental investments. And what we call advanced engineering, which is product development, as well as information systems that enhance the productivity of the business.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. Can you give us a little bit more color on why you underperformed the market in Europe in the quarter? What platform and vehicle makes were like? And also how big that labor disruption was?","Kevin P. Clark","The labor disruption, relative to market, was worth roughly, I don't know, $40 million, 2 points of growth, on a year-over-year basis. And it affected a couple of our segments. And as it relates to the European market, our guidance in Q4 for the first quarter was we expected the European market, at least the customers we serve, to be down roughly 15% on a year-over-year basis. Based on our visibility, that's in fact what we saw based on our customer mix, our customer mix and our platform mix. And on a year-over-year basis, there's a unit volume effect. And as we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters, there's also a product mix effect as it related to diesel fuel injection systems as well as higher end infotainment systems that makes the year-over-year revenue comp and margins look -- explain the year-over-year revenue comp and margin.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. And the labor disruption is now resolved?","Kevin P. Clark","Pardon me?","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The labor disruption is resolved?","Kevin P. Clark","The labor disruption? Yes, that is resolved.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And just finally, I don't know if you have detail on this, maybe early but did the Verizon plug-in module that you guys launched for the aftermarket, do you have a sense on how demand for that has picked up?","Kevin P. Clark","Well, we just launched it a few weeks ago. There's been demand. We're selling the product but we'll see how it plays out. It's still early.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up actually on that -- one of those last questions there. It seems, just on a very simple nominal level, you kind of maybe underperformed global production slightly or came actually very close to it. Your guidance has you outperforming it by 300 basis points, again ,just keeping things nominal and simple. There's been a few things you've mentioned here, the labor disruption sounds like mix ought to get better. But can you just tell us if we're forgetting anything? Why should you go from underperforming to outperforming in subsequent quarters?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, listen, I would -- just to be clear, I'd say, in the first quarter, we were below our Delphi Way to market or -- as global production, so we underperformed. Part of that is -- relates to regional and customer mix. Part of that relates to, quite frankly, the product mix that we've been talking about, as it relates to diesel and the infotainment business. We expect that underperformance relative to pull their weight to market in IHS to continue into Q2. I think that you'll see a reduction in that underperformance in Q2. And beginning in Q3 and Q4, you will see outperformance relative to the market. That is due to a couple of things, Patrick. One, product deterioration, product mix annualizes, one. And two, we're going to see product launches in the back half of the year that drive incremental revenue growth. But I would say for the full year, our current outlook, depending whether you picked up, you pick the low end or the high end of the range. The low end, we'd be roughly a point below overall margin, at the high end, we'd roughly a point above.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. That's a helpful way to frame it. Just as kind of a follow up on the new business piece. My guess is more longer dated, but on Slide 8, you have the new business bookings of $5.7 billion for the first quarter that annualizes to $22.8 billion. So it's a little bit below the run rate. Now is that -- is there some seasonality there that makes for sort of bigger bookings in subsequent quarters?","Rodney O'Neal","Yes. It's not smooth and linear like that. What we had in the Q1 was just a smaller to speak on terms of what we could. Our win rate is actually as good, or better, than it's been in the past. So it's just a matter of what was out there. We'll see that pick up relationship to the -- we expect to have a year equal to or better than to what we had last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So a question on the restructuring. It looks like you're still finding opportunities. Kevin, can you talk about how we should maybe think about the payback of the new restructuring? And perhaps, do you have an early read on we should think about look for restructuring savings in 2014?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. We -- let me answer the first part of your question. The paybacks on the newer program that had been implemented could be a short as 12 months, as long as 30 months. I would say, we would average 20 to 24 months when you mix those out. When you look at overall benefits associated with the restructuring program, we talked about run rate savings and\/or cumulative savings in 2014 of roughly $200 million. That's off of a base in 2013 of $80 million, so an incremental $120 million.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. And then just two housekeeping questions. One, can you share what you're assuming for Q2 European light vehicle production on a year-over-year basis. And did I hear that correctly that you're expecting an 18% tax rate in the second quarter?","Kevin P. Clark","Right. For European production, our outlook is European production will be down 6% in Q2 on a year-over-year basis, up slightly on a sequential basis. And then, I'm not sure I understood the second part of your question, but our guidance does assume an 18% tax rate in Q2.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, I just wanted to confirm that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of items. I want to come back to the comment about some potential program delays with global OEM platforms. We've heard about this from some other suppliers start shifting, instead of launching in '13 or '14, they might launch in '14 or 15. Are you saying that you haven't picked up evidence of that? And is there any change to your backlog over the next couple of years?","Rodney O'Neal","No, I haven't picked up on that. I haven't heard anything about customer shifting their global programs out 2 or 3 years. So we haven't seen it.","Kevin P. Clark","Nothing since we gave guidance on our Q4 call.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the other question, you guys compete head to head against some of the bigger Japanese suppliers, Denso and Yazaki and so forth? Has there been any change in their behavior? And a lot of the discussion about the yen has been about the OEMs and pricing and so forth. But I'm interested if you're seeing, even any subtle changes in a way that those players are behaving with respect to contracteds or anything like that? Or if you anticipate any changes on a go-forward basis?","Rodney O'Neal","I haven't seen anything and I don't anticipate anything.","Rodney O'Neal","In reality, Chris, to add a little bit more color, we've talked in the past and we say if it plays out ultimately in the revenue and awards. That we've actually benefited from the opportunity to see more opportunities that those suppliers have historically been able to lock up. So from a positive standpoint, we've seen an increase in opportunity.","Rodney O'Neal","But lastly, the way our model's put together, kind of products -- I mean, it's really hard to beat us on amortizing an FX on the yen's perspective. They're going to try to land something out of Japan into the regions that we operate in, where we're shipping, producing product engineering that locally hits, it's sure going to be hard to beat us from a cost perspective. So turning down the charge on the FX just doesn't work in the long run when you're competing against Delphi.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just the last point of clarification. You mentioned about the infotainment, some of the high-end infotainment hurting your mix in Europe, and you talked about this just last quarter. Just to be clear, is this a take rate issue where customers are not selecting that option as often on the vehicles that you supply? Or is it related to specific business that you have, and maybe there was a loss or a change in the contract that's specific to Delphi?","Kevin P. Clark","No, it's option take.","Rodney O'Neal","It's just option.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton with KeyBanc Capital Management.","Anthony Deem - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","This is Anthony Deem in for Brett Hoselton today. So there's 2 questions. First, I'd like to hit on the margins and the progress you plan to make throughout the rest of the year. You didn't make midpoint of your 2013 guidance. I'm looking at a 14.7% EBITDA margin in the back half, and first half at about 14.3%. And typical seasonality would be higher margins in the first half, sort of what you saw last year, and it looks like the absolute level of sales and tied within your guidance is actually slightly lower in the back half, albeit not much. So my question is simply, what are the big drivers to do better margin performance in the back half? Is it restructuring or synergies picking up?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, it's the benefit of the restructuring initiatives and the MVL synergies.","Anthony Deem - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. This is a reminder that $80 million for 2013 is that just mostly back half-loaded then, so assume $80 million for the back half?","Kevin P. Clark","It's mostly back half-loaded, it's not all back half. So I wouldn't plug $80 million in the...","Anthony Deem - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just secondly, on share buybacks. I understand they're not incorporated in your EPS forecast. But I was wondering if you could share some thoughts on the cadence of the share repurchases? $122 million first quarter here, have $525 million authorized for future repurchases. Do you have a specific target in mind for 2013, as to how much will be potentially spent, assuming that a significant acquisition might not occur?","Kevin P. Clark","I wouldn't say we have a specific target. We would like to remain opportunistic as it relates to share repurchases. So there are given points in time, or points in a quarter, where we want the flexibility to buy more or less. We said to the extent that we don't deploy for cash flow to pursue M&A opportunities, we will use that cash to repurchase stock. I think sitting in your seat, it's fair to assume that we continue to buy stock on an annualized basis at roughly the same level we've done over the last 12 months. And what we told people is in the range of $400 million to $500 million. But to the extent there aren't some interesting M&A opportunities, that amount will be more. What I caution you on is the timing as it relates to deploying that capital and at what price.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just a first one, quick point of follow up on the -- an earlier question on the new business bookings. So in the quarter, you booked $5.7 billion of new bookings. That seems to compare to $7.7 billion that you had reported in last year's slides, so that's like down 25%, 26%. What gives you strong confidence that this will pick up? I realize it's obviously a very lumpy, the timing of signing contract. But I guess, is there -- is it something that you see in your quoting activity that gives you confidence that you will pick materially?","Rodney O'Neal","I tried to address that in the earlier question, I apologize if I didn't do a very good job, so I'll try once again. Basically, what it was is just how much was sitting out on a global opportunity perspective. Our win rate was equal to or better than any win rate that we've ever had. So it was just the opportunity, and we expect our ultimate bookings for the year to equal or exceed what we had last year which was a record year. So it was just what was out there from an OEM perspective in terms of opportunity in the first quarter. That was it.","Emmanuel Rosner - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Understood, okay. And then just one question on your decremental margins in the quarter. If I just base myself from the slides of the revenue and EBITDA walk that you provide, it looks like the impact from the sales contraction was $77 million and the EBITDA level on $207 million on sales, that's about 37% decremental margin. That seems fairly high. Was there anything in particular that explains this? And can we expect such high level of incremental margins when the production actually turns on and becomes a tailwind?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. That decremental margin reflects the mix effect that we talked to you about previously. Primarily, as it relates to lost volume in our Powertrain business. Specifically, diesel systems in Europe, which are higher margins, as well as lower sales of those higher end infotainment systems, which tend to have higher margins as well.","Emmanuel Rosner - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So I guess in the back half, when you will expect some of that mix to turn around, you should benefit from that on the incremental margin as well?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. Let me be clear. When we look at our full year guidance in back half, we're not assuming that mix actually improves from the current run rate. What actually happens is we're starting to see a mix deterioration late the third quarter of last year. What you're seeing is the effect of it annualizing. So you got a simpler comp. If the market does improve and like volume does improve, and we see higher mix of diesel fuel injection systems, as well as higher take rates on some of the higher end infotainment systems that we just talked about, you would see an improvement in margins. However, we've not assumed the change in those take rates for the back half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A lot of my questions have been answered, but maybe just on the thermal segment. I know that you've committed to fixing this business and, obviously, you've earned a lot of credibility with regard to your ability to turn businesses around. But when do you think we might reasonably expect to start to see some margin stabilization? What are the actions that you're taking there to improve margin? And then lastly, do you think that scale might be an issue here at all? Could thermal benefit from maybe partnering with another market participant, whatever form that partnership might take?","Rodney O'Neal","Well, I think, if you look at the expansion sequentially on thermal, our first quarter actually did start moving north. And so we are not satisfied with where we are, but we are pleased that we do have, now, our upward trajectory that we always thought we would have. And that comes from a lot of hard work by the team, in terms of removing cost and restructuring itself and getting ahead of the volume takedown. And as the volume comes back, we feel that we're going to get some nice leverage from a margin perspective. So I think we're on track now. In terms of M&A activity with thermal, we don't comment on that. And the business is $1.5 billion. So it's got a lot to go.","Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great, I appreciate the color. And then I appreciate the color, too, on how your European business tracked, the reasons for it, relative to the industry. Maybe just a follow up on that. As we look out, say, 1 year or 2, as things have started to normalize there, hopefully, now how do you see organic revenues in Europe tracking, relative to the industry, longer term, in a more normalized environment?","Kevin P. Clark","In a more normalized environment, we're confident we outgrow the market in each of the regions that we operate in.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Most of mine have been answered but, any additional color on the restructuring in terms of how much of the actual actions have been completed? And maybe the cash impact going out, how much cash costs should we expect in the second half of the year when some of it get further deleted?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, it's Kevin Clark. A number of the initiatives have been put in place from a cash standpoint for full year 2013. We're estimating roughly $200 million of the $375 million will be spent. Most of that will be in the back half of the year, a little bit of it spent in this first quarter.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And in the electronics and safety segment, you've mentioned in the past that you've been rolling off lower margin businesses and did seem like the market underperformance is not that bad this quarter. Is most of that roll off business complete or is there still more to come this year?","Kevin P. Clark","There's a little bit more to come for the balance of the year, but we're reaching a point where it's close to being complete.","Rodney O'Neal","Operator, we will just close out, and then we'll close the call, okay?","Operator","Yes, sir, thank you.","Rodney O'Neal","Again, thank you for joining. I'm really pleased with the results that's the team created in Q1. Delphi continues to change the game with our products and are focused on strong financials and creating shareholder value.

My name is Crystal, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Delphi's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jessica Holscott, Delphi's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jessica, you may begin your conference.","Jessica L. Holscott","Thank you, Crystal, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. To follow along with today's presentation, our slides can be found at delphi.com under the Investors Section of the website. Please see Slide 2 for a disclosure on forward-looking statements, which we will be making on today\u2019s call and only reflects Delphi's current view of future financial performance, which may be materially different from our actual performance.","Joining us today will be Rodney O'Neal, Delphi's CEO and President; our Chief Operating Officer, Kevin Clark; as well as Mark Murphy, our CFO. As seen on Slide 3, Rod will begin with an overview of the quarter followed by Kevin, who will discuss the company strategy. And then, Mark will cover the financial results and the 2015 outlook in more detail.","With that, I'd like to turn over to Rod.","Rodney O'Neal","Thank you, Jessica. Good morning, everyone. Deeply appreciate you joining us today. Before we get into the presentation, I just want to spend a few moments on some words that I'd like to share with you. In my 43-year career, I've pretty much seen it all and never have I had more confidence in a management team than the Delphi's management team. I think our track record since the IPO, it speaks for itself. And I truly believe that this company is well-positioned for the future. And as you will see today, we have delivered another great year in 2014, and you should have tremendous confidence that 2015 and beyond will be even better. I want to thank you, all, personally for your support of me and of this company. It's been an honor and it's been an absolute privilege to have served you as Delphi's CEO.","Now let's turn our focus to the results, moving to Slide 5. We ended 2014 with a record fourth quarter. Revenue was up 3%, OI up 10%, margins expanded 120 basis points. And EPS, up 18%. And for the year, Delphi's revenues were $17 billion, up 4%. And our earnings per share increased 16%. So in summary, as I said, 2014 was a great year and we are confident of Delphi and our earnings outlook for 2015. And as we've told you in the past, we built an operating model to allow us to flex our cost structure, to deliver our margin, cash flow and earnings per share commitments.","We would also continue to maintain our focus on capital allocation. We returned over $1.3 billion to the shareholders in 2014. And our board recently approved a $1.5 billion share repurchase plan. So in summary, I am confident that we will continue to deliver in the strategic imperatives that drive shareholder value.","So Delphi has a lot to be excited about, and I'm extremely proud of our continued strong results. It's a testament to the focus that Delphi has on technologies that our customers want, that the markets are demanding.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin P. Clark","Well, thank you, Rod. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by thanking Rod for his dedication and commitment to Delphi. Rod has led the company through a successful transformation and has really positioned the company as an industry leader. Under his leadership, Delphi established a track record of strong execution for our customers and tremendous value creation for our shareholders.","We're confident we have the right strategy, the right management team and the right execution formula to build on our accomplishments and drive continued success. We've been very fortunate to have such a great leader and I'm honored to succeed Rod as Delphi's next CEO.","So as you can see on Slide 7, our priorities for this year remain unchanged. Our first is disciplined revenue growth, with a focus on continuing to diversify our mix of customers and regional revenues. Our second is to expand margins. The optimization of our operating footprint has resulted in the industry's absolute best cost structure, which translates into significant operating leverage and very strong margin expansion. Our third priority is to increase returns. We have a track record of deploying capital in a very disciplined manner. As Rod just mentioned, we returned over $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders in 2014 through both dividends and share repurchases. And our board recently authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program.","During the same period, we also closed 2 acquisitions. In summary, we remain intensely focused on the priorities that will continue to drive increased shareholder value.","Now turning to Slide 8. We booked $7.5 billion of new business in the fourth quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to over $25 billion. In January this year, we experienced very strong bookings, totaling almost $3 billion, reflecting a slippage of select bookings out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter of this year. Awards during the fourth quarter included a Toyota ECU award within the Powertrain segment, a Conquest Daimler wiring award as well as an Active Safety award, including a domain controller with a large European OEM, to name just a few. We also had a very balanced mix of regional bookings supporting our revenue diversification goals.","Slide 9 provides a snapshot of our fourth quarter results. As Rod mentioned, revenue was up approximately 3%, 2 points over market. Operating margin has expanded 120 basis points to a record 12.5%, representing 16% EBITDA margins. And earnings per share increased almost 18% to $1.32.","Slide 10 covers our full year results. Revenues increased roughly 4% over $17 billion. Operating margins expanded 70 basis points to 11.9%, bringing EBITDA margins to 15.3% for the full year. Earnings per share increased 16% to $5.09. And operating cash flow totaled over $2.1 billion.","Moving to Slide 11. As we discussed many times before, the leverage in our operating model efficiently converts earnings into cash flow that can be deployed to drive shareholder value. For example, we used the $2.1 billion in operating cash flow generated during 2014 as well as balance sheet cash to fund just over $850 million of CapEx, pay over $300 million in dividends, repurchase more than $1 billion of stock and fund 2 acquisitions with purchase prices totaling roughly $350 million. We remain committed to executing a very disciplined and balanced capital allocation plan that continues to drive shareholder value.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark to cover the numbers in more detail. Mark?","Mark J. Murphy","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will cover the fourth quarter and full year in greater detail then provide a review on 2015.","Consistent with prior calls, today's review of our actual and forecasted financials exclude restructuring and special items. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP is included at the back of this presentation and the press release.","Slide 13 mocks our fourth quarter revenue. Revenue was $4.2 billion with volume growth offset by price and currency effects. In Europe, strong Powertrain volume growth was more than offset by the timing of the roll-off and roll-on of programs in our Electrical Architecture business.","North America adjusted revenue increased roughly 7%, due principally to Electrical Architecture and Thermal growth. Growth in Asia remains strong at over 10%, driven by China and share gains across all the segments. South America revenue declined and continued economic weakness in the region. Despite some regional headwinds, Delphi's growth over market accelerated through the year to 2% above the market in the fourth quarter.","Slide 14 walks the year-over-year increase of 10% in operating income. Operating income margins expanded 120 basis points to a record 12.5% on strong performance and flow through on volume, partially offset by price.","Slide 15 covers our segments. As forecasted, Electrical Architecture's adjusted revenue increased 1.3% with strong growth in North America and Asia. Powertrain launches of new diesel and GDi programs drove nearly 6% above market growth. Electronics and Safety was down slightly, with strong asset safety growth more than offset by the previously discussed rationalization of reception systems and mechatronics. Thermal grew 6%, with above market growth in all regions.","All segments expanded margins in the quarter. Powertrain margins expanded 220 basis points on strong performance and volume leverage, E&S margins expanded 260 basis points on improved performance and Thermal margins increased 130 basis points.","Turning to Slide 16. Earnings per share increased 18% due to strong operating and earnings growth and, to a lesser extent, share repurchases. The tax rate for the quarter was approximately 15%.","Slide 17 walks our full year revenue. In 2014, adjusted revenue increased 4% on volume growth of 5%, partially offset by price reductions. Growth accelerated through the year to approximately 2% over market in the second half. Regionally, revenues in North America and Asia remains strong and grew at 7% and 11%, respectively. Europe revenues were flat, reflecting weak underlying vehicle production and program timing.","Slide 18 walks the year-over-year increase of over 9% in operating income. OI margins expanded 70 basis points to a record 11.9% on strong performance and flow through on volume growth.","Slide 19 shows our full year segment results. Electrical Architecture and Thermal segments delivered the strongest growth and exceeded market growth by 2% and 4%, respectively. Powertrain grew 2.5% and growth accelerated through the year to 5% over market in the second half on new product launches. Electronics and Safety revenue was up 1%, with strong growth in Active Safety and Asia, offset by previously mentioned product rationalization.","As with the quarter, operating margins expanded across all segments. E\/EA margins increased 50 basis points; Powertrain, 80; and E&S and Thermal, 90.","Turning to Slide 20. Earnings per share increased 16%, due primarily to strong operating margins growth -- operating earnings growth and share repurchases.","Slide 21 provides our full year guidance assumptions. We expect global vehicle production growth of 1% to 2%. By region, we assume 3% growth in North America; we expect vehicle production in Europe to be flat to 1%; in China, we expect 7%; and in South America, we're forecasting production to be flat.","Our guidance assumes a $1.20 euro rate. In light of euro volatility, and as a reminder, for every $0.01 change we estimate around $15 million annualized revenue impact, which would flow to OI at 10% to 12%. We expect lower commodity prices to offset euro headwinds at today's rate.","Our full year 2015 guidance is on Slide 22. On the right, we have our 2015 guidance at projected foreign exchange rates, including the euro of $1.20. We expect revenues of $17.1 billion to $17.5 billion, a 6% adjusted growth rate and 4% over market. We forecast growth to accelerate through the year on higher industry growth and new product launches.","We project growth to increase from 3% over market in the first quarter to almost 6% over market in the fourth quarter. We expect OI growth of 11% x currency and a 12.4% margin at midpoint, unchanged from previous guidance. We increased our EPS outlook to $5.35 to $5.65, to reflect lower share count, which is growth of 14% x currency to midpoint.","On Slide 23, we have first quarter '15 guidance. On the right, we have our guidance at projected currency rates, including euro at EUR at $1.20. We expect first quarter revenues of $4.15 billion to $4.25 billion. Adjusted growth of 4% or 3% over market. We expect operating income between $470 million to $500 million and 30-basis-point margin expansion at midpoint. We project EPS to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.30, a growth rate of 8% excluding currency.","So wrapping up, it was a record quarter and year for Delphi, and we expect to see continued acceleration of growth over market through calendar year '15.","Crystal, at this time, we would like to open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple questions. One is, could you maybe comment on what the pace of bookings would have been on a constant-currency basis? And any thoughts on what that might imply for the pace of growth for each of the divisions going forward?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. I think, Rod, on an absolute basis, I don't have it on a division-by-division. But year-over-year, you look at what we booked in 2014, there's roughly a $500 million headwind as it relates to currency in the year-over-year comparison.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of your margin targets, it looks like you had a big uptick in profitability in a few places. E&S actually did a 16.9% EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter and your target was 16% by 2016. Powertrain was 17.8% EBITDA, and I think also you had a target of 16% by 2016. I was wondering, if you can just give us some color on whether there's anything unusual on any of these divisions? And whether we should be thinking that the incrementals start to slow at some point here for these businesses?","Kevin P. Clark","So -- listen, it's Kevin, and Mark, you can certainly comment. There is nothing unusual with respect to the operating margins in any of the segments. I think it's a result of solid revenue growth and strong operating performance. Now I think as we look forward, we more than likely have to revisit our operating margin targets in some of those select divisions and evaluate whether we need to move them up.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, I was hoping you can give us some color on cash inflows and outflows, nonoperating ones for 2015. It looks like your -- the pace of buybacks accelerated. Should we be extrapolating from that? And any updated thoughts on the sale of Thermal in terms of range evaluations or timing?","Kevin P. Clark","With respect to capital allocation, listen, we'll continue to be opportunistic as it relates to share repurchases. There were some times during the fourth quarter where we did see weakness in stock price and we used that as an opportunity to repurchase incremental shares. As we said before, our priority, to the extent we can find value-accretive M&A opportunities, is to acquire strong businesses in the Electrical Architecture, Powertrain and E&S space. We have a fairly strong backlog and a lot of opportunities that we're currently evaluating that could affect somewhat the pace of share repurchases in 2015, but we'll see how that plays out. As it relates to your last question about Thermal, again, we're not going to comment on market rumors about any of our businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two questions. One around cadence and the other around kind of E\/EA midterm. Around the cadence, you talked about the 3% over organic first quarter and then accelerating through the year. Could you give us a sense of what -- how that plays out across the business units? And in particular, are there program launches or regulatory timelines we should keep focused on to get some -- see if that second half inflection is on track?","Mark J. Murphy","Yes, Brian, for the business, in total -- this is Mark. As mentioned, we're going to be about 3% over market in the first quarter. We expect to be about double that and relative to market in the fourth quarter. You'll see very strong growth through the year relative to market. In Powertrain, where it goes from roughly 5%, again, to roughly double that by the end of the year. And then, in -- at E&S, where it goes from roughly at market to high-single digits by the end of the year relative to market. E\/EA, which has a large program rolling off at the end of this year and the beginning -- or at the end of '14 and beginning of '15, it picks back up relative to market 2% to 3% over market through the rest of the year. Those are the big moves.","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. So if I can augment that. So you'll see stable growth in E\/EA roughly at market for the first couple of quarters accelerating a couple of points over market in the back half. On specific programs, you'll see a strong ramp up in E&S beginning in Q3 related to continued growth in Active Safety. Our outlook for the year is roughly 50% year-over-year growth in the Active Safety business, so we're seeing tremendous acceleration there as well as the roll-on of some infotainment programs with VW, Chrysler. On the Powertrain side, that growth is primarily going to be driven by the roll-on of some light-duty diesel programs with continued ramp-up of light-duty diesel programs with VW as well as some -- the launch of some GDi programs.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And in E\/EA, it looks like about 2% organic growth. To what extent that's driven by the roll-off you've talked about? And is that mechatronic? Or is that wiring businesses you might have liked to see? And then kind of secondly, how does that play out over time?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, E\/EA, -- the E\/EA business, as you know, historically over the last couple of years, it's been a very strong growth platform. Over the last couple of quarters and into the first 2 quarters of 2015, we're effectively seeing slower growth as a result of the roll-off of programs in Europe, principally price-related and margin-related. So improving, quite frankly, program mix. And you'll see the acceleration of growth, as Mark said, in the back half of the year. And longer term, as you see more vehicle electrification, we expect this to be a business that grows a solid 2, 3, 4 points over market. The mechatronics business that you're referring to is in our E&S segment, the Electronics and Safety segment. As Mark mentioned, that was a headwind during calendar year 2014 and will be a bit of a headwind during the calendar year 2015, but we're still projecting very strong growth in E&S, principally in the back half of this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a first question here on the Powertrain and E&S segments. It sounds like there's a real step function improvement in the margins and your expectation going forward. I mean, what changed there? I understand, yes, there is execution, but this is kind of a big step forward and it sounds like you're thinking about them differently going forward. I mean, what's changed?","Kevin P. Clark","Well, it's Kevin, and Rod you should chime in. On the E&S side, we talked about the transitioning of that business from a hardware business to a software business. As a result, volume flow through is very, very strong -- margin and volume flow through is very, very strong, and return on capital on that business is very strong. As it relates to Powertrain, it's really the benefit of 2 things. As you know, we've been focused on our cost structure and restructuring and repositioning our footprint in that business as well as getting the benefit of volume growth on that lower cost structure.","Rodney O'Neal","Yes. Nothing has really changed. It's just playing out exactly the way we said it would. I mean, if you think about the E&S rotation, the revenue has been flat past 4, 6 quarters. And -- but we told you we were going to be shaping the D&A of the business, moving to more software, moving away from -- being a high capital kind of utilization asset where it's more intellectual, more engineering. And I've said it before and I'll say it again, that the return on invested capital in that business would be breathtaking. And you're just seeing it play out. So nothing is new other than the traction of the plan that we've put in place and that the team is executing flawlessly.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So as we think about those margins going forward, though -- I mean, the standard ceilings that we might think about in the Automotive business -- I mean, are you guys going to be breaking through sort of those asymtotic limits? I mean, could this be something that has even more significant margin expansion and great -- and much, much greater returns than sort of the mid-20% that we've been thinking about?","Rodney O'Neal","I'll tell you one thing -- and I'll leave this with you and this team is focused on it, is that we are never satisfied with where we are. And we've been quite clear from the day that we set sail with the IPO on what our margin expansion would be. We are ahead of schedule or slightly ahead of schedule, to say the least. And I guess we'll talk more about maybe where the -- what I call, the height of these margins would be. I don't think we're there yet. But what I'm more excited about is the return on invested capital. I think that is the metric we're extremely focused on and not the margins as much. Obviously, if you get great explosion you get margin expansion as well as your EBITDA or OI expansion and ultimately, your return on invested capital explodes, but Kevin has been pretty good at making these predictions at the -- on investor show every year. So I'm going to look forward to, as a retiree, tune into that and see what he says in a couple of months.","Kevin P. Clark","No. Well, I think what Rod has done the great job with the team is having us focused on developing products that our customers really need and want. So having a great value proposition to our customer and at the same time, working day-to-day to execute and reduce our overall cost structure. So balancing the strategic with the tactical. And in that sort of scenario, I'm not sure that there is an absolute cap on what margins can or can't be.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's actually very exciting and interesting. Just a second question. I know you can't comment on asset sales or any specifics that have been reported in the press. But if we think about the proceeds that you could potentially get from any asset sale, whatever it might be, we -- how do we think about the funnel for those proceeds running through sort of your capital allocation strategy? Could they be more directly funneled into share buybacks? Or would they just run through the similar steps of the funnel?","Kevin P. Clark","Listen, I think the answer to that is it all depends. As we said, from a priority standpoint, ideally, we'd like to find value-accretive transactions. So that would be the primary focus area to the extent we can sell. As we said in the past, we'd return that incremental cash to shareholders, just as we've done historically.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the raw material benefits offsetting the ForEx headwinds. It's curious because we've heard this from a couple of other suppliers as well, but I -- we thought that a lot of the raw material fluctuations have been worked out with the automakers to be either stair-stepped in or indexed or pass-throughs. And just curious where you're seeing the real benefit from raw material cost. Is this on copper or just trying to understand there?","Mark J. Murphy","John, this is Mark Murphy. Most -- you're correct, most of our copper is -- it doesn't affect ROI and that's going with customers by contract. There is a portion, small portion, that we hedge. But as we work through the year, it will provide some cost benefit. In addition, we do expect oil, both through transportation cost and through resin cost to provide us some benefit. So right now, we see that benefit being about what the current euro rate headwinds are relative to our guidance.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly. Just one point of clarification. I think you mentioned that you said Active Safety would be up 50% year-over-year. Just want to make sure I heard that correctly and off of what base in 2014?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes -- no, Active Safety, our outlook for Active Safety would be growth of roughly 50%, and I think that's off of a baseline, we did roughly $160 million in revenues in 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I actually had wanted to follow-up just on that last question, not to kind of overdo it on $160 million in sales in Active Safety. But I am kind of curious if we could just talk a little bit about the products that you're seeing the highest take rate on -- in the shorter term. And if you want to add a little bit of color of how that changes over the next year or 2 as you -- as we look out on that $1.6 billion of backlog, that would be helpful as well.","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. Listen, for us, when we talk about Active Safety product areas, the primary area for us are things like visioning and radar algorithms, that's the primary product area, that's where we'll continue to see tremendous growth. In addition, we're seeing a fair amount of activity and have, in fact, booked some business, I mentioned in my prepared comments, with respect to multi-domain controllers, which is the real enabler to have increased levels of Active Safety in the automated driving. So those would be the 3 primary product areas driving growth.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Very interesting stuff. And just on the M&A piece. I know this is something you talk about periodically, but can you give us a sense of what the market is like? And just remind us of the asset priorities in terms of what you guys are thinking about?","Kevin P. Clark","Well, there's a lot of -- there is -- consistent with what we saw late last year, there's a fair amount of activity. It ranges from relatively small technology investments that are primarily in or around software, in or around our E&S and Powertrain divisions, to opportunities, that are more traditional M&A opportunities that augment or strengthen the existing product portfolio that we have in E\/EA and Powertrain and in E&S.","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one final one for me. Just on the slippage of the backlog, you mentioned that there were a couple of items that you originally anticipate falling into 2014, that got booked in that very large number in the first quarter. Is this something that is just maybe specific to you guys? Or is there kind of -- I know at various times, right, we've seen OEMs sort of push back on programs and delay certain things. So is this just kind of a just minor shift? Or is there -- is it symptomatic of delays or anything more important?","Rodney O'Neal","No. I would not read anything into it other than just the natural ebb and flows of things sometimes, particularly at the end of the year, it's just hard to get some of the things closed, closed off during the final throws of negotiations for specification, understandings, et cetera. And sometimes things move around. So I wouldn't read anything into it other than it was just one of those months and years where things went from one quarter to another quarter, and that's about it. Nothing special.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.","Samik Chatterjee - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Samik here on behalf of Ryan. So just -- first of all, I wanted to get your thoughts on the industry. I mean, looking at Slide 21 where you layout your industry growth assumptions for next year, I just wanted to get your thoughts on what are the -- like the upside and the downside risk you see in the industry? And we've been hearing from a few suppliers about the potential of Europe tracking better as registrations are up like 5% already in this year. So maybe just give us your thoughts on where do you see the biggest risk there.","Kevin P. Clark","Well, listen, it's early February. So I'd say that it's probably too early to call. We feel confident with respect to our macro and industry assumptions that we've laid out now. Listen, there's a possibility that you see a stronger Europe, but with what's going on in Eastern Europe right now, I would probably handicap that as low probability. South America continues to be very weak. We expect it to continue to be very weak. At some point, it needs to hit bottom and improve. But based on what we're looking at today, we don't see that happening. I guess if you were to look at potential upside and it's, I guess, corollary to what Mark was talking about in terms of the price of oil and the impact on raw material prices. It's potentially mix in North America, more SUVs, more trucks as a percent of total vehicle production, which we have higher vehicle content on. So that would drive incremental revenue growth if we saw that mix improvement.","Samik Chatterjee - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then on -- your 2014 operating margins came in at 11.9%. And when I go back and look at what you were guiding to at the same time last year, I think the range was 11.3% to 11.6%. So you clearly outperformed even the high end of that guidance. So maybe what really drove that upside? And when I look at 2015 guidance on margins, what is the sort of potential there to outperform that range as well?","Kevin P. Clark","We delivered on all of our performance initiatives, had strong, very solid execution and the benefit of that solid execution as well as some -- the benefit of some historical restructuring program. I think to the extent there's upside in the 2015 guidance. It would be driven by potentially volume, to the extent we see it, volume and mix as well as continued solid execution.","Samik Chatterjee - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And lastly, just more on the housekeeping side. Given that you have a very low cost footprint. Is there any in transaction currency exposure to keep in mind, given what's happened to currencies in the last quarter?","Mark J. Murphy","Yes. We generally -- we hedge our transactional exposures to the extent they're material, and that's -- right now, we're not accounting for any upside or downside relative to our guidance on that.","Kevin P. Clark","And there shouldn't be a big impact on that. There shouldn't be an impact one way or the other.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lim with Wells Fargo Securities.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So I don't mean to beat a dead horse here, but, obviously, E&S and Powertrain margins are really impressive. I was just wondering, can you provide additional color? Is that -- was that driven by some product mix? Some -- obviously, volume and restructuring? I was just wondering if you could box that a little more for us.","Kevin P. Clark","It's really across both those divisions. I'll give you big buckets. It really wasn't product mix as much as it was from material performance as well as very strong manufacturing performance. So those were the 2 big buckets for each.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then, when we look at Active Safety and infotainment, have you guys realized any kind of unexpected increase in take rates in the quarter?","Kevin P. Clark","Have we seen an increase in take rates during the quarter?","Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, like unexpected?","Kevin P. Clark","I'm not sure if it's unexpected, but we have seen -- again, we have seen acceleration in growth rate with respect to Active Safety revenues. So part of that would be driven by take rates.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then finally, on the $1.20 euro, it is trending lower. What was the thought process there of maintaining that guide versus maybe going to maybe a $1.15 or a $1.10?","Kevin P. Clark","There's been a lot of volatility with respect to FX rates. We've seen a lot of movement over a very short period of time. We gave guidance at $1.20 a couple of weeks ago when the euro was at $1.20. We thought it would be the least confusing and most clear to keep the assumption at that rate and make sure that we continue to communicate to people the impact of any sort of change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a follow-up on Powertrain. You said that growth is going to accelerate somewhat 5% to about 10% by the end of this year. Which of those 2 numbers is more reflective of what the medium to long-term growth rate would be like for the segment?","Kevin P. Clark","Powertrain is a business that when you look at content for vehicle growth, given demand for fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions, should be higher growth. As we said last year at Investor Day, our outlook for Powertrain is a business that grows -- should grow over the long term, 4, 5, 6 points over underlying vehicle production. Our view has not changed.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And just switching to something that we've discussed before. But if you look at your very strong margin traction and also your net business bookings, kind of, I'd say, topping of a plateauing at a certain level the last 2 or 3 years. Can you remind us again on any updated thoughts on growth versus margins and any potential trade-offs, maybe, you're thinking of for those 2 things?","Kevin P. Clark","Listen, as Rod mentioned, our primary focus is return on capital. So we're constantly evaluating the trade-off between revenue growth and margin and the capital we need to deploy to get that growth in margin dollar. So that is our primary -- the primary metric that we use, Ravi. In each unique situation, we evaluate it. Our primary objective is to drive increased return on capital.","Rodney O'Neal","And Ravi, I don't think you have to make those trade-offs, okay? I think, you can have them both and we've proven that, and we're going to continue to prove it.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it, that will be perfect. And if I can just follow-up on one thing you said in response to the last question. On euro, if that goes from $1.20 to $1.15, do you expect that to hit the bottom line? Or do you see offsets either from transaction or commodity that'll be incremental, and maybe cushion some of that blow?","Mark J. Murphy","Right now, Ravi, we see offsets to that through commodities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker with Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess 2 things I wanted walk through. First of all, on the Active Safety side. When does that become large enough that from a margin perspective, it starts to move the needle, either on -- either up or down?","Kevin P. Clark","Listen, I -- as we said, we -- today, we're investing in it. At $160 million in revenue it's actually a drag on our margins. Our guidance has been effectively -- once that business doubles, which it will do in a short period of time, we're effectively margin neutral. And then, I think, out beyond that is you reach a point where growth continues, it'll be a big contributor to overall margin within the E&S division. I think also important to say at E&S, beginning in Q3 of this year, we're going to see a significant ramp up in infotainment revenues. Over the last 3 years, we booked north of $2 billion in infotainment bookings and that is going to begin to roll-on, and that will be a significant contributor to revenue growth as well as margin expansion.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then as we look at what -- your bidding activity and what you're pursuing today, is there any characterization you can give in terms of the number of opportunities? The size of opportunities? When you look what maybe large in 2 or 3 years and now is it richer environment than what we've come out of.","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. The overall pool or funnel is bigger this year than what it was last year and our expectations heading into 2015 is that bookings would be roughly $27 billion. Now that can be affected by FX rates and timing, as Rod talked about earlier. But our outlook is more optimistic this year than what it was last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just on the bookings. Are you prepared to update us on the 3-year backlog? I'm not sure if you have those in front of just versus what you had a year ago?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. Listen, we'll do that at Investor Day.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on margins, if I look at the -- just the gross incremental margin in 2014, I think it once again is about 33%. In 2015, you have a lot of new business, does that mean that we should expect a bit of a lower incremental? Or do you think you can kind of maintain that 30-plus-percent gross incremental in 2015?","Mark J. Murphy","Yes, Itay, I think you can assume similar rates to what we've been seeing, between 20% and 30%.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","20% to 30%, great. And then, I noticed, too, that the net performance Other of $61 million in the quarter was a nice acceleration for you. I think probably the highest quarter of the year. Any seasonality there? Or is this sort of a good number for us to work with in 2015 as you deliver additional efficiencies?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, I think you got to keep in mind -- in the fourth quarter, we tend to have more engineering rebuilds. So from a calendarization standpoint, as you look at it, fourth quarter, relative to other quarters during a given year, we tend to have a higher mix of engineering rebuilds. But on a year -- other than that, on a year-over-year basis, as we said, it's volume and solid operating performance.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then, just lastly, on the commodity cost. I think you mentioned before, oil is giving you a bit of a tailwind. Any way to do a sensitivity roughly for 5% or 10%? I think in my numbers, we may have, maybe, $20 million for every 10%. I'm not sure if that's sort of a ballpark to think about the earnings impact from the change in oil as we model some of the FX headwinds out there?","Mark J. Murphy","For oil, we're looking at roughly $3 to $5 or so per $10 of barrel of oil change. So ballpark, that's about it.","Kevin P. Clark","So about $5 million of earnings on each $10, up or down.","Mark J. Murphy","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Galves with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Daniel Galves - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was interested in your comment that you won a Toyota Powertrain contract in January. Could you just remind us of your historical relationship with Toyota? Any color on kind of what region this was in? And does this represent any kind of a breakthrough with this customer?","Kevin P. Clark","Well, the Toyota -- and I'll let Rod comment on the history. Toyota was actually in the fourth quarter, not -- to make sure I clarify things. Those were fourth quarter awards that we...","Rodney O'Neal","Yes. I -- Our relationship with Toyota, which actually is our largest Japanese OE, is primarily focused here in North America. It's been a great relationship. However, I've been pretty clear in the past. I mean, when you look at our penetration with the Japanese OEs, somewhere probably in the $500 million, $700 million range of our total revenue per year. So it's quite small when you consider the amount of cars that they build. But, obviously, they've got a fleet of suppliers that do very similar things to us and they got ownership in those suppliers, and we have had a lot of opportunity. That being said, there's been more technical discussions over the past 1, 1.5 years. I wouldn't exactly call it super traction, but I will call it encouraging. And there's nothing in our forecast that would predict a radical change where we would begin to book more. But I would say that the environment is better for us than it's ever been and we'll see how it plays itself out.","Daniel Galves - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And just on the cash return side, you returned well over 100% of free cash flow in 2014. Can you just remind us of where you are versus your leverage targets? And whether there's potential to continue to return more than 100%?","Mark J. Murphy","Yes. We're under 1 on a debt-to-EBITDA, we're at about 0.6 net debt-to-EBITDA. And we do have additional capacity. As you know, we just recently were upgraded to BBB last quarter, so we have capacity for additional leverage.","Daniel Galves - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. So 1x is your target or your -- where you feel comfortable?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. I think what we said in the past is kind of 1.5x debt-to-EBITDA. There will be points and time where it gets below and moves up, and we balance the opportunity set for M&A with share repurchases.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just maybe one bigger picture question. I mean, you talked a little bit about the move from hardware to software, and it seems like a lot of suppliers are increasingly talking about that and almost building up an army of engineers as software becomes more important and making it a competitive selling point. So I guess I just wanted to get your view broadly on how the industry is evolving there, particularly as it pertains to the segments that you participate in. And also how you think you are positioned on that engineering front and whether you need to make incremental investment there?","Kevin P. Clark","Rodney?","Rodney O'Neal","Yes. I mean, the industry continuously evolves in terms of sophistication of the automobile, particularly in the space that we staked out, which is safety interconnect [ph]. And so, I guess, in my mind and the way we've outlined to you guys our journey and our story and our value prop, there's nothing new here. And so the -- in all 3 spaces, the whole focus is to get the vehicle cleaner in terms of environmental impact, get the vehicle safer. And then, in doing that, that's the visioning and sensing systems that we've always said. As you remember, Delphi at one point in time was in ride down safety products like airbags and belts, et cetera, and we exited those, and we stayed focused on visioning and sensing systems because we thought that was the future. And so from an investment perspective, we've been pretty clear that our investment, both technically, from an engineering base, is somewhere in the -- I don't know, 7% to 8% range per year, and capital is in the 3.5% to 4.5% range. And so your question about, do we see us having to invest more? No, it's been a steady cadence and that's what we're going to continue to do. And so it's actually -- I'm quite proud that it's played out exactly the way we called it and we're perfectly positioned to capture this next wave of technology advancement in the vehicle in the safety inter-connectivity. It's great and we're perfectly positioned for.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, one, maybe, just quickly. You talked more housekeeping. You talked a little bit about some of the cross rates. Should we not expect a benefit from your Mexican manufacturing footprint?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, Joe, there may be a small benefit on that through the year. Part -- a good part of that is hedged. So as those hedges are reset and we work through the year, that could be additional benefit.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your last question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I wanted to ask you just trying to put a final point on Europe growth. So this quarter, we saw again Europe decline a little bit more than the production, part of it you mentioned was roll-off of some E\/EA business. In which quarter or and at what point in time can you expect Delphi revenues to grow in line to faster than the industry, specifically in Europe?","Mark J. Murphy","Well, on E\/EA, we grew faster than the market in fourth, though we did not grow faster in the market in Europe with E\/EA. We have some new programs rolling on in the wire harness business and expect it to pick up and grow faster than market in the back half of the year in E\/EA in Europe.","Kevin P. Clark","And I think -- if I can chime in, I think with respect to total Delphi when you look at it during calendar year 2015, growth versus market, we'll effectively be in line with market from Q1, and you'll see an acceleration of growth versus market through Q2, Q3, and Q4.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And that includes in Europe as well?","Kevin P. Clark","That is Europe, specifically. I'm referencing your question about Europe.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then, just one point about China. I think that, obviously, a very strong part of your story -- your presence there. Can you just give us an update or size up your revenue there in 2014 in the sort of growth rate that you expect this year in China, specifically?","Kevin P. Clark","Well, our China business is well over $3 billion. And from an overall growth rate, as we look at 2015, overall growth rate is going to continue to be in the double-digit range.","Emmanuel Rosner - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then one final point, if I may. Back to the Thermal business. I completely appreciate and understand no comments on asset sales. Just what is your official stance on your Thermal business right now? Is it officially evaluating alternatives, strategically? Or is it core -- like how do you think about the business?","Kevin P. Clark","No, it's -- as we've said in the past, it's an important business. It's a business that we've seen very solid revenue growth during calendar year 2014. We'll continue to see it in 2015. We've seen margin expansion on a year-over-year basis. And we're focused on continuing to improve it. We'll achieve 10% EBITDA margins in 2016 and you'll continue to see expansion in margins during 2015. So that's our official stance, which is no different than what we said previously.","Jessica L. Holscott","Great, thank you for participating in today's call.

My name is Kayla and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to Delphi Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Elena Rosman, Delphi's Vice President of Investor Relations. Elena, you may begin.","Elena Dom Rosman - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thank you, Kayla, and good morning. Thank you for joining Delphi's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. To follow along with today's presentation our slides can be found at delphi.com under the Investor section of the website. And consistent with prior calls, today's review of our actual and forecasted financials exclude restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations of Delphi.","The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included at the back of the presentation and the press release.","Now we ask you to look at slide two for disclosure on our forward-looking statements, which reflect Delphi's current view of future financial performance, which may materially differ from our actual performance.","Joining us today will be Kevin Clark, Delphi's President and CEO; and Joe Massaro, CFO and Senior Vice President.","As seen on slide three, Kevin will cover company highlights for the quarter and then Joe will get into the financial results and the outlook for the remainder of the year in more detail.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Clark.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before Joe gets into our financial results, let me provide some context on the third quarter.","Beginning with the highlights on slide five, we had a solid quarter, delivering strong revenue and earnings growth. Revenue increased 10% driven by double-digit growth in both our Electronics & Safety and Electrical Architectural segments, and mid-single digit growth in our Powertrain business.","Operating income increased to $531 million and operating margins expanded to 13%, driven by flow-through on volume growth and continued cost structure optimization, partially offset by some strategic investments.","Earnings per share increased 17% to $1.50 and we generated strong cash flow, a portion of which we use to return $175 million of cash to shareholders bringing the year-to-date total for share repurchases and dividends to roughly $770 million.","As Joe will cover later, we also took actions during the quarter to strengthen our capital structure and divest our Mechatronics business, continuing the rotation of our product portfolio into high-growth sectors.","Lastly, we delivered another strong bookings quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $18 billion. The leadership team remains focused on executing flawlessly and delivering on our commitments.","Turning to slide six, the automotive industry's transformation has been the theme at each of this year's major auto shows with the highway seeing the megatrends of Safe, Green and Connected, which are at the heart of our strategy. The theme of the recent commercial vehicle show in Hannover was around new mobility. I met with a number of customers who are looking to Delphi to help solve some of their toughest challenges resulting from these megatrends.","In addition to the usual discussions regarding new Powertrain technologies and their impact on increased fuel efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions, much of the dialogue was around vehicle connectivity, active safety, automated driving as a means of increasing driver productivity, enhancing vehicle safety and improving fuel economy, each of which translates into real cost savings for fleet managers.","And turning to slide seven, at the Paris Auto Show, vehicle electrification was front and center, as customers look to close regulatory gaps on CO2 emissions and improve fuel economy. Industry experts and even some of our customers are now forecasting 25% to 30% of vehicles to be electrified by 2025. And given our strength in powertrain technology, electrical architecture and power electronics, Delphi has unique competitive solutions in the intelligent electrification of passenger vehicles that cost effectively help our customers meet increasingly stringent regulatory standards.","These solutions are shown in greater detail on slide eight. We're well positioned regardless of the trend in vehicle electrification and our content per vehicle grows with increased electrification, from two to four times the content of a gas internal combustion engine on a 48-volt vehicle, depending on whether we're doing components or a full system integration, all the way up to seven to eight times the content on a full electric car. So the trend towards increased electrification is very good for Delphi.","Slide nine highlights our $18 million bookings year-to-date which includes large complex (5:45) wins for Electrical Architecture in Asia and additional content wins in North America. Awards for gas fuel injection systems with OEMs in both North America and Europe and major infotainment wins including a program for a large European OEM and an active safety win with ChangAn (06:03) in China.","On the right side of the chart are the cumulative bookings for some of our faster growing technologies underpinning the Safe, Green and Connected megatrends.","Let's turn to slide 10 for another example. The road to increased vehicle connectivity and automation requires faster speeds for data processing and more high-speed computing power. High-speed vehicle computers such as the Multi-Domain Controller we launched with Audi in 2017 and the integrated passive controller we launched with Volvo in 2018 makes decisions 34,000 times faster than humans.","Through the fusion of sensors and the integration of advanced software algorithms, these technologies reduce architectural complexity while increasing computer processing power and enabling vehicle connectivity.","This serves as a nice bridge to slide 11, which provides an overview of our recently announced partnership with Mobileye. We've experienced significant interest from customers in the U.S., Europe, Korea, China and Japan, for a central sensing localization and planning automated driving platform.","When you combine Mobileye's vision and road experience management systems with Delphi's sensor suite, automated driving software from Ottomatika, and our Multi-Domain Controller, no other entity comes close to matching the quality or the capability of this automated driving system.","Our collaboration is off to a fast start and is making significant headway. In fact, you're going to be able to see and ride in the first demonstration vehicle along with several other important technologies at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.","Finally, on slide 12, I'm proud to say Delphi has received two nominations for the Automotive News PACE Awards, one of the industry recognition forms for innovation. Delphi is being recognized for its gesture recognition technology, which recently launched on the all-new BMW 7-Series. And for our 360 degree short range radar for ADAS systems, that provides superior radar performance while enabling many new sensing capabilities that recently launched on a new Hyundai vehicle with several other OEs launching next year.","This is really a great testament to the capabilities and dedication of our teams, which have received over 60 nominations and won 18 PACE awards over the past two decades.","So with that, I'm going to hand the call over to Joe.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will review our third quarter financial performance before discussing our guidance for the remainder of the year.","Beginning on slide 14 with a summary of our third quarter financial performance, we are very pleased with the third quarter results as Kevin mentioned. Adjusted revenue grew double digits, up 10%. Our EBITDA margins expanded 60 basis points to 17.2% and operating margins expanded 10 basis points to 13%.","Earnings per share grew 17% driven by solid sales growth. And in the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $415 million and purchased 1.5 million shares, totaling approximately $100 million.","With our 7874 issue behind us, our low tax rate, 17% for the quarter, continues to allow us to deploy capital more effectively.","Slide 15 provides greater detail on revenue in the quarter. Sales growth outpaced expectations with strong performance around the world, particularly in Europe and China. Beginning with the walk on the left, sales volume more than offset price, foreign exchange and commodity headwinds. FX headwinds were largely driven by the weakening British pound and Chinese RMB, as we had previously guided. And the HellermannTyton acquisition contributed approximately $200 million of revenue, up 10% year-over-year, partially offset by the Reception Systems divestiture.","Moving to the right, with the exception of South America, all regions benefited from strong growth. Again, in particular, China was up 27% for the quarter benefiting in part from a weak Q3 2015, while Europe benefited from strong growth in Electrical Architecture and E&S, driven by robust new program launches.","Turning to operating income, slide 16 walks the year-over-year change for third quarter. Overall, operating margins were in line at 13%. Strong sales growth combined with accretive M&A and net performance, contributed a margin expansion in the quarter, partially offset by price and FX headwinds.","Net performance was favorable, despite higher levels of engineering spend, primarily related to our automated driving initiatives in E&S and the operational inefficiency of Electrical Architecture we highlighted last quarter.","On slide 17, you can see a breakdown of performance by segment. Electrical Architecture had adjusted growth of 11% with new launches benefiting Europe and higher volumes in China.","Margins expanded 30 basis points year-over-year on higher volumes. As previously discussed, we continue to experience operational inefficiencies in the business, which negatively impacted our performance in the quarter by approximately $15 million, in line with our previous expectations.","Powertrain also delivered above market adjusted growth of 4% with strong double-digit gains in gas direct injection and variable valve train, more than offsetting mid- to high-single-digit declines in commercial and light duty diesel volumes.","Powertrain margins expanded 30 basis points on strong manufacturing performance, partially offset by the FX impact of the weakening GBP and Chinese RMB, primarily related to the FX transaction impact in our Powertrain UK and China operations.","Electronics & Safety adjusted growth accelerated to a record 17% in the quarter. New program launches, particularly in active safety and infotainment, continue to drive double-digit growth. As Kevin mentioned, we are investing alongside this growth to position the company for the acceleration in automated driving opportunities, with higher engineering investments in the quarter negatively impacting E&S margins by approximately 40 basis points.","It is important to note that the segment numbers for both 2015 and 2016 reflect the realignment of our power electronics business from E&S to Powertrain. This move better aligns our propulsion technologies with the changing needs of our customers. The impact is relatively small, but the breakeven sales were approximately $30 million in the quarter.","Turning to slide 18, EPS grew 17% versus the prior year, representing our third quarter of double-digit EPS growth this year. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.09, driven primarily by the flow-through of higher than expected sales, and below the line items contributed approximately $0.03, including the results from our non-consolidated joint ventures.","Turning to slide 19, the third quarter also proved to be active on the capital structure front. We completed the refinancing of our 2023 senior notes that resulted in a less expensive, longer tenored capital structure.","As you can see, by using new, long-term debt denominated in both U.S. dollars and euros, including $300 million of 30-year senior notes at 4.4%, we were able to extend the time to maturity by almost three years and optimize the cost of funds, decreasing our interest expense by approximately $20 million annually. And we are generating more free cash flow, driven by higher operating earnings and lower cash taxes, providing more cash for key investments and capital redeployment.","Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. As Kevin mentioned, we signed a definitive agreement to divest our Mechatronics business. With annual sales of approximately $250 million, we expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter.","We continue to be very active in the market for acquisitions and investments, focused on companies with leading technologies, strong management teams and operating capabilities that give us the confidence in our ability to integrate and drive synergies.","We are committed to paying a competitive dividend and returning excess capital to shareholders. As you can see from our recent track record, since 2014, we've returned over $3.5 billion in the form of share repurchases and dividends. And for the full year, we are on pace to complete $600 million of buybacks, consistent with our prior outlook.","Turning to slide 20 and starting with the outlook for the fourth quarter on the left, revenue is expected to be $4.1 billion at the midpoint, reflecting approximately 4% adjusted growth on flat vehicle production, lapping a tough comparable from Q4 2015. Margins, however, are expected to expand 60 basis points year-over-year, with strong net performance helped in part by the lapping of the inefficiencies we experienced last year in China. Earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.65, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint.","Moving to the right of the slide, you can see our updated full year outlook. We are reflecting the strength of the third quarter performance in our updated full year guidance for sales and earnings. We now expect sales of approximately $16.45 billion at the midpoint, up approximately 7%, and EPS in the range of $6 to $6.10 per share, up 16% over last year.","Now before I hand it back to Kevin for some closing remarks, given the time of year, we begin to get questions on next year and I thought it would be helpful to spend a minute on our initial considerations for 2017.","As we sit here today, we believe global vehicle production for next year will be flat to 2016 levels. However, with our strong portfolio of relevant technologies, we would expect Delphi to grow mid-single digit organic, driven by our faster growing product lines, active safety, infotainment, GDi and vehicle electrification, all of which are expected to grow strong double digits again in 2017.","As always, our team remains focused on optimizing our cost structure and driving increased efficiencies throughout the organization. This relentless focus will allow us to continue to expand operating margins and invest in key technologies, including our CSLP automated driving partnership with Mobileye.","Although we experienced significant FX and commodity headwinds in 2016, if spot rates held where they are today, we would only expect a $150 million headwind to revenue in 2017.","Lastly, as we noted, the divestiture of Mechatronics is expected to close late in the fourth quarter and will be accretive to our 2017 adjusted growth rate, although the sale will be a headwind to reported revenue and operating income.","So as we reflect on the future, we have a more competitive technology portfolio, a more flexible business model and a less expensive capital structure that will drive revenue, earnings and cash flow growth through the cycle.","And with that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some closing remarks before we open it up to questions.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks, Joe. Thanks a lot. Now wrapping up our formal comments on slide 21. As we said, we delivered a strong performance in the third quarter with double-digit sales and earnings growth. We remain confident in our 2016 outlook, which includes 7% organic growth, mid-teens EPS growth and $1.1 billion of free cash flow.","And as Joe just mentioned, we continue to aggressively optimize our cost structure to increase our flexibility, continue to expand margins and fund smart investments in technology that will enhance our competitive position and drive further profitable growth. And we remain focused on executing over the balance of this year and throughout 2017.","We're confident that our industry-leading cost structure, operating discipline and Safe, Green and Connected technology portfolio will continue to yield margin expansion and earnings growth. And our ability to convert more income to cash and effectively deploy capital provides additional leverage to drive shareholder value in the years to come.","So with that, we'll now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Wanted to ask a couple things, first, on the portfolio repositioning, could you talk about what the proceeds are and what the EBITDA was on that Mechatronics business and are you thinking about any other changes to the portfolio, and I'm thinking specifically vis-\u00e0-vis Powertrain? And just given what we're seeing with diesel declines and growth in electrification, how are you thinking about the positioning of that division?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Okay. Why don't I, Rod, if I could start with a little bit of background as it relates to the divestitures. Those of you on the phone, most of you know we've been talking about our Mechatronics business as non-core and slow growth, and quite frankly a headwind to growth over the last couple years. And as we work to reposition the portfolio and reposition E&S specifically as less mechanical, a little less electrical and much more software orientation, this was a logical step in continuing to rotate that overall portfolio. And you know, in terms of what we do with the business, we've been actually working on that for, let's call it the last year or so.","I'll let Joe touch on the numbers.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, Rod, we won't be disclosing proceeds and deal specifics until the transaction closes. We expect it to close in December of this coming year. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, think of revenue as approximately $250 million. I would think of EBIT around the $70 million number. And remember, we had a similar situation with reception systems. Those businesses are more profitable relative to the portfolio because we no longer \u2013 the last couple of years we haven't been investing in engineering and pursuit.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Any thoughts on the Powertrain and some of the trends that you're observing there on diesel?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. Why don't I start and again, Joe, you can make any comments. Listen, Powertrain is an important part of our overall portfolio. Clearly there is a headwind as it relates to light duty diesel penetration in the market. Now offsetting that is significant growth in gas direct injection and variable valve train technology. So to put it in perspective, GDi for us this year will grow close to 50%, variable valve train close to 40%. So we're working very hard to close the gap in terms of revenue headwind on light duty diesel with replacement technologies on the gas side of the engine.","And in addition to that, the rationale for our movement of the power electronics out of E&S into Powertrain is, given the trend in light duty diesel, we're seeing more of that customer interaction, quite frankly, take place within the Powertrain functions of our customers than where it's been historically as they work to improve fuel economy and reduce fuel emissions. So that was the rationale for why we've moved that product line there. And that's another product line where we're seeing I think close to 100% growth this year in revenue, albeit off of a very small number today.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Rod, it's Joe. Just one last thing I meant to finish a Mechatronics I would also note that as we look forward, that business is Western European based so in addition to the sales proceeds, we were facing a fairly significant shutdown cost, call it late 2018 and 2019 as we deemphasize growth in that business, so we'll also be out from under that as well as we move forward with the sale.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. It...","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","And then we'll start \u2013 so go ahead, Rod. Sorry.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, it's not surprising. I think you guys have talked about this. One other thing I wanted to ask and I'll let other people ask questions, but could you just talk about broadly the outlook for R&D spending as we think about 2017 and beyond? I know you were targeting 18%, 19% EBITDAs and mid-14% EBITs towards the end of the decade, like 15 basis points of expansion per year. Some of your peers are pointing to increasing pressures from R&D and you guys have highlighted quite a bit of spending on active safety and autonomous driving. So can you size up what kind of headwind you're looking at and how we should be putting that into context for margins?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, I think Rod, the way, and I mentioned the 2017, some of the additional planning considerations, it's still early days from a planning perspective and we're going to investments now. Clearly we'll spend more on automated driving. We'll increase that. As we're setting up our targets internally, we're focused on call it 30 to 40 basis points of margin expansion next year and that would be inclusive of any investment in automated driving.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Morning, John.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Maybe if I could just kind of follow up on that margin direction you were just going in. Quite simplistically, if you can, what kind of sales growth do you need to maintain margins and what kind of sales growth do you need to expand margins? And I'm trying to think about all else equal here because I mean there could be some big swings in global volume, and I'm just trying to understand. We tend to oversimplify and think about incremental and decrementals. But just curious what you're thinking about, what kind of sales growth you need to maintain margins?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, listen, John, let me take a first shot at it. Our business model really remains unchanged right? We build a plan and work to execute where we have performance initiatives that offset price and economics. And I think what we've talked about in the past is the 10% reduction in vehicle production would translate into about 150 basis points of margin degradation. And on the upside, flow-through of each dollar of volume flow through $0.18 to $0.20 of operating income.","That model really, really doesn't change and I think we've exhibited times in the past where whether it was in a specific region or it's in a particular quarter where we have the ability to flex our cost structure, it's one of the benefits of 90% of our hourly workers being in low-cost countries, 75% of manufacturing facilities in low-cost countries and a high level of temp labor where we have the ability to flex. And so at the end of the day, I'm not sure I have a specific number. Joe, I'll defer to you.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, at this point in the planning process, John, I'd revert back to what I just mentioned. In a flat market with appropriate levels of investment to support automated driving, we are targeting a 30 to 40 basis points expansion and I would just calibrate off of that.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's incredibly helpful. And then a second question, if we look at slide nine, just on the backlog bookings here, or the bookings, do you think you are going to have a large fourth quarter where we could see this ramp up to an equal level of what we saw in 2015? And also, as we think about these new business bookings, what is the margin and return profile on these new bookings? Is that higher than corp average during the course of the lifecycle of those contracts?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, so with respect to the threshold for profitability, again, nothing's changed there. They're at or above our current profit margin. So over the life of the program you'd see improved profitability. With respect to bookings, we're $18 billion year-to-date; last year we did $26 billion. We booked another $2 billion in the month of October. I think we have a steady line of sight to $26 billion for the full year. Given timing from a customer standpoint, it's possible that we fall $1 billion short, that we're in the $25 billion to $26 billion range, John.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","But that was in Q1. Yeah.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, that would be quarter-to-quarter, John. So we have a clear line of sight directionally towards that number.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. And then just one housekeeping. On slide eight it looks like you see some pretty good expansion as we move to the full electrification in vehicle. The baseline there, I would imagine is about $400 to $500 of potential content on an ICE engine. Is that correct, what that ex would be, roughly?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. On a gas ICE engine, John, it's closer to $300, diesel would be $500, but we're using gas as the starting point here.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. Okay. Cool. Thank you very much.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, good morning. Have a question around diesel mix, just following up on that and then I'll ask one on active safety. You talked, just $500 diesel, $250 gas per engine content. As you look at your customer base and think about a consumer going into a showroom in Europe and maybe having some prejudice against diesel, given your customers' offerings in the show room, do they have the GDi engines out on the market now that the consumer could leave with a GDi? Or do you still have a base of customers with, you're doing the diesel but the gas engines are naturally aspirated so there's more of a risk there?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, no. Listen, our customer base currently has GDi engines out in the market that can serve as a replacement for light duty diesel engines on pass cars, to the extent that that's what a consumer is looking for. That answer your question?","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. And so when you talk about building more GDi, is that with different OEMs or just across a greater rate of the lineup of those OEMs?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","It's penetration of existing as well as growth with new OEMs; It's both. It's really both.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Second question is more around active safety. And since we last chatted on calls, NHTSA has come out with some \"guidelines\", for testing active safety systems and voluntary compliance. We've seen actually a startup, according to TechCrunch withdraw it's ADAS aftermarket product due to NHTSA concerns.","Can you just maybe comment on how you see that evolving? And then to what extent is that you're having these discussions and in your partnership with Mobileye, sort of the idea of regulatory compliance we can walk you through almost FAA, FDA style, that compliance process? And to what it extent is that a competitive advantage in E&S?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, listen, I think we at Delphi whether it's within E&S or our other businesses, have for a long time, worked with customers and regulatory authorities as it specifically relates to shaping regulation. Regulation within automated driving and active safety is good, right? It forces standardization. And once you have standardization, suppliers and automotive OEs can work on technology as well as commercializing the cost and coming down the curve, which allows faster and more rapid adoption. So that's something that is very positive.","As we talk about our partnership with Mobileye, one of the big compelling reasons there to do that was, how do we develop quickly a standardized system that can be leveraged across OEs, or across vehicle platforms, can be done quickly and can be done at a very competitive cost? Because as you know our OEs are very, very focused on cost as it relates to technology.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, everybody.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Hi, Adam.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Good morning, everybody. Just two questions, the first is on active safety. And as these systems \u2013 you can't watch any sporting event or, frankly, any, let's say, 10-minute stretch of television without seeing another advertisement of a car stopping before hurting somebody or killing somebody. But just seems to me that you're in a great position to start getting some of the real-world data at a kind of geometric rate to analyze how much safer these technologies are given a level of cost in your systems that you're providing your OEM customers.","So I guess the high-level question is, putting the fully autonomous cars that could be theoretically thousands of times safer than human driving aside just for a moment, how much per unit roughly do you think the content is per unit to kind of have a dramatic like a 30% or 40%, or 40% or 50% reduction of vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-pedestrian type collisions based on the data and the technology and you, as a member of the scientific community you're observing? Is it hundreds of dollars? Is it a thousand or is it thousands of dollars? I gave you those buckets (33:41).","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. So, Adam, it's a very accurate observation and it's a great question. Listen, we've been really clear. We look at automated driving as on the spectrum of active safety. And the reality is if you get to level 3 automated driving, you get 80% of the safety benefit at 20% of the cost, right? So, and we estimate total on-boarding for automated driving at \u2013 Joe, help me.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","For automated driving it's...","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Couple thousand dollars.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Couple thousand dollars.","Elena Dom Rosman - Delphi Automotive Plc","At full volume, right?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, couple thousand dollars. So, listen, a lot of benefit can be really derived there. As you look at going from level 3 to level 4 or level 5, level 5 especially, we see the initial demand being primarily driven by the mobility providers, the folks that you are familiar with, who have another economic incentive to have a driver out of a car and for it to be fully autonomous. Now, there are additional OEs who are working on fully automated vehicles as well for a number of other reasons. But I think that's a great question and our view is yeah, at level 3 you get 80% of the benefit at 20% of the cost.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, that's very helpful and I think that that answer is consistent with your Tier 1 competitors. But I must say, and I've been asking every OEM this same question. And we don't get the same specific answer. We get a either no answer or maybe thousands of dollars. And I'm just curious, is that because maybe if you can really get 80% of the benefit for maybe only $5 or $10 a month of monthly payment on a 72-month car loan, boy, people might want to wait. You could have a buyer strike, right? I mean I don't know. I don't know if you have any views on that, like of whether we could have an accelerated replacement demand based on safety and at the margin, uninsurable cars which could create some dislocation in the market. I don't know if you would care to comment on that. Maybe it's another topic, but I just had one other follow-up question.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Sure. Well, I'm not sure I fully understand the last part of your question. I would just say at the end of the day, we've been booking north of $1 billion of active safety programs per year over the last four years and we'll do that this year as well. And our active safety business will grow close to 40% this year and revenues in active safety will be north of 40% next year. So we see a tremendous ramp-up in active safety sales, something that our customers are asking for. It's something that consumers are pulling. It's helping OEs sell cars and I think that's really important.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. All right. Just one final question then, you mentioned a outlook for 2017 of flat global light vehicle production. While you may be able to handle that kind of environment while growing margins 30 or 40 basis points and you can handle, let's say, only 150 bps of margin absorption with a 10% decline, your customers, your OEMs are, let's say, unfortunately, not in as good a position. They tend to see margins drop pretty significantly when we go flat. So I guess with that, if that historic, and we've seen this time and time again, if that trend holds, what are your expectations for increased pricing pressure? I know it's always hard and we know the communication on that, but could you not bake in a bit more aggressive price downs than we've seen over the last cyclical period of low- to mid-single-digit global production growth into next year?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, listen, I'll start and Joe, you can follow-up my response. Listen, I think one thing is you look at flat vehicle production where we sit today versus where we sit historically, I think there are two factors that you need to consider. And I can't quantify it for you, but I think they're qualitative and they translate to quantitative. One is, our OEs, from a cost structure standpoint, are in a better position than they've been historically. And I think that certainly is an incremental benefit.","Two, I think when you look at vehicle mix, they're in a position where vehicle mix is better than what it's historically been. So there's some element of buffering. Listen. I think as the market gets more challenged, we'll always potentially get more challenging from a pricing standpoint. Yeah, it's possible. That's why Joe made the comments, and I've made the comments, in addition to our discussion about product portfolio and growth, we're always focused on our cost structure so that to the extent, if price downs do go up and we need to respond to that, we have the ability to absorb that and still deliver strong margins.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, I would echo that, Adam. We're always focused on the potential for things like additional price and how to deal with them in the cost structure. And to be honest with you, and I know you mentioned this, but we hear price all the time, right, and price from customers is just as loud when volume's going up. And they view us as benefiting from higher volumes and they want some of that back. So it's a constant dialogue. And again, we often comment, the way we address things like price or things like volume is really continued focus on the cost structure.","Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, Joe.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks for taking my question.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Morning, Ryan.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Most of the suppliers with commercial vehicle and off-highway exposure that have reported so far this quarter, they've pointed to much softer than expected end market conditions. Is that what you're seeing as well, and do you have a view on when it might bottom?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","We are seeing that as well. Our CV in the quarter was down about 4%, and we expect for the full year to be about 3% down for the year. So we are seeing that. I think on the bottom, at this point, 2016 was certainly lower then we were originally expecting. At this point, from a planning presumption, we're expecting 2017 to be down slightly as well, just as we go into this and want to make sure we're prepared.","For us, it's I think the \u2013 and it's off-road cycle in particular is a little tougher to call the bottom, just given that's a unique market whereas assets are not being, assets, when things slow down, assets actually get parked and are not necessarily utilized. So even as the market starts to come back, you do have a little bit of catch-up on those assets before the replenishment cycle starts. So we are seeing that. That is consistent with our view.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then kind of unrelated but still on commercial vehicles, does your partnership with Mobileye extend to commercial vehicles also? Or are you otherwise going after the business? I ask because there seems to have been a pickup in interest recently regarding autonomous trucks, maybe especially after Uber's famous autonomous beer delivery, so just curious if you're doing anything there?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Listen. Our partnership with Mobileye is really focused on passenger car. But having said that, Ryan, we've been focused on the commercial vehicle and been having dialogues with several of the commercial vehicle manufacturers about automated driving. And I'll tell you, I wouldn't say that's a new phenomenon, to be candid with you. I think given, again, given the fact that they have a commercial interest in fuel economy, they have a commercial interest in increased safety and driver productivity, we've been working with several CVs actually over the last couple years with respect to adoption of automated driving technologies in that space.","Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Very interesting. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Hey, Joe. How are you?","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Morning, everyone. Good. How are you?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Good.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","First question, just going back to R&D, so clearly, a lot of interest, a lot of excitement and a lot of rapid change, which is why you were talking about some higher levels of R&D or engineering. But I was wondering if, and maybe this is a little bit more difficult to quantify, the level of reliance that your customers are putting on you, for electrification or connectivity or active safety, has that increased do you think over the past year or so?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, I think \u2013 listen, let me start with overall, I think the reliance on, one technology; and two, probably as important, maybe more important, systems integration, has gone up. And I think a great example for instance is the Multi-Domain Controller and the Integrated Cockpit Controller that we're working on. So I would say in general, it's gone up. Now there are some OEs who tend to want to do more on their own and I think you can guess who those are. There are others who are more likely to outsource that to suppliers like ourselves. So it varies a little bit by OE but I would say in general, it's drafted up.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay that's helpful. Second question is just on Hellermann actually. I'm wondering if we could get an update. Like if I look at your walks on sales and profit just on acquisitions, it looks like that margin was, even margin was a little under 12%. I think it's been there the past couple quarters. I think it's probably a little bit below what Hellermann did historically. So I was wondering if you could just provide us an update on that integration and the savings. And are those savings coming in in some other bucket? And then I guess related also, is the pound weakening a headwind there for that business or has it been a headwind?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Let me \u2013 listen, the business is doing great and the integration is actually ahead of schedule. I'll let Joe comment on the rest to your question.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, I think on that, on the acquisitions line in that bridge on 16, we also have reception systems coming out. So there is a little bit of depression on the margin.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","So that business is growing at 10%, which was in line. We were focused on 9% to 10% growth in the acquisition model. It's hitting its margin targets. Its historical margin trends and the synergy number, which was $50 million for 2018, we'll certainly be at that. And we're striving to be slightly above it on a run rate basis for 2018. So things are going well with that deal. It's a nice business; it's a good fit for Delphi and it's a very well run business, very strong management team that has remained with Delphi and continues to run that business.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lim from Wells Fargo Securities.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Hey, David.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just several questions on \u2013 and I apologize for being a little granular on this \u2013 the way we should think about the soft guidance for 2017 with the data points that you gave us. Do you \u2013 so we take the full year 2016 and then subtract the $250 million I think it was for is it the Mechatronics business?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yup.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then build up that way? Okay. Got you. And then longer term China NCAP 2017, any kind of preliminary idea of what they may institute and how that would impact your business as in a tailwind for maybe radar, camera et cetera?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, listen, it's I would say high level of confidence that they'll implement some element of NCAP, not completely sure what specific items. It will definitely be a tailwind for active safety and we expect to benefit from it. The reality is our bookings \u2013 we have some bookings, active safety bookings, in China, some more recently quite frankly. But it's not a big number that we're coming off of. So I would view that as longer-term potential upside.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then, Kevin, on the bookings that you've announced for Q3, any idea or can you give us some color on how active safety broke out in the quarter? Thank you.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, sure. Looking for \u2013 I have it here somewhere. Joe, you?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, active safety year-to-date is a little less than $900 million of bookings.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. Thank you so much.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. Good morning. I know we talked about 2017 a bit. I was hoping maybe to get a little bit of an update on how you're thinking about the 2018 targets that were provided at the April Investor Day?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, Itay we're still working through the out year. Obviously I think as we talk through things like market and FX rates from a 2017 perspective, those would obviously carry through to the 2018 numbers. But at this point, we haven't really done much beyond that as we work through 2017.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. And then back to 2017, given the uptick in restructuring spending this year, how can we think about kind of the net performance relative to pricing in 2017? Is that potentially a bigger source of margin expansion for you next year?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, certainly was. We took actions this year. We took actions earlier in the year, planned actions. As I talked about, we accelerated them, particularly the closure of a Powertrain facility in Western Europe. We continue to work our overhead structure down and that all accrues to the benefit of 2017. And for us, it really goes back to what I was talking about and we're in the process now of how much do we reinvest in the business alongside the growth that we're seeing while expanding margins. So for us it's we're doing that on the cost side to be able to do both, expand margins and invest appropriate levels in key technologies. And I think as you see in the growth rates in E&S this quarter at 17%, we clearly think there's opportunity there and quite honestly more opportunities down the road for just to be invested in.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, Itay, I think it's important and Joe did a good job explaining it. Listen, a lot of our focus on cost structure optimization is one, to offset price downs in economics, but to the extent we can drive incremental productivity, are there areas where we can make smart investments all of which are variable, by the way. It's not investments in brick-and-mortar or fixed cost but are there areas we can make smart investments that allow us to drive future growth?","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's helpful. And then just lastly, I think, Kevin, you mentioned seeing some customer interest for level IV or V offering you have with the Mobileye partnership. I was hoping we can talk a little bit more about that. And specifically, are you seeing kind of any interest to actually on-board in 2019? And then are your customers kind of looking to apply this system for more of a ride sharing environment initially, or kind of direct sale to consumers for level IV and V?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, listen, I think given the dialogues we're having with select customers, they could have them in their vehicles close to 2019 or before 2021, put it that way, given some of the dialogues we're working. So in terms of pulling it forward, obviously, what's critical is that our partnership begins working with OE sooner rather than later to integrate that. Whether it's with respect to ridesharing or those in their normal consumer fleet, I don't have an answer to that question. I don't know.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thanks so much, guys.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Morning, Emmanuel.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Morning.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Just wanted to drill down a tiny bit more on the diesel, I guess, the diesel mix risk going into next year. Do you have any sort of rule of thumb on content? I guess diesel, so you said diesel versus gas but let's say customers actually just replace their diesel vehicle with a GDi gas engine. What would be sort of the content impact for you?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, round numbers, Emmanuel, we've used $500 on the diesel side, $300 on the gas. So it's gas is roughly 60% of diesel generally speaking from a content perspective for us.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","So that $300 already included a GDi system on it?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah. Again, we work with averages here, right, because every OE is a little different, but think of it as 60% gas, GDi versus diesel.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Understood. And then just going back on the interest that you're seeing with the autonomous system with mobile, can you \u2013 the customers you're talking to about it, are they generally automakers looking to \u2013 specifically for a turnkey solutions and would like to sort of like invest less? Is there like a specific profile for interest in this system or is it generally it's part of overall autonomous discussion? And how do they go about deciding whether this is the right system or whether it would be something where they have more, I guess, direct involvement?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","It's both. Both OEs who would want a straight turnkey solution who historically, in the future, don't look at what they have in terms of resources or value add being development of a system and incorporating what they do with what we would do as well as work with some OEs who historically are very strong from a software standpoint, very strong from a technology standpoint, who would be involved in what it is that our partnership is doing. So there isn't a \"typical\", Emmanuel. It's kind of both ends of the spectrum.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. That's great to hear. And then just very quickly, on your electrification content opportunities, obviously very big potential increases versus the current Powertrain content. As some of these content based on early pricing, because that benefits from I guess being low-volume and therefore fairly high price but could see some meaningful price reductions as volume come up? Or do these content number already incorporate normalized volume assumptions?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, I would say it's fairly normalized at this point. Remember a big part of that for us is our Electrical Architecture content. So that is well known, the cost in the marketplace and the cost in the marketplace is well known for that. So there's a lot for us, electrification is important because it's very much our bread and butter, particularly as it relates to Electrical Architecture, so I would think of it as more normalized.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, Emmanuel \u2013 hey, Emmanuel, one thing I want to add to your question about diesel versus gas, and I think this is, it's really important. When you talk to our OE customers, especially on the European side, with respect to light duty diesel, to the extent there's a decline in light duty diesel penetration rates and there's an increase in gas direct injection, the reality is, without more light duty diesel, they can't meet the standards that are out there. So they're going to need to overlay increased vehicle electrification to achieve that.","So as we give you the trade-off between light duty diesel and GDi and, and Joe's spot on, it's kind of $0.60 on the dollar trade-off, you do really need to overlay some element of increased electrification, whether that's 48-volt, whether it's full hybrid or plug-in hybrid, whatever the case may be.","So I don't think the calculus is as simple as saying less light duty diesel penetration replaced with lower content gas direct injection. There has to be an electrification quantification that you need to roll into your assumptions to fully assess the impact.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","And is that need immediate, or can the automakers afford to wait a few years before one of those regulation milestone?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","No, If you look, the EU emissions regulations on CO2 is 2021, the fuel economy is 2025 in North America, so we're getting close and they certainly need to think through it. And then you've got the added complexity of, as additional content gets added to the vehicle, there is additional demand for electricity within the vehicle, which places more demand on the internal combustion engine. So things like 48-volt become relevant very quickly.","Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thanks for all the color.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Stover from SIG.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Hey, Matt. How are you?","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)","Thank you very much.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Hey, Matt.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)","Pretty good. You?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Good.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Good.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)","Hey, A detailed question, then just sort of a question, question. A detail on the reclassification, what product lines were in there? And then if we were to look at electrical, would there be other product lines that perhaps could be, from an outsider's perspective, classified within the context of Powertrain? In other words, are all of the Powertrain related electronics being reclassified?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","No. So the product would include things like controllers the software, inverters and converters, 48-volt driver module. Those would be the bulk of the product lines that have shifted out of E&S and into Powertrain.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)","Okay. But you said 48, did you \u2013 the inverters and 48...","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","The software module, just the software module. It's software.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)","Okay, so if we were to think about the growth in 48-volt systems would we think that some of that would accrue to the Powertrain and not just to E\/EA?","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yes.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yes.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yes, that would \u2013 power electronics, the growth we're seeing in power electronics would now be in Powertrain, yes.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)","Okay. The second question is a big picture question about the bookings data. If I look at your year-over-year bookings data, if I look at the long-term growth, it's a plus 10%. If I look at the quarterly number, it's down 29%. If I look at the rolling-four quarter, it's down 23%. If I look at the eight year-to-year figure for year-to-date, it's minus 18%, and I know these things are clumpy. I guess I just look at this data and I wonder what it is that we should be deriving from it, because it's so assumption-laden. And what is it that you want us as investors to walk away with?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, let me take \u2013 Matt, I think one thing that's in particular, we had a very large award in Q1 of 2015 that we've talked about since, you know, plus $3 billion in the quarter. So that does skew, and I would say when bookings are lumpy, timing from quarter-to-quarter is a little challenging. But that one was disproportionately large and is still affecting some of those year-over-year and quarter comps as you think through it.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, and, Matt, I would \u2013 a bigger picture. Listen, I think this is one indicator of the strength of the revenue line. You're right. I don't know if I'd call them assumptions at the end of the day. I'd call them a number of variables get factored into this, right, at a point in time.","It's global production, it's specific vehicle production, it's specific take rates within a vehicle, it's specific regions, foreign exchange, commodity prices, so you're absolutely right that it's not a simple calculation.","I think the way that I've kind of ultimately resigned to this is this is one of several indicators for revenue growth that guys like you ought to look at. It shouldn't translate dollar-for-dollar in any given quarter or any given year, but it's one thing to think about and to consider. It's one additional bit of information that we can give you guys to talk about what we're doing, what it is we're seeing from a technology standpoint, where our revenue should ultimately mix out to, what sort of product lines, and with what customers.","Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP (SIG)","Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thank you.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Thanks.","Elena Dom Rosman - Delphi Automotive Plc","We have time for just one more question.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","Hey, Colin.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted a clarification. So at the Investor Day, the long-term growth was 8% to 10% in a 2% market, which would mean in a flat market, you're at 6% to 8%. When you talk about mid-single, it seems to be either below or at the low end of the 6% to 8%. Does that mid-single include FX and the $250 million divestiture? I just wanted to clarify that that was maybe (01:00:09).","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","No, the way to think about it is we have had \u2013 you're looking for probably about four points of gross from your \u2013 the math, if you just think about the math you just said, right? So you're thinking obviously markets come down a couple of points.","We're also seeing, if you want to talk about like a couple of points, two to three points of program cancellations or \u2013 and\/or delays in take rates. So think of FCA. FCA has canceled past car programs in the past few months. The ramp on some of their MPV programs, their multi-passenger vehicle programs are slower out of the gates. That's probably \u2013 and then you think some of the things with GM and Ford, that's about two to three points of that. And then there's about a point of sort of positive offset there. So that's how you should think about that 4% coming down from the 8% \u2013 or let's call it, if we're 8% to 10%, right, we're at midpoint of 9%. We're now saying mid-single digits, call it midpoint of 5%, so that's the 4-point decline.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then it would be a little lower if you take out the divestiture?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yep.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And you commented earlier \u2013 I thought you said it was margin beneficial to get rid of it, but then it was $250 million, and you're taking out $70 million of EBIT, trying to...","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Growth rate, yeah, growth rate accretive. We've been saying for a long time that business has been shrinking. It will go down faster in our out years, and we've talked about that business being about two to three points of growth for E&S historically from a negative impact, from a headwind, from a growth rate perspective. So accretive from a growth rate perspective go forward, and it's very similar to what happened with Perception Systems. You de-emphasize the business, you stop putting money into that business for pursuit activities, for product development, for engineering, so the margin is higher, but you're dealing with a fairly significant decline in revenue.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","So going into next year, we think you have \u2013 the core business should take a step down? That's how we should model it out? (01:02:18)","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, probably you can model those \u2013 yeah, you should take those numbers out. Yep, that's the way to think about it.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And my last question I hope doesn't sound stupid. I'm looking at the restatement for the re-class for Powertrain and E&S. It looks like if I look at last year, sales for Powertrain are being re-classed up $7 million but EBIT down $9 million. How should we think about that? I'm trying to understand the re-class. Was it a money losing business that's being moved over? I find it \u2013 trying to think the sales on the EBIT's moving in the wrong direction.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Sure. We've talked about this. Power Electronics is a business that's growing significantly and ramping. It's just about hitting breakeven this year as it crosses the $100 million plus level and it really will be lumpy from a profitability perspective, very similar to active safety until it sort of hits that $300 million, $350 million. But it has hit breakeven a couple times this quarter. Last year it did lose money so there's a lot of investment in that business and relatively low volumes as we ramp on new programs. So this is at the heart of the electrification discussion, the 48-volt inverter, converter type business.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And the type of revenue you said $30 million of the annual growth?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, $30 million in the quarter.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, it's just in the quarter itself?","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","Yeah, yeah.","Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Okay. All right, thank you very much. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Joseph R. Massaro - Delphi Automotive Plc","No problem. Thank you.","Kevin P. Clark - Delphi Automotive Plc","All right, well...","Operator","That concludes the Delphi Q3 2016 earnings conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Delphi's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jessica Holscott, Delphi's Vice President of Investor Relations. Jessica, you may now begin your conference.","Jessica L. Holscott","Thank you, Lisa, and thanks for joining Delphi's third quarter earnings call. To follow along with today's presentation, our slides can be found at delphi.com under the Investors section of the website.","Please see Slide 2 for disclosure on forward-looking statements, which we'll be making on today's call and only reflect Delphi's current view of future financial performance, which may be materially different from our actual performance.","Joining today's call will be Rod O'Neal, Delphi's CEO and President; and Kevin Clark, our CFO. As seen on Slide 3, Rod O'Neal will begin the call with an overview of our third quarter, followed by Kevin Clark, who will review our financial results in greater detail, discuss our 2013 outlook. And then after Rod's concluding comments, we will open the line for Q&A.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Rod.","Rodney O'Neal","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.","Let's move right to the quarter. Please turn to Slide 5. Overall, we had a great quarter, although we remain cautious. The European market does seem to be stabilizing. Our revenues increased double digits. We have record third quarter earnings and margins, and earnings per share increased over 15%. During the quarter, we continued to invest in our future. For example, we expanded our presence out in Silicon Valley. I will share with you more details later, but we believe our presence in this center of innovation is going to pay some very good long-term dividends.","We continued to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders during the quarter, almost $175 million in total, including both dividends and share repurchases, bringing the total amount for the year to over $500 million. For 2013, we are confident that we will deliver 60 to 70 basis points of margin expansion and strong double-digit earnings per share growth, and we are committed to delivering shareholder value.","Please move to Slide 6. During the third quarter, we had the opportunity to spend some quality time with our customers at the largest automotive show on the planet, the Frankfurt Motor Show. And as many of you know, this show is a remarkable showcase of some of the most innovative automotive products in the world. During the show, we announced that RACam, Delphi's new cutting-edge integrated radar and camera system, will be introduced in the Volvo SPA platform in late 2014. In fact, product launches like RACam and others have accelerated growth in our Active Safety business, and we expect to have $1 billion in revenue from that portfolio in the next several years. We hosted a number of meetings at the Frankfurt event, and I came away very optimistic that our strength with our customers and the relationships we have built establish a bright future in the marketplace for us.","Please move to Slide 7. We are always developing innovative technology for Delphi, and time and time again, we are recognized for providing leading-edge solutions to the global automotive market. As you know, the Automotive News PACE Awards is a pinnacle of technology achievements among automotive suppliers. Three Delphi technologies have been named finalist for the 2014 PACE Awards as our engineering and research investments continue to hit the mark. We were also selected this quarter by Thomson Reuters as 1 of the top 100 most innovative companies for 2013, and this is the second year in a row we've achieved this recognition.","These accomplishments demonstrate the type of innovation for which Delphi has long been recognized. Our team is keenly focused on remaining at the forefront of innovation. As I mentioned earlier, we recently expanded our presence in Silicon Valley so that we can introduce even more technology solutions to our customers. There's a long list of companies, as you know, at the top of the game in the connectivity space, and we are establishing relationships with them that we believe will lead to significant future revenue. Delphi is one of the few companies that can make the future automotive technologies happen and deliver that technology flawlessly around the world. So we're working with partners in the Valley to really create some magic out there.","Slide 8. I can't talk about innovation and growth potential without touching on the amazing opportunity that Delphi has in China. We recently held our China Investor Day, which gave our Asia Pacific team an opportunity to share their remarkable growth story. I was there for the event and also spent a significant amount of time meeting with our local management team and reviewing our strategic plans for the coming years. I'm extremely proud of the team's accomplishments, and I continue to be extremely optimistic about Delphi's future in China, which is the largest automotive market in the world.","Last year, we doubled our revenues there over the last 5-year period, and we're going to roughly double revenues again in the next 5 years. We have 2 new sites scheduled to open in China next year for wiring and powertrain and we're going to expand 2 other sites. Delphi has established an unmatched competitive position that has translated into remarkable growth and profitability, and it's all because of the strength of our local team. They are simply the very best of the best. All the companies are now scrambling to put in place what Delphi's management team has had for more than 2 decades. Our presence in China is a key component of our long-term growth trajectory.","Slide 9. We've been awarded nearly $19 billion in new bookings through the third quarter, in line with our internal expectations, and we are well on our way to meeting our target for the full year. In fact, in October, we won roughly an addition of $2.5 billion in bookings. We expect to continue to see an acceleration in the pace of bookings during the fourth quarter. A few of the highlights of our Q3 bookings includes a global platform for Ford for engine wiring, a VW award for infotainment here in North America and a [indiscernible] award for diesel common rail in China. And as you can see, we continue to increase the geographic diversification of our business during 2013.","Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to cover the numbers. Kevin?","Kevin P. Clark","Thanks, Rod. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering our third quarter results. Then we'll discuss full year guidance.","Consistent with our prior earnings call, today's discussion will exclude all restructuring costs to provide clear visibility into the underlying operating performance of the business. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are included at the back of both the press release and this presentation for your reference.","So let me start on Slide 11 with a snapshot of our third quarter financial performance. As Rod already mentioned, our results were very solid, reflecting strength in North America and Asia, cost controls and strong operating performance, which translated into strong margins and earnings growth. The quarter played out largely as we anticipated. We're seeing signs that the European passenger car market continues to stabilize. However, the commercial vehicle market is more challenged than we had previously expected. Considering the various puts and takes, we remain cautious about the macro environment, but as we look to the fourth quarter, we expect our growth rates and margins to continue to improve.","For the quarter, revenue totaled $4 billion, that's up 10%. Adjusting for FX, commodities, acquisitions and divestitures, revenues increased 3%, roughly in line with markets served. EBITDA grew to $566 million, and EBITDA margin expanded 90 basis points to 14.1%, both records for the third quarter. Operating income reached $428 million, and operating margins expanded to 10.7%, that's a 60-basis-point increase, including the additional depreciation and amortization from the MVL acquisition. Net income totaled $302 million, and earnings per share increased over 15% to $0.97. And lastly, cash flow totaled $230 million, allowing us to continue to execute our capital allocation plan.","With that as backdrop, move to Slide 12, and I'll review revenue in more detail. So as I already mentioned, revenue increased over $350 million or 10% to over $4 billion. Price downs of 1.6% and lower commodity pass-throughs, primarily related to copper, presented a combined $69 million or almost a 2-point headwind to year-over-year growth. FX added $46 million to revenues and over one point to our underlying growth rate. Volume growth totaled $171 million, adding 5 points to our growth rate. And the MVL acquisition added roughly $200 million of revenue or 6 points of growth.","On a regional basis, European revenues were down 5%, largely in line with our expectations, reflecting continued improvement across each of our segments. North American revenues increased roughly 9%, partially driven by the benefit of the transition to the K2XX platform. Asia continued to be our fastest-growing region. Revenues increased over 10%. In that region, China revenues increased 12%, primarily driven by strong growth with the multinational OEMs. In South America, revenues decreased 2%, reflecting the performance of our customer base in that region, as well as initiatives to improve business mix and drive increased profitability in the region, which continues to show improvement.","Slide 13 reconciles the year-over-year change in EBITDA, which increased $83 million or over 17% to $566 million, representing flow-through on higher revenue, cost control, solid operating performance and benefits from the MVL acquisition, partially offset by unfavorable product mix, price downs and increased investments in growth engineering and information systems. As I already mentioned, EBITDA margins expanded 90 basis points to 14.1%.","Slide 14 details our segment results. Electrical Architecture continued to be our fastest-growing segment with adjusted revenue up over 8% from the prior period, driven by strong double-digit growth in North America and Asia, partially offset by relatively flat revenues in Europe. Segment EBITDA increased to $309 million, representing 15.8% EBITDA margins, that's up 270 basis points from prior year, the result of the MVL acquisition, flow-through on revenue growth and continued strong operating performance.","Revenue in our Powertrain segment totaled just over $1 billion, that's down almost 5%, primarily the result of a double-digit decline in European revenues due to continued lower sales of light-duty diesel fuel injection system. Segment EBITDA declined $27 million to $142 million, and EBITDA margins totaled 13.5%, the result of lower volumes. However, after adjusting for favorable warranty expense in the prior period, margins were roughly flat on a year-over-year basis.","In our Electronics and Safety segment, revenue totaled over $689 million, that's a 6% increase from the prior period, largely the result of double-digit growth in Asia and North America, partially offset by flat revenues in Europe. Segment EBITDA increased to $100 million, and EBITDA margins expanded 200 basis points to 14.2% due to flow-through on higher revenues, the benefits from restructuring initiatives and engineering rebuilds.","Lastly, as expected, Thermal revenues declined 1% to $368 million. Segment EBITDA totaled $15 million, and EBITDA margins decreased to 4.1%, the result of lower revenues and increased expenses related to unusually high launch activity during the quarter that will continue into the fourth quarter.","Turning to Slide 15. Earnings per share increased $0.13 or over 15% to $0.97, driven by increased earnings and a lower share count, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization and a higher tax rate, which is 21% for the quarter versus 16% in the prior period.","Moving to Slide 16. We ended the quarter with more liquidity and a stronger balance sheet. Debt totaled $2.4 billion, and net debt was $1.4 billion. That's roughly 0.6x LTM EBITDA. Year to date, we've generated roughly $1.1 billion of operating cash flow, primarily the result of increased earnings and lower cash taxes. We used our cash flow to fund $500 million of CapEx and returned over $500 million of cash to shareholders through share repurchases, as well as dividends.","Slide 17 details the assumptions underlying our 2013 guidance. Based on customer build schedules and IHS, we are forecasting global production of over 86 million units, which represents about a 2% increase in global production, in line with our prior outlook. We're now forecasting European production of just under 19.4 million units, that's down 2% to 3% versus last year. We continue to see signs of European passenger car market stabilizing. However, the commercial vehicle market remains challenging, primarily in Europe. As a result, we remain cautious and expect fourth quarter production to be flat relative to the same period last year.","Turning to Slide 18 to discuss our 2013 full year guidance. We've narrowed our range to the low end of our previously issued guidance. Consistent with the outlook we shared in our second quarter earnings call, beginning in the fourth quarter, we expect to see year-over-year revenue growth in Europe and the mix headwinds associated with the industry trend of lower diesel and high-end infotainment system take rates to be largely behind us. A portion of the revenue growth we expected from the improvement in these trends, and the launch of new programs will be partially offset by continued softness in commercial vehicle markets, again principally in Europe.","In addition, a few customers recently reduced their build schedules, one in response to their internal labor issues and the others to balance year-end inventory levels, which will negatively impact our light-duty diesel business in Europe. At this point in time, we don't have enough visibility to build schedules to estimate the possible impact of these items on our 2014 revenue outlook, but as Rod's already mentioned, we remain confident in our ability to deliver solid revenue growth. In addition, we continue to reduce our cost structure to maximize margin expansion and drive very strong earnings growth.","For the 2013 calendar year, revenues are now expected to be $16.3 billion to $16.4 billion. That's based on our current build schedules, representing 5% revenue growth or roughly 1% growth excluding FX, commodities and acquisitions. We expect EBITDA to be in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.37 billion, reflecting 10% EBITDA growth and 14.4% EBITDA margins. We continue to plan for non-GAAP full year tax rate of 18%, 17% on a GAAP basis. We expect EPS to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.35 per share, which translates to roughly 12% EPS growth. We continue to expect cash flow before financing of $1 billion with capital spending of $700 million. Shares outstanding are soon to be 312 million.","With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Rod before we go into Q&A.","Rodney O'Neal","Turning to Slide 20, to wrap up before we go to Q&A. Again, we had another solid quarter with both top and bottom line expansion. January will be here before you know it, and we are focused on the opportunities in 2014. So based on vehicle sales trends, which continue to grow, particularly in North America and China, and appear to have stabilized also in Europe, our current production expectations are for an increase of about 2% to 3% in global production, including European production being flat to up 2%. However, as you are all well aware, the macros can quickly change, and therefore, we will remain proactive on the cost side by further optimizing our business model so that we can continue to support our long-term margin goals. In this type of macro environment, we would expect solid revenue growth, increased margins and double-digit earnings per share growth. We will continue to be very disciplined in terms of allocation of capital to ensure we further drive shareholder value.","With that, we'll open it up, the call, for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just want to get a sense of the puts and takes within the margins of 2 segments that seem to diverge from historical patterns. First, on E\/EA, very strong margin of 15.8%, that's getting near your long-term guidance of 16%. We saw similar strength at Lear, which, if anything, is less exposed to higher-margin connector business. So question one is, kind of, can you comment on the margin trends there and whether it might be upside to the 16%? And on the other hand, Powertrain came in lighter than we were looking for. Is this a question of diesel mix in Europe, CB [ph] builds in Europe, where I thought there was a prebuild going on? And what does this mean for the Powertrain margins going forward?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. Brian, why don't I start? As it relates to E&S performance, and we talked about it previously, strong operating performance benefits from the restructuring initiatives, as well as quite frankly, timing of engineering rebuilds. So that is a business that, at the end of the day, you can see some variability quarter-to-quarter based on where we see those engineering rebuilds. As it relates to the E\/EA, again continued strong operating performance. We talked about the MVL integration, the synergies associated with it being a bit ahead of schedule, other benefits associated with this increased mix of connectors. So that's been the primary driver there. As it relates to the Powertrain business, as we talked about previously, that's a business that has relatively high decremental margins, especially on the diesel side of the business. We did see year-over-year reduction in revenue and a corresponding decremental margin rate. That's in line with what we'd normally expect or talk about. In addition to that, when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, if you recall, our Q3 call last year in that period, we had a warranty benefit associated with warranty expense of roughly $20 million or $25 million that we talked about. So if you adjust for that on a year-over-year basis, margins are actually relatively flat in that Powertrain business partially benefiting from some of that restructuring cost reduction initiatives that we've been pushing through this calendar year.","Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And going into fourth quarter, any major directions and margins in each of the segments you're implying?","Kevin P. Clark","We would expect to see improvements in margins across roughly every one of our segments. With the exception of the Thermal business, we expect those margins to be flat to up slightly.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So your fourth quarter guidance on the top line is 6.7% and 9.3% top line growth. We're coming up with roughly 3.5% to 6% organic. Is that about right for the fourth quarter?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, for fourth quarter, we would say roughly 6% organic growth, Rod.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","6% at the high end of your -- or is that the...","Kevin P. Clark","6% at the midpoint.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","At the midpoint, okay. So I guess...","Kevin P. Clark","So 8% reported, roughly 6% organic.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So originally, it was -- you were expecting, basically, to achieve production growth plus 5%?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It looks like maybe now closer to production growth plus 4%. Is the difference basically the commercial vehicle drag?","Kevin P. Clark","The difference is really 2 things. A part of it is commercial vehicle drag. The other part relates to the pulled orders or pulled build schedules in the light-duty diesel business that I referenced. So it's actually a mix of both.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. And what are the implications for that as sort of as we look out to next year? I think Rodney on the last call had mentioned something about some push-out of backlog. The original backlog number you had was a little bit over $1 billion. But is there some takeaway that you'd want to pass along in a vis-a-vis the outlook for 2014?","Rodney O'Neal","Well, we'll come back and do 2014 in late January, but we remain very positive and optimistic in terms of the year-over-year performance that we think we'll see in our Powertrain business. And so as we deal with some of the temporary adjustments that the customers have made in the Q4 and Q3, we don't see those as sticky and we see us beginning to move northward, but I don't want to get into the details. We'll come back later, but directionally, we see 2014 as a very positive year for us.","Kevin P. Clark","Rod, if I could -- this is Kevin. If I could just augment that, so if you look at the impact in Q4, we estimate it to be roughly $75 million impact related to both the change in heavy-duty diesel or the softness in commercial vehicle, as well as the customer-specific matters in light-duty diesel. It's tough to say now just given our visibility to build schedules if or how much that impact could be into 2014.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And can you just remind us what percentage of Powertrain is the Europe diesel business? Obviously, it's quite large. And any change to -- you've been saying that you expected that business to get to something like $7 billion and 17% margin by 2016. Is there any reason to sort of reassess that?","Kevin P. Clark","No. We're confident that it is a very strong business in a very high-growth sector, and we're confident that it will be on a trend that grows significantly above market. I don't think we know at this point in time whether it's exactly going to be $7 billion out into 2016 or some amount slightly different from that.","Rodney O'Neal","But as you know and as we talked about, one of our key strategies that we have well underway and are executing currently is the rotation into Asia, specifically China. And that diversification of the diesel business regionally and customer base-wise, we think, will pay a huge dividends once it's totally in place.","Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And Europe accounts for what percentage of Powertrain today?","Kevin P. Clark","Europe accounts for roughly half of the Powertrain.","Rodney O'Neal","Just about half.","Kevin P. Clark","A little over half.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just first question on the CapEx dropping from $750 million to $700 million in the guidance. Does that have to do with sort of the slippage you're talking about or is there some more efficiency that you're getting on the CapEx side? I'm just trying to understand what the driver of the decline is.","Rodney O'Neal","Look, one of the things we do, and as I talked about many times as we spent time with the investment group, is we're very focused on making sure that we don't put capital in the ground ahead of the marketplace volumes. And so what you see is that our normal just being very disciplined and just dialing back some of the things as we react to what's happening out there. So I think it's just the model at work, the team being focused on making sure that we are always ahead of the curve from a margin perspective, as well as from a return on net assets. And so I wouldn't take much away from it other than the fact that we're just running the company the way it should be ran.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then if we look at Slide 9, you're talking about the backlog growth being roughly on pace with what you're looking at, it sounds like in October, you had a bunch of good wins there to get to, it like looks like, $21.1 billion. As we look at this slide, at the end of this year or sometime in January, do you think that those new business bookings will actually be higher than they were in 2012 or roughly equal? Just trying to understanding if you might be winning at a slightly slower pace than the last 2 years or actually a little faster?","Rodney O'Neal","Yes, yes. First of all, we are not -- actually, we're winning at a higher rate. This year was a little unusual if you go back and compare year-over-year starting back in the first quarter, if you recall. It's almost a reversal in terms of the opportunities that the customers had on the table. They were a lot lighter in the first 2 quarters, and now they're picking up pace. When we look at what's on the table for Q4, we would expect us to have a very similar quarter like we had in Q2, which will put us at, near or above what we did last year. But our win rate is actually better.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then just a last...","Rodney O'Neal","The only issue is will the customer actually finish the transaction with us in the quarter or will it slip into 2014. But again, it will be only a timing issue and nothing to do with the amount of wins.","John Murphy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's incredibly helpful. And then just a last question. On Page 12, the price downs in the quarter of down 1.6%. That's another really good performance for you guys. Are you seeing any shift here in automakers' willingness to pay for your technology and be less aggressive on price downs or is this sort of just more of the same and just good performance from your side? I'm just trying to gauge the pricing environment with your customers right now, which is pretty good.","Rodney O'Neal","It is good. And it's just more of the same of having something that you can price for in the marketplace, and above all, being able to defend what you have. And so there's no customer out there that has become benevolent in terms of like not asking for pricing. So we -- the market is what it is and it's been that way forever and I don't see it changing. I think what we have at work is a model that actually executes as it should, and we have technology that's in places where we are able to protect our margins. So nothing new there, just more of the same.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Rod, if I can just follow up on the backlog question. Can you share your target for 2013?","Rodney O'Neal","It's more or less what we did last year. It's hard to be specific, but directionally, what you'll see is what we did last year.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And just given that your bookings have increased every year since 2009 at a very healthy clip, the fact that you're going to be kind of flat versus last year is more anomaly of the macro rather than anything to do with the fundamentals of the business?","Rodney O'Neal","Yes, I mean, when you do the math, our win rate is actually higher. Again, it's just opportunities, and it ebbs and flows in terms of how the opportunities come to market. And with the macro, some of the customers have been slower to decide exactly what they're going to do when and where. But no, there's no concern there on our part, and we think we're going to have a heck of a year in this area, in this environment, and we're looking forward to 2014.","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And just lastly, your European assumption of 3% -- down 3% is probably a touch more conservative than some industry providers, IHS, et cetera. Do you feel like there is room for -- if IHS is right and it's probably down 1%, that you guys can do better with your guidance or does that get you to the high end of your guidance range?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, I -- Ravi, this is Kevin. I think based on what we see from our customers, what we receive in terms of build schedules and the conversations that we have day to day, we're highly confident in our estimates for European production level to any outside source. That's how I will answer.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citigroup.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to maybe drill down a bit into the broad leverage you may have next year on margins to offset your typical annual price downs. Kevin, I was hoping maybe you can share or at least quantify what some of the maybe launch cost issues in Thermal may be running this year that hopefully may not be as severe next year, as well as any restructuring savings you have and your ability to continue to drive efficiencies in the business just to offset price downs broadly next year?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, as Rod has talked about in the past, our business model and how we try to manage the business includes what we call basic blocking and tackling initiatives that are really driven to offset labor and other economics, as well as price downs with productivity initiatives that come from manufacturing productivity and material productivity and then productivity in engineering, SG&A and so on and so forth. So those are really all baseline blocking and tackling. In addition to that, augmenting that, you're aware that we implemented a restructuring plan late last year that we've been continuing to work on this year. That's going to deliver that and MVL synergies will deliver roughly $80 million in benefits. We'd say we'd be at the higher end of that range, quite frankly, this year given what we've done from an MVL standpoint. As we look into 2014 from a run rate standpoint, we previously said we're talking about incremental benefits of roughly $120 million that relate to both restructuring again in MVL, MVL synergies, based on where we are from a timing from a restructuring standpoint. There are a couple of programs that will lag into early 2014 that's probably a little bit closer to $100 million than it is to $120 million. So those will be the types of items, the restructuring initiatives, the MVL synergies. We're evaluating further opportunities to rotate our cost structure from Western Europe to Eastern Europe and North Africa. That would require more restructuring spend, and that's something we'd update you guys in the next earnings call.","Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just lastly, any updated thoughts on the tax rate going forward or is sort of 17%, 18% still sort of a good way to think about the next couple of years?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. Nothing new there. We're still comfortable with roughly 17%, 18%.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Lim from Wells Fargo.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. On the decline in Europe, when we look at it from an organic basis, can you sort of parse out the effects between light vehicle and commercial vehicle effects in what we've been hearing was Q3 production was a little better than anticipated? So I just want to see how that sort of affected your performance.","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. When you look at our European revenues on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, we were down 5% versus our estimate of market being down 1%. And that's for both passenger car as well as commercial vehicle. I would say 3 to 4 points of that relates, at least in our business, to light-duty diesel and passenger car with the balance relating to commercial vehicle and our heavy-duty diesel business.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then to follow up on that comment, Kevin, I just want to get an idea on diesel mix. Are you seeing a secular shift where gas engines are gaining more footage in Europe? Or is this just a blip for a quarter and then an inflection point might happen over the next 2 quarters? How should we think about that?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. I said in my opening comments, what we've seen over the last number of quarters, call it 4 to 6 quarters, is diesel take rates declining relative to vehicle production, which if you go back in history and look at it as markets slow, OEs tend to de-content vehicles. Our current view is that is effectively stabilized and we won't see take rates going against us beginning in Q4 of this year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JP Morgan.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You touched on some of the factors causing your European revenue to underperform the change in light vehicle production during the quarter, particularly a lot on diesel mix and commercial vehicle end markets. I'm curious how some of the other drivers that you called out last quarter might be tracking, like infotainment take rates or aftermarket demand, 2 things that are hard for us to understand from the outside.","Kevin P. Clark","Yes. Aftermarket demand, that was a business that year-over-year we've seen declining in Q3 that's basically flat on a year-over-year basis. As it relates to infotainment take rates, that's something that effectively, it was a negative impact on -- slightly negative impact on Q3 as we look at our forecast for Q4, and our customer orders, it stabilizes. So it will not be a headwind.","Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then there were a couple of sort of stand-out year-over-year contribution margin performances by segment this quarter. It seems Thermal had some pretty steep, I think almost 80% decremental margins. E&S was a very strong 40% incremental. And you talked about that a little bit, citing engineering reimbursements. I'm curious if there was anything maybe similar at the Thermal division but negatively impacting that. Why should the decrementals track as they did? Is it a South America inflation issue or what -- and maybe just kind of walk us through what's happening at Thermal and remind us of the plan to turn that division around?","Rodney O'Neal","Yes. On thermal, we're actually pretty confident in the management team there that as they bring on the new business with the launches, we see fourth quarter being somewhat flat, and then from there, we expect them to move north. And so there are some launch issues that the team has to do a better job on, and we expect them to, and we think the new management team will do an excellent job on that. So we're all over it. And that's basically what the Thermal issue is, just some of the launch issues.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just, Kevin, on the cash flow, if I look at the full year guidance and I look at the cash flow before financing that you've done year to date, it looks like you're saying about $425 million for the fourth quarter and then if you back out the CapEx guidance as well, with cash flow from operations of over $600 million, which seems quite impressive, is that working capital driven or can you just give us some of the drivers to the fourth quarter cash performance?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, it is primarily working capital timing. I would say given some cut-off in the third quarter, investment in working capital was higher than what we would typically expect to forecast in a more normalized period. And as a result of that, you see a rebound in Q4 and a significant improvement in working capital use.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Rodney, I mean, in drive train, longer term, you guys have talked about GDi growth. Can you just give us an update on some of the progress there in terms of wins or bookings? And how do you think you are positioned in terms of winning with the right customers? Can you give us a better sense of where some of that growth is coming from in the outer years?","Rodney O'Neal","Yes, we're well positioned. The technology has been well received in the marketplace. The bookings have been pretty incredible, particularly from a geographic spread. As you know, we started out here in North America. But now we are now installing capacity and capability, both technical and processing-wise, in Asia Pacific, especially China, as well as in Europe. We've been pretty bullish on the growth aspects of it. And it has been a solid, solid win in the marketplace, technically as well as commercially. So we feel very good about it.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So if some of the diesel penetration softness -- I know you said it stabilized, but if it doesn't sort of return, is there an offset from gas -- or from GDi picking up the slack?","Rodney O'Neal","Yes, there is. But the other thing -- just going back to diesel, one of the things we're going to do is not turn our back on Europe but begin to be more diversified geographically. And that's why you see us moving very aggressively into Asia Pacific, especially China. Tremendous amount of opportunity there. And while not turning our back in Europe, we're just going to outgrow Europe in Asia, and that's going to help the diesel top and bottom line. And then obviously, GDi is going to be another diversification because of the product. So we feel the strategy is well in place to continue to drive northward in terms of margin and top line in Powertrain, and we're pretty excited about the possibilities and what this asset could do for Delphi.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just one point of clarification. When you're giving some of the margin color by segment for the fourth quarter and you said improvement all around and maybe flat in Thermal, is that on a year-over-year basis or sequentially?","Kevin P. Clark","That is actually both.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt Stover from Guggenheim.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been addressed, but I was wondering if you could scope the size of the engineering recovery in E&S, and then I have a follow-on question for Thermal.","Kevin P. Clark","Matt, that's not something that we disclose on a quarterly basis for a variety of reasons.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Some will have to deal with next year, because you presumably want to have a similarly sized recovery in the quarter next year?","Kevin P. Clark","I'm not sure that, that's actually true just given timing. And that's something that, quite frankly, we are, as a company, focused on increasing engineering rebuilds to the extent it's something that we can certainly do. So it's certainly an area of focus in terms of reducing cost or to fund growth investment.","Matthew T. Stover - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. The second question on Thermal, Rodney, I understand that year-over-year decline in the margin there is, I guess, associated with revenue leverage in the business and the launch issues. But stepping back, when you look at that business sort of globally, the business itself has some structural issues that affect the margin structure of a number of players in that business. I'm wondering if you could kind of describe to us what it is that will contribute to that business earning sort of a more Delphi-like margin and how we should think about there being a -- sort of the realistic timeframe for the accomplishment of that typical...","Rodney O'Neal","That's a great question. Let me frame up with you where I see the business, where it should probably operate. It should be in double-digit margins from an EBITDA perspective, 10% to 12% range. We're thinking more 12% than 10%, but in that range. The reason that -- it will never be 15%, but it has tremendous leverage from an asset perspective because it doesn't use the same type of engineering resources nor capital. So the return on invested capital is the leverage is huge once we hit full stride and what's going to get us back to where we need to be. One is the new team has to execute better. There is one. But above all, the bookings that we've had with some very powerful customers that historically Delphi has not been in the portfolio both in Europe, as well as some of the aging customers here in North America. When you look at the rate of year-over-year revenue that we expect to have out through the 2016 time period, it will have one of the highest growth rates in all of Delphi. So that's got to get executed, and that's where the new team is all over what needs to be done to get the ball moving forward. So that's how we're going to get there. It's what we need to do. And the end game is going to be in the 10% to 12% EBITDA margin range.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you clarify the comment earlier that the MVL synergies and restructuring savings are running around $100 million? And then it seems to be pushing into -- the $120 million is really more next year? Is that a run rate we're exiting for this year?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes, right. So look, Colin, what we said is when you look at MVL synergies and restructuring savings, that we do roughly $60 million to $80 million in 2013. And then from a run rate standpoint, we generate roughly $200 million in 2014. So that would be an incremental $120 million. What I said is there are a couple of programs in Europe that are running a little bit behind schedule given work counsel approval, and that $120 million, if you were to ask us now, where we'd strike the line, we'd say, it's probably closer to $100 million of incremental savings looking into 2014.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And the actual savings...","Kevin P. Clark","Did that answer your question?","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, it definitely helped. And then the actual savings this year is $60 million to $80 million?","Kevin P. Clark","The actual savings this year is much closer to $80 million.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then obviously, the diesel mix in commercial vehicle in Europe had some big issues. Any color on the market? How does diesel look year-over-year as a percent of the European market and how about just from your perspective of where in Q3 and the next quarter commercially Europe will look?","Rodney O'Neal","I think if you look at the mix of diesel penetration on an overall European basis, it's down about a point. And I think it went from 53% to 52%. Don't hold me to that, but I think I'm pretty accurate.","Kevin P. Clark","It's 1 point or 2.","Rodney O'Neal","It's 1 point or 2, it might be 2 points. And I guess it's to be expected in terms of -- because of the lower end of the portfolio, the fleet in Europe has been deeply impacted with the recession that's occurred there. And diesel was a big player in the lower-end vehicles. And as some of the vehicles have been de-contented, that was one of the natural spots to take cost out. And so I don't think there's anything surprising about it other than the fact that some of the customers made some adjustments that we didn't see when we talked to you guys back in the third quarter. It became very evident as we looked into the second half of the year as time moved on. So nothing that we see is permanent, and we're expect things to return -- now that Europe has stabilized and we don't see it further deteriorating.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And on the commercial vehicle side? I mean, is that trending down sequentially from Q3 to Q4?","Kevin P. Clark","Sequentially?","Rodney O'Neal","Hold on a second.","Kevin P. Clark","On a sequential basis, Colin, it's roughly -- on a global basis, it's up a couple of points in Europe. It's -- based on our numbers, it's largely flat -- up slightly, up very slightly.","Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On commercial?","Kevin P. Clark","Yes.","Rodney O'Neal","All right. Let me wrap up. Again, Delphi had a very solid quarter. We are focused on bringing value to the shareholders as always, and we will continue to deliver innovative technologies to our customers. I continue to be very optimistic about Delphi's future. I want to thank you all for taking the time to join us today. Please stay safe.","Operator","This concluded Delphi's third quarter 2013 earnings release conference call. Thank you for joining.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Delphi Technologies' Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sherief Bakr, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sherief, please go ahead.","Sherief Hassan Bakr - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thank you, Jonathan, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to Delphi Technologies' second quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today in London are our Chief Executive Officer, Liam Butterworth; our Chief Financial Officer, Vivid Seghal; as well as our Chief Technology Officer, Mary Gustanski.","This call will include the discussion of our second quarter financial results as disclosed in today's press release, as well as our updated outlook for 2018. In order to follow along with today's presentation, you can find an accompanying set of slides on our Investor Relations website at ir.delphi.com. Please note that our discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to their corresponding GAAP measures in the tables within our press release.","Now, before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q, as well as other filings with the SEC. I would encourage all of you to review these risk factors listed in these documents.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Liam.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thank you, Sherief. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call. I'll start by taking you through some of the highlights of the quarter and the continuation of the momentum we have in the market. I'll then spend a few minutes updating you on the drivers of our long-term growth and how our strategy and portfolio of technologies are fully aligned with our market opportunity. Vivid will then take you through more of the details of our second quarter performance and our updated outlook for 2018.","On slide 3, you can see some of the highlights for the quarter. Similar to the first quarter of the year, our bookings performance in Q2 was a significant highlight for the team. $2.3 billion of bookings in the quarter and $5.3 billion for the first half of the year is a reflection of the strong demand we continue to see in key areas across the portfolio and reinforces the strategic choices we have made to support our customers across the globe.","Despite some of the shorter term revenue headwinds we are seeing, our bookings momentum over the last several quarters, coupled with the pursuits we are actively engaged in, reinforces our conviction around the long-term strategy and portfolio choices we have made. And on a full-year basis, we remain well on track to exceed our record bookings performance of $7.1 billion from last year.","Turning back to our Q2 performance. Revenue growth of 1.1% was lower than we had planned, largely driven by softness and the timing of certain customer programs in China and North America. I'll come back to this in my market comments in a few moments.","Offsetting this was another quarter of strong growth in key areas of our portfolio. Power electronics which grew by more than 45% and commercial vehicle diesel systems which grew by more than 20%. GDi revenues declined by approximately 10% in the quarter, primarily related to lower revenues in China and a higher year-over-year comparison from the prior year quarter when GDi revenues grew by more than 50%.","Despite the more modest revenue growth in Q2, we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 12.7%, a 10 basis points year-on-year expansion, reflecting rigorous cost control, as well as strong margin expansion from our Aftermarket business.","Operationally, we continue to make good progress and remain laser-focused on coming off the transition service agreements in a timely and cost effective manner. We are also continuing to invest in building our own appropriate standalone functional capabilities. Adjusted EPS of $1.29 benefited from some favorability and below the line items, and we generated a healthy $164 million of operating cash flow.","We also ended the quarter with a strengthened balance sheet, which allows us to continue with our balanced approach to capital allocation for organic investments in the business to drive long-term growth, selective bolt-on M&A, and returning cash to shareholders. As you will have seen, our board of directors has approved our first share repurchase authorization, which underscores my confidence in the long-term value creation potential ahead of us in addition to paying a quarterly dividend.","Turning to slide 4, we operate in a market where we continue to benefit from regulatory-driven and consumer demand for more efficient propulsion solutions to both passenger cars and commercial vehicles. In addition, we continue to see an acceleration in demand across the globe around electrification, especially for higher voltage solutions.","Our strategy and related technology and operational choices we've made over the last four years are fully aligned with these strong secular growth trends. And we have a portfolio of technologies that span across the full range of propulsion systems, a global engineering and manufacturing footprint that's fully aligned to our customers and markets served, as well as a software and systems capability that differentiates us from our competitors. Related to this last point, we recently hosted a Software and Systems Teach-In for the investment community led by Mary Gustanski, our CTO. For those of you unable to dial in, I would really encourage you to listen to the replay on our Investor Relations site.","In addition, we have a disciplined commercial strategy focused on the leading global OEMs, as well as the larger domestic manufacturers in China. For all of these customers, having the best and most innovative technology has become increasingly important, and we continue to invest significantly in both engineering and manufacturing capacity to support our customer needs.","Over the course of the second quarter, I continued to visit a number of key customers across the globe. And the feedback and level of engagement has been extremely positive about Delphi Technologies' ability to support them today and in the future. Customers continue to appreciate the clarity of our strategy and our ability to partner with them to solve their most difficult propulsion challenges.","Looking at some of the market trends in the second quarter, I'll focus my comments on China as this is where we had the majority of our revenue shortfall. Approximately half of our revenues in China are derived from domestic OEMs, many of whom made significant buildups in Q2 due to softening of their market share versus the major global OEMs, as well as some of the larger local manufacturers.","While we were able to offset some of the decline by stronger growth in our commercial vehicle business, particularly in medium-duty trucks, this resulted in lower than expected overall revenues in China for the quarter. As we look out into the rest of the year, we expect this softness in China to continue into the third quarter before new GDi launches are expected to drive stronger growth for us in Q4.","Over time, and as reflected in the bookings we've made in the past few years and our disciplined commercial strategy, we expected our mix of revenues in China to be much more weighted towards the larger local and global OEMs. This pace of transition will obviously be an important driver of growth for us in China going forward.","On the bottom of slide 4, and similar to last quarter's presentation, we've highlighted some of the industry related headlines that have been particularly topical. Over the course of this year, we've seen a number of macro political and regulatory related topics that have created a lot of discussion and added some uncertainties to our industry going forward.","At a high level, an important characteristic of our business is that we have a balance in our portfolio, customer mix, and a localized footprint which mitigates our exposure to any one single market driver. That said, we've incorporated some incremental headwinds into our second half outlook which Vivid will discuss in his comments.","Turning to slide 5. Building on our strong momentum in the marketplace over the past couple of years, our bookings performance in Q2 was again a highlight and reflects our customers continued recognition of the technologies and value we provide. While the nature of quarterly bookings tends to be lumpy, $2.3 billion of lifetime revenue booked in Q2 was a strong result. Coupled with the $3 billion of bookings in Q1, we ended the first half of the year of $5.3 billion, slightly ahead of where we expected to be. And our win rates to both conquest and incumbent business also continues to be higher year-on-year. And on a full-year basis, we're well positioned to deliver another year of record bookings in 2018.","And as I mentioned on our earnings calls in the past, investing to support our long-term organic growth opportunity in both OpEx and CapEx remains the top priority for us. I continue to be pleased with the balance of our bookings between our electrification and internal combustion engine technologies. And this only not underscores the strength and depth of our portfolio but is also fully aligned to the market drivers I referenced on the previous slide.","Looking at some of our key wins in the quarter, for the internal combustion engines technology segment there were a number of highlights. We bought multiple 350 valve GDi programs with both global and leading Chinese OEMs for their next generation engine platforms, as well as a significant commercial vehicle diesel system with a major Chinese OEM.","For electronics and electrification, our differentiated technologies, systems and software expertise continue to help us win in the marketplace. In Q2, we secured multiple bookings for our high voltage inverter and onboard charging products. And we continue to see significant pursuit activity in the marketplace with customers in all our major regions.","Turning to slide 6, which really highlights the acceleration and momentum we have in the marketplace. In three key strategic areas of the portfolio: power electronics, gasoline fuel systems, and commercial vehicle diesel systems. This is fully consistent with the long-term market drivers and aligns with our investments to capture the significant incremental content opportunity ahead of us.","In total, since 2011 we bought more than $19 billion in lifetime revenues in power electronics, GDi, and commercial vehicles diesel systems, of which are around 70% was won since the end of 2014. For power electronics, we've seen the steepest acceleration, with more than $3 billion of bookings since the start of 2017.","The strong momentum we have seen across all three areas of the portfolio reinforces our confidence in the long-term growth potential. So, in summary, and before I turn the call over to Vivid, in our first full two quarters as a public company, we've made tremendous progress, successfully completing the spin and continues to have great bookings momentum whilst also executing our strategy to transition the business to meet the future propulsion requirements of our customers around the globe.","While I was not satisfied with our revenue performance in Q2, we delivered margin expansion and robust operating cash flow, reflecting strong operational discipline and rigorous cost control. In light of the recent macroeconomic and related industry uncertainty, we will continue to remain focused on disciplined and laser-focused cost control, leveraging our flexible operating model, and delivering robust operating cash flow while continuing to invest to support longer-term organic growth.","I'll now turn the call over to Vivid to take you through the financial in more detail and our updated outlook for 2018.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thank you, Liam, and good morning, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I'd like to start with a high level recap of our Q2 financials that you can see on slide 8. Before I get into the discussion of our year-on-year performance in Q2 and similar to the last couple of earnings calls, you will see that we have presented the prior year's results of both the pro forma and reported basis. The difference, $21 million of revenue and $17 million of operating income reflects the pro forma adjustments related to our separation and gives you the right starting point to compare our year-on-year growth in Q2.","Revenue of $1.2 billion in the quarter increased by 1.1% year-on-year. As Liam mentioned, our Q2 revenues came in below our expectations. This was primarily driven by lower sales in China from some of our local OEM customers.","Adjusted operating income of $156 million increased by $9 million year-on-year. This resulted in an adjusted operating margin of 12.7%, up 10 basis points year-on-year, as stringent cost control, the benefits from prior restructuring and some foreign exchange tailwind more than offset unfavorable product mix.","Adjusted EPS of $1.29 was aided by some below-the-line favorability. In addition, we delivered $164 million of operating cash flow, driven by improvements in working capital. Our operating cash flow performance remains a key area of our focus and we remain on track to deliver on the full year target that I provided back in February.","Turning to slide 9 which provides more detail on our revenue progression in the quarter. Looking at our Q2 revenue growth in more detail, we saw strong year-on-year growth in the key areas of our portfolio. Commercial vehicle revenues increased by more than 20% and power electronics revenues increased by more than 45%. Due to the phasing of sales with some of our customers in China, GDi revenues were down in the quarter, but remain on track for the full year.","We continue to see robust GDi demand, and we are accelerating our capacity investments to support our customer's needs across the globe. Passenger car, light-duty diesel revenues came in broadly in line with our expectations, declining by approximately 15% in the quarter or around a 200 basis point headwind to our overall top line growth. Similar to last quarter, this was primarily driven by the roll off of customer programs in Europe.","From a regional perspective, our Q2 revenue growth was driven by above market growth in North America, primarily from sales to commercial vehicle customers. Revenues in Europe increased by 2% year-on-year, as growth in commercial vehicle and GDi was offset by the ongoing decline in light-duty diesel revenues. Finally, our sales in China declined by 4%, driven by the softness I outlined earlier, as well as a challenging year-on-year comparison, following more than a 45% growth in China in Q2 2017.","Slide 10 walks through our operating income growth for Q2. Adjusted operating income was $156 million, up 6% year-on-year. This was primarily driven by a disciplined cost control and foreign exchange benefits, which more than offset price downs, unfavorable mix, and to a lesser extent, high commodity prices.","Turning to our segment performance on the next slide. On a year-on-year basis, Powertrain Systems revenue was essentially flat in the quarter, as strong growth in commercial vehicle and power electronics were offset by expected lower revenues in light-duty diesel and the decline in GDi. Passenger car light-duty diesel revenues declined by approximately 15% in Q2, as lower sales in Europe offset growth in India and other Asian markets.","European passenger car light-duty diesel sales were down approximately 20% year-on-year. This was primarily driven by program roll-offs and, to a lesser extent, lower market penetration. Adjusted operating margin of 12.3% was down 20 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to unfavorable mix, which more than offset good cost control, foreign exchange tailwinds and the benefits from prior restructuring.","Turning to our Aftermarket segment on slide 12. At the start of the year, I commented that we are focusing our Aftermarket business on higher margin revenue opportunities, in order to drive operating leverage. And I'm pleased with the progress we have made in the first half of the year. Revenue of $215 million declined by 1% as higher sales to independent Aftermarket customers was more than offset by lower sales through the OES channel. Adjusted operating margin expanded by 170 basis points year-on-year, driven by our commercial strategy and operational performance. As we look into the second half of 2018, we remain focused on delivering full year margin improvement compared to 2017.","Now, let's move to our updated expectations for 2018. Slide 13 outlines our revised outlook for the year. At a high level, we have narrowed our ranges for revenue and EPS from the top while our operating cash flow targets remain unchanged.","Starting with revenue. For the full year, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.1 billion, a tightening of $100 million from the top of our prior range or a 1% change in organic growth at the midpoint.","The updated revenue outlook is primarily driven by three factors, some of which were visible in our second quarter results. First, approximately one third of the impact from a stronger dollar. Our updated outlook for the year now assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.18 versus our previous $1.20 estimate. Second, just over one third from lower sales in China from smaller local OEMs, most of which was realized in the second quarter. And third, just below one third is from additional headwinds in Europe which are expected to be more prominent in Q3 related to the combination of the new emissions test requirements referred to as WLTP and a slightly faster roll off of our light duty diesel programs.","We continue to expect strong growth in 2018 in three strategic areas of our business: power electronics, commercial vehicle diesel, and gasoline fuel systems where our growth assumptions are essentially unchanged for the year. For power electronics, we'll remain on track to deliver more than 50% growth revenue in 2018. Full year adjusted operating margin is now expected to be in the range of 12.1% to 12.3% or a 20 basis points lower than our prior expectations, but still represents 20 to 40 basis points of margin expansion from our pro forma 2017 margin of 11.9%.","The change in adjusted operating margin is primarily driven by two factors: first, approximately 10 basis points from less favorable foreign exchange; and second, the impact of lower volumes and slightly more unfavorable mix, partially offset by continued disciplined cost control.","In addition, we have incorporated some incremental costs in the second half of the year related to commodities and tariffs. While we believe this covers our current risk for the year, we continue to monitor and evaluate changes in the overall macro and industry environments and the potential impact in the second half of 2018 and beyond.","For adjusted EPS, our outlook now calls for earnings per share in the range of $4.65 to $4.85 or a $0.10 tightening from the top of our prior range. The change is primarily related to less favorable foreign exchange. Note that our 2018 EPS outlook does not assume any share repurchases.","In terms of the other outlook metrics provided at the start of the year, we now expect restructuring expenses to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million in 2018, or $15 million lower than our prior expectation. This reduction in restructuring expense is expected to be offset by higher one-time separation costs of approximately $15 million. So, at an overall company level, the net impact of these two changes is expected to be minimal.","Though we are not providing a specific quarterly outlook for the third quarter, I wanted to provide you some color on how we see the phasing in the second half of the year. Starting with revenue, at the midpoint of our updated full-year outlook, we expect similar growth in the second half compared to the first half.","In terms of second half phasing, we expect stronger year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter compared to Q3, primarily due to the expected impact of continued revenue softness in China, as well as lower sales in Europe related to WLTP in Q3.","Turning to profitability and EPS, in line with our previous expectations, the updated outlook implies a lighter adjusted operating margin and EPS in the second half compared to the first. This is primarily related to significantly lower expected foreign exchange benefits, particularly compared to the first quarter, as well as previously expected higher spin-related cost, that we expect to incur in Q3 and Q4. From an EPS perspective, this is expected to be partially offset by a lower adjusted effective tax rate in the second half. We continue to expect the full year adjusted tax rate of 16% to 17%.","Finally, I wanted to update you on our balanced approach to capital allocation. Our priority continues to be delivering strong operating cash flow and investing in organic growth. For example, CapEx to support our bookings momentum and R&D focused on new technologies with the highest growth potential. The second half of 2018, we are accelerating our investments in GDi capacity to meet customer demand. And on a full-year basis, we now see our CapEx approximately $10 million higher than we previously expected. And while we continue to target returning CapEx to approximately 5% of sales in the longer term, we will assess our CapEx needs should there be a requirement to invest to support stronger growth and deliver long-term value.","Returning cash to shareholders remains an important option of our capital allocation strategy. And as you would have seen in today's press release, our board of directors has approved our first share repurchase authorization, in addition to continuing to pay a quarterly dividend.","So, in closing, while operating in a dynamic and more challenging market environment, we delivered margin expansion, healthy operating cash flow and had another quarter of strong bookings. And looking out to the second half of the year, we remain fully focused on delivering our targets for 2018. And for the longer term, we will continue to focus on cost control and cash generation, as we evaluate the macroeconomic trends and their potential impact going forward.","With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of David Leiker from Baird. Your question, please.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. This is Joe Vruwink for David.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Morning, Joe.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I'm wondering, I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but there's clearly some maybe issues around timing of when new programs launch over the course of 2018. Do you think Q3 probably ends up seeing a further deceleration in growth, just given some of the items you mentioned, weakness in local China customers, WLTP? And then you'd expect a pretty nice reacceleration and year-over-year growth by Q4, is that kind of a reasonable cadence?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Joe, hi. It's Vivid here. I think what you're going to find really in the sort of Q3 timeframe is some of the pressures that we started seeing in Q2 continuing for the full (25:46) quarter. So certainly, we will see the impact of WLTP coming in and a continuation of some of the China softness that we saw as well. On the flip side, we are going to see an acceleration of power electronics' revenue ramp-up in the second half of this year and a continued strength in our Aftermarket business that will pick up in the second half as well. So, I think you're going to see a pretty balanced first versus the second half, with some slight pressure in Q3.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. Hi, Joe. This is Liam. Maybe just to add a bit more color to what Vivid said. If I look at some of the program launches that we've got taking place throughout the year, clearly Q4, we've got some significant ramp-up in GDi as we launch with some global OEMs, specifically in China. And we continue to accelerate our capacity installation, both in Europe and in Asia, to support those new programs.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And then as I think about the above market framework you provided at the time of the separation, 2% to 3% growth above market is the goal. I think 2018 probably ends up being closer to maybe 1% above market growth. Would you still expect 2% to 3% to be the right number? So as we enter 2019, does that end up being a year where you're maybe above the 2% to 3% target to keep you within the framework?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. This is Liam. I think \u2013 a couple of things that I wanted to just kind of highlight really with regards to overall growth. So, there's two dynamics, as you know, that are taking place since we announced the spin last year. I think, first of all, a lot of changes going on in the macroenvironment and uncertainty around tariffs, WLTP, Brexit, and commodity prices. And at the same time, we continue to monitor very closely the evolution of the mix of our business with regards to light-duty diesel penetration, accelerated phasing of GDi capacity, customer program mix, and also our Aftermarket business. As we've stated a couple of times, we've been more focused on our Aftermarket business around margin expansion and growth.","So, we're in our business planning period at the moment, and clearly, we'll be providing more clarity around 2019 when we get closer to the end of the year. But I think the key thing really is in terms of bookings momentum, we really continue to see much stronger growth in bookings across the three key areas of our portfolio that Vivid alluded to on his section.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And then my final question, if all-in GDi growth for 2018 is unchanged and you're actually accelerating CapEx, so future growth is probably not unchanged, if anything better, I imagine there's going to be a question of whether that forecast assumes the China mix issues don't impact future growth on GDi. I know you said something about your customer mix being more evenly allocated on a go-forward basis. So, you think customer mix is maybe contained to 2018 and on a go-forward basis, you'd expect kind of normalization from this dynamic.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. I think that's a fair statement. Maybe just at a high level, I'll just give you a bit more color around what's happening in GDi specifically at the moment and what we've been seeing in the market from all of our customers is there's two dynamics taking place, all driven by regulation. One is that the pace at which light-duty diesel is falling off. And the second one is really the transition from PFI to GDi, and that's what's really driving us to accelerate our capacity installation, which is creating tension right through the supply base in terms of capacity that's on the market today. But clearly, as we look at our midterm guidance for GDi, we'll be providing more clarity on that as we go forward.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah, and certainly, the way to look at it is, if you think about the strength of GDi right now, we are not seeing any changes to our launches in GDi. And, in fact, our bookings have actually ramped up, hence, the reason why we're investing more CapEx at the end of this year. And I mentioned before that we may take the opportunity to further look at our investments, both in R&D and CapEx to ensure that we have sustainable growth and long-term growth. So, I would say launch on track, bookings above where we want to be, and in terms of our expectations, CapEx being provided to allow us to have long-term growth. So, I think on that basis, long term is looking good.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A first question and to follow up on the comments on China. Liam, in your discussion, it sounded like there was some issues with some of the smaller customers, and for that reason, you're really going to be focusing on larger international and domestic players. I'm just curious, how big a shift that is from your existing customer base? Can you play some bets on some of the smaller players that you think might be big players over time? And just how you're going to handle this because it sounds like, it's a bit of an issue. It's not disrupting you too much but it sounds like it's a developing sort of headwind here.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah, let me maybe just give some context. So, I would say at the moment our China business is probably exposed to around 50% with the local OEMs. And clearly that's something that we've been or will continue to evolve as we go forward. And if you look at our bookings performance, so in 2014, around 70% of the new business being booked was with that group of smaller OEMs. If I look at 2018 year-to-date, it's less than 30% which is really a reflection of the strong disciplined commercial strategy that we've been implementing to make sure that we're growing with the right OEMs in the right regions and clearly we've been focusing on the key winning OEMs in China to make sure that we rebalance our customer mix in that region and we're winning with the winning OEMs.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's something that makes a lot of sense. Is this the kind of thing that will create a headwind for the next year or two? Or given sort of your shift in strategy that this will be something that eases as we go through the course of this year and not be an issue in 2019, 2020, 2021, just curious how this plays out?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. We see a short-term headwind in Q2 and into Q3, but as Vivid alluded to, as we see some of our new GDi programs specifically launching in the fourth quarter of next year. For example, we've got some big programs launching with Volkswagen towards the end of the year and into next year, we'll see that mix shifting away from the local OEMs. So, it's more of a short-term issue than a longer term problem or a headwind for us.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great that's very helpful. Then a second question. You highlighted sort of stand-up in incremental overhead costs for being a stand-alone company as a headwind through the remainder of the year. What are the exact sort of numbers you're talking about there and how much do those fade and does this get solved in 2019?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","So, altogether, we haven't come off the numbers that we originally gave that the cost in terms of spin-related and standalone would be approximately $70 million for the full year. In terms of the phasing of that, about 40% of that was recognized in the first half, and about 60% will be recognized in the second half of 2018.","In terms of 2019, we haven't provided full clarity on that. We're going through the planning cycle right now. But we do expect further reductions and a roll-off of those costs as we come off the TSAs and actively go in terms of our cost discipline that we're currently looking at.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a last question, as you're going through bookings right now, I'm just curious if anything is changing in the quoting process around raw materials, specifically. I'm just trying to understand if it's sort of the escalators and indexing and everything else you've worked out with the automakers historically in these contracts, is still being set up largely the same going forward, or are you having to take on more of the raw material risk going forward than you have in the past?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","No. We're continuing with exactly the same commercial strategy and discipline around commodities for all of our new business pursuits that we have done historically. Clearly, in our financial models for those pursuits, we're reflecting revised commodity outlooks in terms of where we see the market evolving. But our strategy in terms of commercial protection on those contracts remains unchanged.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And could you just remind us what your biggest exposures are?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yes, sure. The biggest exposures are particularly in aluminum and steel is the biggest. So, we've reflected an additional $3 million to $5 million in the second half in terms of commodity pressure that we're seeing right now and that's included within our revised outlook.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your question, please.","Steven Hempel - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Hi, team. This is actually Steven Hempel on for Brian Johnson. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to drill down a little bit on the WLTP impact in 3Q and potentially 4Q. Could you just outline your kind of key exposures by OEMs, platforms, and maybe some of the key products?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Sure. Certainly from our perspective, the challenge of hitting the September 1 deadline for the different OEMs is going to be unique for each one of them. So, on the call today, I won't be able to go through every single elements of detail. But what I will say is that we are in very close communication with our customers and we do have regular updates in terms of production schedules.","So, based on our current plans and some shifts in production that we're seeing primarily in Q3, we believe that's having a negative impact on revenues in our second half of between $10 million and $15 million for the full year, all in H2 right now.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. And I would add maybe just to complement that if I look at the OEM groupings, I would say that the German OEMs appear to be having more difficulties or more timing issues related to getting through the WLTP than what we're seeing from our French and North American customers.","Steven Hempel - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And is that specific to kind of diesel or gasoline because my understanding was...","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","No. It's across the board.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. It's across all elements (37:12).","Steven Hempel - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then secondly, just in terms of the organic growth outlook for second half particularly for Powertrain Systems. As we think about, I believe, you call that a 200 basis point headwind to organic growth from light-duty declines in 2Q. Just wondering what the outlook is for the second half or what the assumption is for second half 2018.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","It's pretty similar to that. It's not fundamentally changing. It's slightly higher particularly in Europe, but we do have the offsets in India and other Asian markets at this level. So, we talked about 200 basis points for the year. We were approximately on that number for the first half, and it's relatively similar, if not slightly deteriorated, in the second half.","Steven Hempel - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just one quick last one on the GDi, the China headwinds here, is that primarily due to just lower production, production delays? Are there any cancellations that are kind of occurring? And then I guess just to follow on with that, from a longer-term strategic part of it, just in terms of your thinking, in terms of above market growth, how you guys think about discounting kind of new business wins.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah, so, I would say first of all, GDi, none of it is related to program cancellation. It's all to do with builds, with the Chinese OEMs and phasing of new program launches. In terms of discounting of volumes, so, again, we've been very, very disciplined in terms of how we discount volumes on new business bookings. And those discounts range from 10% with OEMs who we know historically meet their volumes, so the large Western OEMs for example, up to in the region of 70% with some of the local Chinese OEMs where we know that their stated volumes tend to be significantly different.","So, we take that into account very, very carefully when we're pursuing this new business and when we're recording it (39:03). And that's usually a mixture of historical view on OEM volume achievement, OEM penetration, IHS schedules and discussions around the quoting process. So, it varies by product and by customer but we have a very disciplined approach to make sure that we are accurate in terms of our bookings.","Steven Hempel - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from Guggenheim. Your question, please.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, everybody.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Hi, Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","My first question is on the product mix. You've mentioned multiple times in the call of sort of product mix is sort of like a headwind to margins. I assume that it sort of refers to obviously light vehicle diesel being very profitable but revenues down while a lot of your high growth areas are still not sort of like at these levels of profitability. Is my understanding correct? But also on the go-forward basis, is this more of a headwind than you had anticipated because I assume this is going to be a multi-year process, right, with light vehicle diesel basically going away and then some of these newer technologies not really ramping up to that level of profitability before several years. So, how do you think of your framework and are those pressures more than you had anticipated?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","I think, Emmanuel, you've summarized it well. I think the way that we look at the margin progression of the company, certainly in the margin, the negative mix does certainly refer to the growth that we're going to see this year in power electronics particularly and GDi, which is certainly offset by high margin programs, such as the light-duty diesel decline. That's certainly the case.","I think if you think about longer term, your comment is an accurate one in the sense that, at the moment, we are ramping up GDi capacity and we are incurring additional launch costs in terms of the new programs that we're undertaking at this stage and that certainly is having some negative short-term impacts that we believe will continue probably into 2019 on our incremental margins. So, our plan right now is to return to the numbers that I previously quoted of GDi incremental margins closer to the 15% to 20% range. But we do think it'll take a longer period of time to get there than we did previously.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And in terms of the impact from that on the overall company margin expansion framework, 40 to 50 basis points of annual margin expansion, is that still doable, I guess, with the mix headwind or has the mix headwind become more than you had anticipated at that time?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Well, I think at the moment, as Liam referred to and as I referred to as well, I think the bigger issues that are going on at the moment are around the macro trends and the evolution of our business. I think with everything that's going on, we talked at length that in the second half of the year, we incorporated almost $5 million of incremental tariffs hitting the numbers, low-single digit of additional cost hitting us in terms of the commodities and WLTP coming in at $10 million to $15 million on revenue.","What we have seen as a business is some very good cost control and a focus on making sure that margin expansion and on cash flow generation continues to be very strong. So, I think while the macroeconomics continue, we will see additional pressure on mix. There is (42:40). But I do believe at this point in time that we will end up looking at our cost base actively.","I will also just say that again, I refer back that the long-term growth, our strategic intent is to return margin expansion. And I believe we're on track for that.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. And, Emmanuel, maybe I can just add at a higher level. If I looked and we've always said this during the prior calls and the various discussions that we've been having, is if I look at this business in 2014, where the business was heavily weighted and exposed to the light-duty diesel market versus where I'm taking this business in 2020 and beyond, which is a much more balanced business around electrification, gasoline fuel systems, commercial vehicle and Aftermarket, there's a transition period that needs to take place.","And if you look at our bookings in 2014, where they were around $4 billion, that clearly reflects that revised commercial and portfolio strategy where that transition really is taking place in 2018 and 2019 as our portfolio rotates from one technology or one part of the business to another. So, we're going through that transition period now. And our bookings, as we've shown in 2017 and year-to-date 2018, are fully reflecting where the business will be in 2020 and beyond.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then just two follow-ups on previous comments you made, one on China and then one on GDi. So I guess starting with GDi, I'm surprised that sort of a weakness in China would sort of result in your overall global GDi revenues being down so much. Can you maybe give us some sense of within your GDi revenues, what sort of like geographic mix you have? Is North America important (44:27) as well?","And then, just looking for additional clarity also on the China factors (44:33), it seems like there's a bit of a potential softening in terms of the market in China now. What are you sort of anticipating sort of like for the balance of the year just in term \u2013 not specifically the mix issue that you have but in general, what kind of headwinds would that be for the balance of the year?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yes. So, on overall \u2013 so GDi, we've not disclosed what our GDi revenues are by region, but the majority of the softness on GDi is really around phasing of some of the new programs that are launching in Q3 and Q4 and also exposure to some of the local OEMs. So, it's a mix of the two really, as we've seen that. And also a very difficult, as you said, year-on-year comp where the business grew at 50% in Q2 2017.","In terms of our outlook for the rest of the year for China, it remains pretty much in line with what we saw in Q1. We don't see any softening at this point globally speaking, but we do see, as we said, softness for the local OEMs who cut their build schedules in Q2 and clearly some of them have lost share throughout the second quarter.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","And I did mention, Emmanuel, that in relation to GDi, commercial vehicle and power electronics, our assumptions for the full year are relatively unchanged. We will see an acceleration of GDi growth in the second half of 2018.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Your question, please.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just remind us of your commercial vehicle exposure and any color generally on the margin? Because you highlighted its negative mix but I always thought commercial vehicle, which seemed to have a pretty good quarter, tends to be higher margin than the rest, or is that just not accurate?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","No, that is accurate. If you look at our business today, really, the three elements of the mix that we talk about right now is fundamentally about the power electronics and the GDi, where we're ramping up the acceleration that we have as we launch \u2013 our launch profile. They certainly have some headwinds for us in terms of margin. Commercial vehicle itself is a good margin driver for us. But it's really sort of light-duty diesel that as that comes off, that is creating some headwinds as well. And, of course, the other element is really around the cost base, where we've incorporated additional commodity, as well as some of the tariff noise coming along as well, that's certainly impacted it. But commercial vehicle itself is not a drag (47:22).","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. Our CV business is around 20% of our overall revenues for the company. And as we've said previously, the margins for that business tend to be pretty much in line with the average for the business.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then North America, in particular, has been extremely strong. How much is North America commercial vehicles, is that majority? Because a lot of people are worried about whether those volumes are sustainable.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","So, North American commercial vehicle is \u2013 we don't disclose that actual number. But it's not a huge amount of our overall CV revenues. It's probably in the region of 5% to 10%. But clearly, our customer exposure is primarily with Volvo and DAF PACCAR and Daimler, who were building engine in Europe and exporting to North America.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. So, if you think about our sort of commercial revenue mix, it's around about 20% in North America. The majority is really in Europe, where we have 50% to 60% of our commercial vehicle share right now.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And how should we think about Aftermarket? It was down \u2013 I mean, how should we think about that trending just for the rest of the year and the outlook beyond that?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","So, the Aftermarket, the revenue was in line with our expectations. We did say that the focus of 2018 primarily was going to be about making sure that we focus on higher revenue \u2013 sort of margin revenue. And so, certainly, first half is in line. The second half, we will see some acceleration in our revenue growth. It's a positive territory, but we're still expecting for this year, Aftermarket revenues to be low-single-digit growth.","The trajectory beyond that, of course, is that we will review the Aftermarket this year. We're very pleased with the margin progression that's coming through and the cash generation the company is delivering right now and, of course, as part of the 2019 planning cycle we'd evaluate their revenue trends into next year.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just lastly any color on the tariff risk outside of China? Obviously, there is risk of other parts getting (49:44) tariffs. I mean, how much of your U.S. exposure is imports from other regions, or is it mostly oil play (49:51)?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","So obviously, there's a lot of noise, and it is difficult to predict how all of this will play out. But if you think about it, we don't identify exact China versus Europe or a breakdown by regions. But in total, we've incorporated about a $5 million impact in the second half of this year which is incorporated into our outlook. We are evaluating 2019, but we do believe that it will be bigger.","I think obviously with the new List 3 that's just been issued, potentially these new 6,000 lines that has been talked about being implemented by the end of the year, that would certainly add further pressure in terms of what the impact could be and that could be an additional $5 million to $7 million worth of impacts in 2019.","But I think what we are doing because we're not standing still on this one, we are actually looking and identifying how we can potentially localize some of our sourcing decisions which is very consistent with our previous manufacturing strategy. And obviously the impacts, really I'm talking about are direct impacts, but we're going to stay very close to our OEMs because how they respond to the tariffs would be very important for us as well.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Can you provide us with a breakdown of the $2.3 billion? How that's split between your key products with power electronics, GDi and then commercial vehicle?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yes. Sure. So, as you know, we don't provide a lot of detail below the $2.3 billion of bookings. But what I can do is say, in the quarter, our electronics and electrification business was around 40% of that $2.3 billion, gasoline fuel systems was again around 40% and the balance being in commercial vehicle. So, again a reflection just of the commercial strategy and the pursuit is really to make sure that we maintain balance and we're not over-indexing one part of the business to put unnecessary risk in the future.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then in electronics, what does that consist of outside of power electronics?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Engine and transmission controllers.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then maybe on that, the call you had on software, can you maybe talk about some of the competition you're seeing on the software side and where your competitive advantages are?","Mary Gustanski - Delphi Technologies Plc","So, this is Mary Gustanski. What we would see is our traditional engine management system competitors at the quoting table because if you can remember what we said, the OEMs are looking for those people that have had the traditional engine management system and now apply that to both hybrid systems and electrification. So, not a lot of new players in that software space nor standalone software being offered. It really is part of the entire system package.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And where are your advantages relative to the rest of the group?","Mary Gustanski - Delphi Technologies Plc","So, our advantage is what we bring is we're system integrators. So, if you recall what we talked about in our first teach-in on power electronics, our ability to mix and match our foundational portfolio, our technology packages in a way that makes it effective, cost effective, as well as meets the requirements of the OEM. Yet, it achieves the performance objectives that they're asking for and then being able to provide that software that provides yet another step function in performance over what the hardware can offer. In other words, giving them the best value solution to meet their challenges of the future.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Again, I guess, just what are the other people do, or your competitors do...?","Mary Gustanski - Delphi Technologies Plc","So, I think maybe let me say what we do and then you can relate it to some of the competition. Having 35 years of engine management experience has allowed us to put the software algorithms, as well as that knowledge of how to put our portfolio together allows us to have that foundational experience. So, 25 years of experience in electrification, it allows us to package the automotive grade and do that in a fashion to get more and more performance out of smaller packages. So, that historical performance and having things on the shelf, being able to get to market quicker makes us \u2013 a distinct difference in what Delphi Technologies can bring to the party.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah, so, just maybe I'll add a little bit of color to what Mary said. So, we're competing with the same guys in power electronics that we've been competing with for many, many years in our core Powertrain business, our historical Powertrain business, should I say.","And the key area of differentiation \u2013 and I've been engaged personally with a number of OEMs on pursuits that we're working at the moment \u2013 is really around the software capabilities that we have and the ability to package and integrate our inverter into their overall system. And clearly one of the advantages that we have with our inverter is the Viper technology that we went through at the last teach-in, which enables us to package it small and in more compact space and provide them a much more efficient solution.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your question, please.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, power electronics, now greater than $5 billion in lifetime bookings, expectation for 50% revenue growth. Can you maybe give us some color on how that breaks out both in the bookings and the revs between 48-volt and higher voltage applications? And then maybe just considering there's been so much focus on China on this call and the fact that China is clearly well ahead of other regions on EV penetration, can you talk about your China exposure in that part of the business and how that might break out between the domestic versus global? Thanks.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. Sure. So, just in terms of the mix between 48-volt and power electronics, so the majority of it, I would say, 85% to 90% of our power electronics bookings and growth is in higher voltage solutions. And we see from a 48-volt standpoint, especially in China, much less activity because the OEMs are moving towards higher voltage solutions to meet the NEV requirements that are out there.","And the same in Europe, we see more of a 48-volt, more of a transitionary technology, whilst the OEMs implement the higher voltage hybrid, plug-in hybrid and full BEV solutions. Then in terms of the mix between local and global OEMs, as I said earlier on the call, we maintain a very disciplined commercial strategy. And clearly, there is a tremendous amount of opportunity and activity out there in the market, specifically with the Chinese OEMs. We are extremely selective in terms of who we work with and who we develop our technology with and therefore \u2013 and clearly, when we do book business in China, we take appropriate discounts on the revenue associated with it.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. And if I could squeeze one more in. You mentioned earlier discussion around emissions drivers. I'm just curious. Can you give us any color on some of the early response or discussions you've had with your customers around the proposed CAFE rollback in the U.S.? If at all, how has that affect mix and plans (57:48)?","Mary Gustanski - Delphi Technologies Plc","Sure, Noah. So, no debate that we're going to see some relaxation in the U.S., but no matter what happens there, Europe and China are not slowing down. And in fact, if anything in their future outlook, they're accelerating the reductions in emissions. And because of that, the OEMs are looking at adding more and more electrification solutions to their line-up to be able to meet that. Also, they're saying even in the U.S. where they may not need it to meet the regulatory, they're going to be focusing those solutions to add more power for the feature and functionality for connected and automated functionality that certainly that technology is leading in the penetration here in the U.S.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","That's extremely helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Liam Butterworth for any further remarks.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Okay. Well, thank you for joining us on today's call. And clearly, we look forward to update you on progress at our next earning call for Q3. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."],"7274":["Delphi Technologies Plc (NYSE:DLPH) Q3 2018 Earnings Call November  7, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Sherief Hassan Bakr - Delphi Technologies Plc","Hari N.

Following the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being accorded and simultaneously webcast.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sherief Bakr, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sherief, please go ahead.","Sherief Hassan Bakr - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thank you, Kristi, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to Delphi Technologies third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today in London is our Interim Chief Executive Officer, Hari Nair; our Chief Financial Officer, Vivid Sehgal; as well as our Chief Technology Officer, Mary Gustanski.","This call include a discussion of our third quarter financial results as disclosed in today's press release, our outlook for 2018, as well as a preliminary outlook for 2019. In order to follow along with today's presentation, you can find an accompanying set of slides on our Investor Relations website at ir.delphi.com.","Please note that our discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to their corresponding GAAP measures in the tables within our press release.","Now, before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements.

I would encourage all of you to review these risk factors listed in these documents.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Hari Nair.","Hari N. Nair - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thank you, Sherief. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call. Before commenting on our Q3 performance, I wanted to briefly share some initial high-level observations since my appointment as Interim CEO.","Delphi Technologies is a great long-term growth opportunity and I see exceptional prospects to continue to grow this business as we strengthen our leadership position in our key technologies. We have strong growth drivers, driven by regulatory and consumer demand and an industry-leading portfolio of products and services for both our OEM and Aftermarket customers. However, we need to sharpen our focus on operational excellence and prioritize our investments in key technologies to drive long-term profitable growth.","I'm proud of the response of the Delphi Technologies team since I joined, the relentless focus we have on serving our customers and delivering long-term value to our shareholders. My immediate priorities have been focused on two main areas: ensuring Delphi Technologies is well positioned to manage the shorter-term headwinds impacting our industry; and accelerating the initiatives we have in place to improve our longer-term profitability and cash flow.","Vivid will talk in more detail about our Q3 performance and our preliminary view on 2019. But slide 2 gives you some key highlights of the third quarter. Continuing the trend we saw in the first half of the year, our bookings performance was a highlight of the quarter and gives us confidence in our future. $3.8 billion of bookings in Q3 reflects the strong demand we continue to see in key areas of our portfolio, such as Power Electronics, GDi, and Commercial Vehicle Systems.","I'll come back to our bookings momentum and the investments we are making to drive long term profitable growth in a few moments. Revenue of $1.2 billion in the quarter was down by slightly less than 1% year-on-year and below our expectations coming into the quarter. Overall production growth was approximately 500 basis points lower than anticipated in third quarter, as growth in all regions and especially China moderated significantly.","Offsetting this was another quarter of strong growth in key areas of the portfolio. Power Electronics which grew by approximately 35% and Commercial Vehicle Systems which grew by approximately 20%. Our revenues in China declined by 12% in the third quarter primarily due to lower GDi revenues to local OEM customers as well as the overall market decline.","Adjusted operating income of $108 million or a 9.3% margin was impacted by the weaker revenue growth as well as the ongoing transitions in our portfolio. For example, from higher margin light-duty diesel revenues towards more advanced but currently lower margin Power Electronics and GDi. This was partially offset by another quarter of planned year-on-year margin improvement in our Aftermarket business.","Operationally, we are on track to come off the transition service agreements with Aptiv in a timely and cost effective manner. However, we need to enhance our focus on our own operational excellence. And finally, we generated $54 million of operating cash flow in Q3, impacted by both lower earnings as well as unfavorable working capital dynamics.","Now, turning to slide 3. We continue to operate in a dynamic environment where we are seeing stronger regulatory-driven and consumer demand for more efficient propulsion solutions for both passenger cars and commercial vehicles. These secular growth trends have accelerated over the last year, resulting in higher than expected demand for our GDi and Power Electronics offerings. And we are continuing to invest significantly in both engineering and manufacturing capacity to support our customers growing needs.","At the same time, as you can see at the bottom of slide 3, we have seen a more challenging macro and industry backdrop over the course of 2018, which has also added some uncertainty as we look ahead into next year. In terms of global production, we see a deterioration in growth in Q3 and we expect continued weakness in Q4, primarily related to market dynamics in China.","Looking ahead into 2019, we now assume global production to be approximately flat year-on-year. In Europe, we have the impact from WLTP, as well as the accelerated transition from diesel to GDi and electrified powertrains. And finally, we have changes in the global trade and tariff framework, which we have incorporated into our outlook.","One of the strengths of our business continues to be that we have balance in our portfolio, driven by our regional and customer mix, a highly localized footprint, and our Aftermarket business. This balance mitigates our exposure to any one single market driver. Building on our strong momentum in the marketplace over the past couple of years, our bookings performance in Q3 was again a highlight and reflects our customers continued recognition of the technologies and value we provide.","While the nature of quarterly bookings are typically uneven, $3.8 billion of lifetime revenue booked in Q3 was an outstanding result. And on a year-to-date basis, $9 billion of bookings is well ahead of the $7.1 billion achieved in the whole of 2017, which in itself was a record for Delphi Technologies.","Our win rates from both conquest and incumbent business continue to be higher year-on-year, which is a reflection of the value our customers place on our portfolio of differentiated technologies as well as our disciplined commercial strategy. As you know, we have been focused on having a balance in our go-to-market strategy across portfolio, customers, and regions.","Q3 saw a continuation of this trend with major wins in both our internal combustion engine and electrification technologies, balanced across our three major regions. Let's look at some of our key wins in this quarter.","For the internal combustion engine technologies segment, which made up approximately 60% of our Q3 bookings, there were a number of truly outstanding wins. We booked one of our largest ever GDi programs with a major European OEM for our industry-leading 350 bar system. In addition, we secured our largest GDi booking to-date in North America with a major OEM.","From an electronics and electrification perspective, our differentiated technologies, including systems and software expertise, continue to help us win in the marketplace. In Q3, we secured multiple Power Electronics bookings for our combined inverter and DC to DC converter. On a year-to-date basis, we have secured almost $2.5 billion of Power Electronics bookings and we continue to see significant opportunities in the global marketplace. The investments we are making are consistent with our accelerated bookings momentum, ensuring they are fully aligned with the most attractive long-term growth and incremental content opportunities ahead of us.","Turning to slide 5. As Vivid will discuss, we remain highly confident in our ability to deliver a significant acceleration in our growth as we look out beyond 2019, particularly as we start to convert our bookings momentum over the last couple of years to revenue momentum, and as the revenue headwinds from light-duty diesel start to dissipate.","From an investment perspective, we will continue to prioritize on three key long-term growth technologies: Power Electronics, GDi, and Commercial Vehicle Systems. And despite the shorter term softness in our growth, our strategic priority remains on investing to ensure we execute on our bookings momentum and capture the long-term growth ahead of us. While these incremental investments are expected to weigh on our 2019 financial performance, we believe this is the right approach to drive the acceleration in growth, deliver margin expansion, and generate the strong free cash flow that we see over the longer term.","Before I turn the call over to Vivid, I wanted to reiterate my focus on improving our execution as we navigate through a softer and a more uncertain market environment, which we see moderating as we look through to 2020. And as I mentioned at the start of my remarks, I am very excited about our technology-driven growth opportunities and ensuring we execute with discipline to deliver long-term value creation to our shareholders.","Vivid?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thank you, Hari. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. My remarks will focus on three key areas: our Q3 performance and outlook for 2018, a preliminary view of 2019, and the drivers behind the inflection point we see in growth, margin and cash flow beyond next year.","Starting with a high-level recap of our Q3 financials, which you can see on slide 7. Before I get into the discussion of our year-on-year performance in Q3 and similar to the last few earnings calls, you will see that we have presented the prior year's results on both a pro forma and reported basis. The difference, $20 million of revenue and $14 million of operating income, reflects the pro forma adjustments and gives you the right starting point to compare our year-on-year growth in Q3.","Revenue of $1.2 billion in the quarter declined by slightly less than a 1% year-on-year versus an overall market decline of approximately 2%. Driving the revenue performance in the quarter was strong growth in Power Electronics and Commercial Vehicle which was offset by lower sales in China and, to a lesser extent, by impacts related to passenger car diesel and WLTP in Europe.","Adjusted operating income of $108 million or 9.3% margin declined by 190 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to the impact of unfavorable mix as well as incremental engineering spend. In addition, operating income was impacted by FX headwinds and high commodity and tariff-related costs. This was partially offset by cost control initiatives including lower-than-planned spin-related costs.","Operating cash flow of $54 million was impacted by both lower earnings, as well as working capital outflows given some of the customer (14:37) dynamics particularly in China. Our operating cash flow performance remains a key area of focus for us and we expect to see an improvement in operating cash flow in Q4.","Turning to slide 8, which provides more detail on our revenue progression in the quarter. Looking at our Q3 revenue growth in more detail, as Hari mentioned, we continue to see strong growth in two key areas of the portfolio. Power Electronics revenues increased by approximately 35% in Q3 versus prior year, and Commercial Vehicle revenues increased by approximately 20%.","GDi revenues declined by approximately 15% in the quarter, primarily related to lower revenue in China, the impact of WLTP and a higher year-on-year comparison from the prior quarter when GDi revenues grew by approximately 60%. We expect to see an improved revenue performance from the GDi business in the fourth quarter, supported by a significant program launch with a leading global OEM.","From a regional perspective, we outgrew the market in all regions with the exception of China. Revenue in Europe increased by 5%, as growth in Commercial Vehicle and GDi was offset by the ongoing decline in passenger car diesel revenues. North America revenue growth of 3% was primarily driven by new program launches as well as high sales to Commercial Vehicle customers. Finally our sales in China declined by 12%, driven by the combination of market softness as well as our own customer mix.","As I commented last quarter, our current revenue mix in China is split fairly evenly between global and local OEM customers. Within the local OEM customer mix, our revenues are heavily weighted towards the smaller OEMs, many of whom have seen significant and accelerated reductions in their market share over the last couple of quarters.","Just to put some numbers around this. We saw our local customers reduce their vehicle productions by approximately 10% in the first half of the year. This decline accelerated in the third quarter to almost 30% and we expect similar declines in Q4. Offsetting this, we have new program launches in China in the fourth quarter and on an overall basis, we expect our China revenues to be down approximately 20% in Q4.","Slide 9 walks through our operating income growth for Q3. Adjusted operating income was $108 million, down from $133 million in the prior-year quarter. This was primarily driven by unfavorable mix, foreign exchange headwinds, and to a lesser extent higher commodity and tariff-related costs. In addition, we continue to invest to support our stronger than expected bookings momentum, with engineering spend as a percentage of sales up by approximately 40 basis points year-on-year.","Turning to our segment performance on the next slide. On a year-on-year basis, Powertrain Systems adjusted revenue declined by 1.9% in the quarter as strong growth in Power Electronics and Commercial Vehicle was offset by lower revenues in passenger car diesel, the impact of WLTP and softness in GDi, as I mentioned before. Adjusted operating margin of 9% was down 220 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to the unfavorable mix and incremental engineering spend to support long-term growth. In addition, margin was impacted by higher commodity and tariff-related cost and FX headwinds, which were partially offset by ongoing improvements in operational performance.","Turning to our Aftermarket segment on slide 11. Our strategy to expand the margin of our Aftermarket segment remains on track. In line with this, we have focused on increasing our growth in the independent Aftermarket channel as well as prioritizing higher margin products. I am pleased with the progress we have made in 2018. Revenue of $217 million declined by less than 1% as higher sales to independent Aftermarket customers was more than offset by lower sales through the OES channel. Adjusted operating margin expanded by 70 basis points year-on-year, primarily by our commercial strategy and operational performance. In addition, the Aftermarket segment has continued to deliver improved operating cash flow through the combination of higher earnings and a focus on improving working capital. For 2018, we are confident on delivering full year margin improvements compared to 2017.","Now, let's move forward to our full year outlook for 2018. Slide 12 outlines our outlook for the year. At a high level, this outlook is consistent with the update we provided at the start of October with additional relevant metrics. Starting with revenue. For the full year, we expect revenue to be between $4.85 billion and $4.9 billion or a zero to 0.5% adjusted growth compared to 2017. For the fourth quarter, we currently expect vehicle production to be down by approximately 15, primarily driven by weakness in China where we expect production to be down by a high-single-digit percent in Q4.","We continue to expect strong growth in 2018 in Power Electronics and Commercial Vehicle Systems. For Power Electronics, we expect revenue growth to be approximately 50% in 2018. Full year adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the 11.3% and 11.5% range and for adjusted EPS our outlook calls for earnings per share in the range of $4.20 to $4.30. And operating cash flow is expected to be in the range of $370 million to $400 million for the year.","Turning to slide 13, which provides a preliminary high-level view on our 2019 expectations and some of the key drivers. We plan to provide more specific details on our Q4 earnings call in February. Directionally, we have assumed that the trends impacting our second half 2018 financials will continue through 2019. More specifically, certain transitional headwinds such as passenger car diesel and our customer mix in China are expected to further weigh on our financial performance next year.","Starting with revenue where we expect adjusted revenue growth to be approximately 1% to 2%, this assumes global production to be approximately flat. In terms of our own revenue dynamics, there are three key trends that I have previously spoken about which we expect to accelerate in 2019.","First, on China, where we expect to see the impact of continued share loss of our local OEM customers in a weaker market environment. Second, passenger car diesel, this revenue headwind primarily in Europe is expected to have close to a 300-basis point impact on top line growth in 2019 versus an expected 200-basis point impact in 2018. And third, key technologies, our expectations of a stronger growth in Power Electronics and GDi in 2019 driven by program launches in Europe and China.","I plan to provide more details on our Q4 earnings call. But from a medium-term perspective, we expect the transitional impact of the first two dynamics to moderate as we head into 2020 and beyond with the more structural tailwinds of key growth technologies having a more significant impact on our overall revenue trajectory.","Turning to profitability, our preliminary outlook is for adjusted operating margin to be approximately 9% to 10%. In the middle of slide 13 outlines a number of the drivers behind this range. Looking at some of the most impactful. First, from a mix perspective, we see an acceleration of the decline of higher than average margin passenger car diesel revenues in 2019 with an acceleration of growth in Power Electronics and GDi, both of which are yet to reach breakeven profitability. Second, the absence of foreign exchange tailwinds benefiting first half of 2018 results which equates to approximately 50 basis points of margin on a full year basis. Third, given the better than expected bookings momentum we have seen over the last several quarters as well as the pursuits we are actively engaged in, we plan to increase our engineering spend in 2019 with key technologies to drive the acceleration of growth that we see ahead of us.","For both Power Electronics and GDi, these incremental investments will allow us to further scale our operations in order to drive incremental revenue and accelerate margin expansion. We remain laser-focused on cost control, especially in a lower growth environment, and our priority remains on finding sources of savings to fund these investments. For example, by reallocating our engineering CapEx investments for more mature technologies and continuing to establish lower cost stand-alone functions as we exit our transition service agreements.","We also target further margin expansion in our Aftermarket segment in 2019 as part of our ongoing focus on more profitable channels and products. In addition to increasing our engineering spend for future growth, we also expect to increase CapEx in 2019. And due to stronger near-term demand in GDi and Power Electronics, we believe that increasing our CapEx to around 7% of sales in 2019 is a more appropriate level to meet this demand and ultimately drive incremental long-term growth.","Finally on cash flow, while we expect to have lower year-on-year one-time separation cost in 2019, our preliminary view is for free cash flow to be around breakeven, given the incremental growth in CapEx as well as reviewing the future pension provision to our UK workforce. On a longer term basis, we remain confident in the free cash flow generation capabilities of our business, especially as earnings growth accelerates and we return to more normalized levels of CapEx and restructuring.","Turning to slide 14. As I mentioned on the previous slide, we have assumed that the trends impacting our second half 2018 financials will continue through 2019. On slide 14, you can see how this is reflected in our adjusted operating margin outlook. Starting on the left, there is the 12.5% of adjusted operating margin we delivered in the first half of 2018. Moving to the dotted areas in the middle, you can see our implied margin outlook range for the second half of 2018 which is between 10.3% and 10.5%. Considering market dynamics, mix and foreign exchange rates, we believe that this is a better starting point from which to assess our 2019 margin profile.","While we are still in the process of refining our 2019 outlook, the right hand side of the slide lays out the dynamics that we expect to impact our margin performance relative to the second half of 2018. The approximately 9% to 10% margin in 2019 assumes that there are incremental headwinds primarily related to the unfavorable mix and higher engineering spend I referenced earlier, as well as the higher depreciation, given the elevated CapEx this year.","Looking beyond 2019, slide 15 provides our preliminary longer-term outlook. As I mentioned at the start of my remarks, we see an inflection point in our financials as we move through 2019. We plan to provide further details on our Q4 call. But there are four key drivers behind the acceleration we see in 2020 and beyond.","First, our strong bookings momentum in key technologies starts to translate into stronger revenue growth. Second, a moderation of the transitional headwinds from passenger car diesel and a more balanced global OEM customer mix in China. Third, we realize operating leverage as Power Electronics and GDi ramp to scale. And fourth, we normalized our levels of CapEx and restructuring.","At a high level, we expect this to result in an acceleration in our adjusted revenue growth to mid- to high-single digit levels, operating margin expansion coupled with significantly improved cash flow. So in closing and before we take your questions, while we are operating in a dynamic and more challenging environment, our priority remains on the long-term value creation opportunity ahead of us. In the shorter term, my focus will remain on cost control and operating cash generation while continuing to invest to support our tremendous bookings momentum and market opportunity.","With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess the first one I have is I just want to, I guess, better understand some of the definitional stuff you're showing here. Because at the end of 2017, it says the lifetime bookings was $7.1 billion. You recorded year-to-date about $3.7 billion in revenue.","And then for tracking it, I think you reported about $9 billion of wins this year, which would suggest the lifetime value should be closer to $12 billion. So, have you sort of taken down some of the volume assumptions for some of those prior wins? Or is something wrong with my math there?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","It's Vivid here. The bookings themselves are basically not \u2013 I mean these are bookings that range anywhere from two years right through till seven years in terms of lifetime bookings. So, a GDi bookings momentum that we take this year, the revenue starts really generating in a couple of years time. Whereas more a commercial vehicle-type of booking may take slightly longer to do that.","So, our bookings are definitely in terms of customer wins, both on a conquest and an incumbent basis. But no, the bookings momentum that we have this year, we intend to see those being translated into revenue in the sort of 2020 timeframe and beyond. So no, I don't think your math is in any way suspect on that.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So \u2013 but just to be clear, I mean the $9 billion of lifetime, I mean that encapsulates everything, regardless of whether it's GDi or Commercial Vehicle...","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Correct.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","...anything you think you're going to recognize over the coming years. So, it does seem like you've taken a big whack to some of the prior volume associated with the programs you previously won. Is that fair?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","No. No. I think if you look at our bookings right now, I mean in terms of prior bookings that we took, a lot of the booking revenues that we have at this stage were booking wins that were taken at least three to four years ago that are translating into revenues now on average. So the momentum that you're going to see and what gives us confidence going forward in terms of the bookings momentum, the $7 billion of bookings in 2017 and the $9 billion of bookings year-to-date in this period. And if you look at the momentum and what gives us real comfort right now in Q3 is that these bookings are actually in advanced technologies.","So in Q3 for example, 60% of the bookings are in the GDi advanced gasoline systems whereas in the Power Electronics it's 40%, and for year-to-date it's about 50\/50 in terms of split. So this is giving us the confidence as we go forward that the revenue inflections that we're seeing in 2020 and 2021 will come through because that booking momentum is growing. And we take the necessary haircuts and risks in terms of our bookings momentum to ensure that they reflect our capacity as well as bringing it down in terms of some of the macroeconomics that we're seeing right now. So we intend to see these bookings momentum in the future, and we're confident they're going to come through.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then maybe for Hari, you might be coming from the board uniquely qualified to answer this, but if we go back in time, there were reports back when Delphi were still part of Delphi Automotive that some combination of this business might make sense with some other players. Given your view of where the business is right now, does it make sense to entertain strategic alternatives?","Hari N. Nair - Delphi Technologies Plc","Well, it's a good question, but I mean clearly I can't speculate on any M&A type opportunities. Our focus really as we've just gone through, Vivid and I, is to drive our technology-driven growth, invest in all these new exciting products that we have, support the new book of business, and really drive on through the industry transitional headwinds that we're facing right now. So that's what we're focused on.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Yeah. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe the first one as I was looking at the free cash flow slide I thought it was interesting you called out the UK pension review. I mean, how much could that be from a potential drag for next year's free cash flow and what exactly does that entail?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Sure. I mean, obviously, we recognize the scale of the current pension deficit that we have in terms of our balance sheet as we go forward. And it's always been our aim to try and mitigate this increasing risk going forward. So we're doing that right now and I think it's very appropriate that we do tackle this issue. We are in consultation right now. And until this is complete, I'm not going to be able to provide full details, which I will be able to provide much more clarity in Q4.","However, what I will say is that our free cash flow preliminary guidance that we have given does contemplate incremental contributions in 2019, and they are actually captured within that. So I cannot provide further color at this stage because of the consultation that is going on. I will provide 2019 further details on the Q4 call. But just to reiterate, we have contemplated pension contributions in our 2019 free cash flow preliminary estimates.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And you can't tell us today what that underfunded level is?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","I can tell you what the underfunded level is because that is actually in our 10-Q and 10-K. Yes. I mean the underfunded is around about $400 million to $500 million in relation to the pension deficit. That does not indicate anywhere near the level of cash flow that is required in terms of closing that gap, not by any means. That is the U.S. GAAP version of the pension deficit. Our requirement right now is to ensure that the cash contributions we put in there ensure that we close down the future accrual pension scheme in the UK. And our current free cash flow assumes that the cash contributions are covered within that for 2019.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. And another one for me. As I think about laying out the preliminary 2019 outlook, I think we all understand the headwinds that \u2013 or have an understanding of what some of the headwinds you're facing are. But then, you said 2020 beyond, looking at mid-single digit to high-single digit type of revenue growth with the inflection that you're seeing, what type of incremental margins do you think you should be achieving on that business after you get through, let's call it, 2019 and another transition year and go beyond 2020?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Sure. I mean certainly, in terms of the sort of revenue trajectory, you're right. I mean we are looking sort of in the medium term. We are confident, in relation to the first answer that I gave, that the lifetime bookings that we've booked in the past will certainly come through in terms of revenue pace in 2020. We also see, obviously, the impact of light duty diesel that we see as a sort of large element of the 2019 story dissipating. And some of the transitional headwinds that we see in China in terms of our revenue as well in terms of the local OEM customer mix also beginning to dissipate.","I think what we can see and, again, I will provide further details on margin expansion opportunities but we do see a return to margin growth in 2020 and I think that comes from a number of areas. I think that number one comes from Power Electronics and GDi are above growth rate expectations that we originally had and as we ramp to scale, we will get operating leverage opportunities there.","We are focusing additionally on the cost control of this business, and I think with Hari and myself, are looking very, very quickly at opportunities to ensure that we right-size this business even further given some of the softness we've seen. And of course, our other story right now is the Aftermarket continues to have a very strong margin trajectory which was always part of our plan.","So what we see right now is 2019 is definitely an inflection point for us with 2020 driving operating margin expansion and I will provide more details on that in the Q4 call.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Understood. Maybe my last one just following up there. As we think about GDi and Power Electronics getting to scale, what's the annual run rate of revenues today? What do you need to get to to be at breakeven and then beyond that if you can care to communicate any incremental margins on those two businesses as they get past that scale level?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Sure. I mean where we stand at the moment is that I think both in Power Electronics and GDi, we see a bright future. If you look at the momentum \u2013 I'll sort by revenue first. If you look at the level of bookings and the momentum that we have in terms of lifetime bookings, a large or almost all of the growth is in advanced technologies which include GDi and Power Electronics. So we do see definitely a confidence in terms of our revenue projections in relation to both GDi and Power Electronics going forward.","In terms of the margins, I've said previously before that we probably around about 12 to 18 months behind our original sort of spin announcement in terms of the margins on GDi, and that's largely driven by the excess volumes that have been driven through particularly in Europe at this stage. So, I would say right now without going into details that I will provide in Q4, we see a pathway back to sort of breakeven GDi margins probably in the 12 to 18-month timeframe is when we start getting back to more normalized breakeven levels compared to where we are today.","We've made great progress in the second half of 2018. And in the second half, we are significantly better in operating margins, in GDi particularly, than we were in the first half, and that gives us real confidence that we're able to drive that back in a 12 to 18-month period is when we believe that will start happening.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I just want to follow up on that and just try to get our heads around GDi versus diesel. My understanding when we talked in the spring is that the diesel injectors and the gas injectors are coming out of the same factories. The capital equipment is similar. So, what is driving the lower margin on GDi? Maybe if you could separate the incremental, decremental margins on gas versus diesel from the issues of overhead absorption and just pricing? I'm wondering with Bosch having outsized market share in diesel is there just a more favorable pricing level in diesel that you don't get on a more fragmented gas market?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Sure. Hey, Brian. Vivid here. So, look, we've always stated that GDi and Power Electronics operating income margins will be lower and will ramp up with scale. We've always sort of defined that, and that is exactly what is happening now. It just happens to be 12 to 18 months longer than we originally expected.","The key element is while we are in similar factories, the capital requirements of both are very different. GDi, with the volumes that we have and the launches we have, we are constantly putting new CapEx in. If you look at the incremental CapEx we're putting into the business right now, that is predominantly being driven by GDi launch wins that we've had this year and the previous year, and we intend to continue to put CapEx in.","So, in terms of what is driving this, we've always said that GDi margins will ramp to scale and that's what's going on. In terms of how that's working, this is obviously as we put CapEx in in relation to actually volumes, the levels of scrap, the level of efficiency that we get through the manufacturing process improves over time, and that's what's going on.","We also have levels of engineering that is higher right now than we have for diesel where obviously we haven't booked any further programs since 2014. So, from our perspective, on a GDi basis, it's that we are making the inroads. It's in line with what we said, but we're about 12 to 18 months behind schedule right now.","So, we understand that where we are with this right now when we're putting into place clear strategies and Hari's on board to support that as well in terms of where we think GDi will go, and I will provide more details on the GDi ramp in the Q4 call to provide more clarity over the longer term GDi trajectory.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Second question and then I have a third for Hari. When you look at your exposure to China with the smaller local OEMs who indeed lost share in this downturn, if there is meaningful stimulus and if it is focused on the sub 1.6 liter engine size and skewed in a way to reboot sales in lower tier cities, would this headwind turn into a tailwind or are there more structural issues with your customer base there in terms of their ability to hold market share in China?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","In terms of China, there's obviously two impacts that have impacted us in the second half of 2018. The first one is definitely just the weaker market that we've seen and we've called, for example, in Q4 to a high-single-digit decline in the market at the back end of this one. We currently do not assume any type of stimulus in our numbers, so if an economic stimulus was to occur and was to obviously be targeted towards the local OEs or those with the smaller engine sizes, that certainly would be good news for us. That would certainly be a tailwind for us, potentially, in 2019 because that's not currently assumed.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then a question for Hari. Good to be talking to you again. Can you describe a little bit what happened with the outgoing CEO \u2013 pushed, shoved, the opportunity he saw? Second, your biggest positive and your biggest negative surprise now that you're inside as opposed to sitting on the board?","And three, how the CEO search is going and whether you consider yourself in the running or you're really looking for someone else?","Hari N. Nair - Delphi Technologies Plc","So let me start with one. I guess I'd say easy to answer that one. I mean, just as it was announced the former CEO chose to resign and as you've probably tracked through the press, he's now in another position in the London area. So really that's all there is to say about that.","In terms of what I've found as I've come into this role at Delphi Technologies, I'll start with the first point that I originally saw when I joined the board a little over a year ago, which is a great portfolio of technologies and products that can really help drive this industry in all the growth segments that we're seeing going forward. So GDi and Power Electronics being the highlights and then Commercial Vehicle Systems where we have good positions, but I see great opportunities to grow there as well from where we are today.","So if you take that backdrop and you think about operating leverage opportunities as the top line grows, as Vivid has described in some detail, I see some tremendous opportunities in terms of operational excellence through our plants, our engineering, our launch activities towards driving margin improvement and certainly cash flow. So as I have gotten into some of the details here, I'm even more excited than when I was just aware of the product portfolio that I saw earlier.","In terms of the CEO search, all I can say is as soon as the change was announced, the board formed a search committee and a process is well underway. And as soon as a CEO is selected, there will be an announcement. And I'm sure the process is considering, yeah, all their options."," And are you on that subcommittee or you're just running...","Hari N. Nair - Delphi Technologies Plc","I'm not on that subcommittee. No.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Hari N. Nair - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Colin Langan with UBS. Your line is open.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. On the Investor Day before this, then I think the target was 14% by 2022. We're significantly off that now, I mean, is that structurally like possible at this point? I mean is it just delayed? How should we think about that or is it just there's a structural issue that we really can't get back there?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","I'm going to give medium term operating income guidance and clarity on the Q4 call. I think the way to think about it right now is the structure of the business as we look at it, the bookings momentum and the opportunities that we have in Power Electronics and GDi, in terms of the momentum that we've seen and the pursuits that we've won is far stronger than we expected back about a year ago. $9 billion of bookings this year driven in key technologies is a very different landscape to the one that we talked about at least a year ago.","And I think what's important to understand is that what we are doing as a company right now is actively investing behind that. And that active investment is including in terms of very, very controlled but effective engineering spend as well as the CapEx that we're putting behind it. So I think the company where we stand, what I think is exciting about this company is our growth opportunities in the advanced technologies is even stronger in terms of the bookings momentum than we had before. So I will be providing operating income clarity in terms of going forward, but I think that the stage that we're setting ourselves for the longer term is a different stage to the one we are a year ago. And I think the advanced technologies are ahead of where we expected them to be in terms of the bookings momentum.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","I mean do you think those Power Electronics and GDi, are they structurally going to be the same margins as the rest of the business? Or are they reasons why they might be lower going forward?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. So overall, I mean our trajectory that we said, we see no reasons why these advanced technologies return to company average margins, there's no reason at all. I think the challenge of any business that's growing at the pace in terms of the bookings momentum that we have on board right now, is making sure that we effectively have the right level of investments and engineering to support that. And making sure that we're putting enough CapEx behind it to make sure that we have the capacity and drive to achieve that.","So, I think no. I'd see no reasons why these cannot return to company average margins. But we are going to invest appropriate to make sure that the long-term growth trajectory in terms of revenue can be delivered.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just lastly, any sense on what percent of sales those two businesses are today? I mean is it something less than \u2013 I thought it was something around 15%. And then are they \u2013 any color on their overall profitability? I mean how big is the margin gap versus their average today?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","No. What we have said \u2013 so overall, I mean I think if you think about what we've said, is that we've talked about Power Electronics being a 50% revenue growth this year, with GDi in terms of some of the China issues, WLTP, going negative. But GDi today is about $0.5 billion business for us and growing at pace in the outer years, which I'll provide more color.","And Power Electronics is growing at pace and will excess $300 million. So, we are in a strong position on both of those opportunities right now. The key thing is the growth potential that we have and if I talk about it again, the bookings momentum of the $9 billion bookings that we booked this year, that is predominantly GDi and Power Electronics. And I think a lot of that will start translating into real revenue in the next couple of years.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Aileen Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys. This is Aileen Smith on for John. Thank you for all the commentary on the 2019 outlook. If we think about some of the market pressures in the third quarter where you guys landed at a low 9% operating margin, your implication for 4Q, and then the preliminary 2018 guide of 9% to 10%, how do we bridge on a sequential basis the implied step-up in margins in the fourth quarter and then a step significantly back down into next year? Is that just a function of seasonality or are there particular factors that you expect will be much bigger headwinds into next year than in 4Q and possibly comparable or even more pronounced than in the third quarter?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Hi, Aileen. It's Vivid here. So the Q4 numbers, we're confident of delivering the Q4. And so in terms of why the step-up versus Q3? There is a seasonality. Q4 is traditionally a stronger quarter in terms of the income that we deliver. Secondly and importantly is the level of engineering spend. If you look at our engineering, we did have high planned engineering spend in Q3 and the Q4 will be lower than that. That's very important for us. And I think the last point an important one is the WLTP was an impact predominantly in Q3 and which did have a margin as well as a revenue headwind for us and we see most of that issue dissipating with limited impacts in Q4 versus what we had in Q3. So, we are reiterating the guidance of 11.3% to 11.5% and that assumes an uptick in the Q4 in line with what I've said.","In terms of the 9% to 10%, if I look at that, this is obviously full year and I will provide more clarity. But mainly, there are a few impacts on that. The first one, really, is the mix of the business that we have assumed in the past as well. Light duty diesel, like I said, will have a stronger 300 basis point impact on the top line which, again, is about 75% program roll-off which we expect to see. That is obviously a slightly higher margin today.","We certainly don't expect to have the same level of FX tailwinds that we've had this year that I've called out. We also expect to spend more in terms of incremental engineering spend to support the bookings momentum that we have in place today. And we are going to have incremental commodity and tariffs exposure and I called that out at about $15 million incremental based on commodity and the Section 3 that we saw through the U.S. China. But on the other side, we are absolutely focused on cost savings at this stage and, again, Hari and I are focused clearly on that. And we're going to continue this sort of reallocation of the story in terms of cost base.","And lastly, of course, we do have Aftermarket that will and is on track to deliver the planned level of margin expansion that we put forward.","Aileen Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's very helpful. Thanks for the color. And second question, I appreciate this is somewhat fluid depending on market factors and how you guys can execute and adjust your cost structure. But is there a rough rule of thumb that you guys think about internally for required revenue growth in order to drive margin expansion? In the past, we've considered 5% revenue growth to be a key fulcrum point above which suppliers are able to drive margins.","So to the extent that your mid-term outlook for revenue growth appears to have improved from low-single-digits that you provided at your Investor Day last year to possibly mid to high-single-digits that you indicated in your slide deck today, should we also assume that this will drive significant margin expansion, excluding some of the significant headwinds like engineering and commodities that you noted?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","So we've never publicly disclosed a rule of thumb around 5%. But I think in general \u2013 so first of all, I think the booking momentums that we have certainly gives us confidence in terms of revenue growth 2020 and beyond. We certainly feel that's there. Also the absence of light-duty diesel is going to be important as that rolls off. That will be very important.","But I think your comment around margin expansion given the volume projections that we see in GDi and Power Electronics particularly, would imply operating leverage in relation to volume increases that will drive revenue and operating margin. So I think directionally, without going into numbers, I think what you're saying is correct. Yes.","Aileen Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And on the CapEx side of the equation, the 7% as a percent of sales in 2019 being the more appropriate level to support new business bookings into next year, should we still be looking at 5% to 6% as a percent of sales which you guys had indicated at your Investor Day a little over a year ago? Is that still the right way to think about CapEx over the longer term, and should we look at 2019 as \u2013 go ahead.","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","No. So I think, Aileen, the -- I will provide more clarity. First of all, let me say, in terms of the CapEx of 7%, I want to be very clear. That CapEx increment that we're seeing, I will provide more color. But that incremental is all driven by the key technologies and booking momentum. We are still on track in relation to the one-time separation cost that we put in place, and the additional capital expenditure is all behind our key technologies and the bookings momentum that is out there.","I think longer term, as I said before without going into numbers, we believe that part of the margin expansion and the cash flow return to more normalized level comes down to a more normalized level of CapEx. So, I think in terms of the way we're looking, we do believe that 2019 is relatively high to the normalized rates primarily because of the level of booking momentum that we have in place today.","Aileen Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And last just housekeeping item. You guys included commodities and tariffs together in your margin performance drivers in the slide deck. Is there any way to estimate or break out those two separately, meaning what's the impact of tariff on your cost structure versus just generally inflating commodity costs?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. That's fine. I mean, certainly from a high level I have \u2013 I briefly mentioned in the past the number that we're expecting to be for the tariff in relation to the S301 for China, for example, is in the range of about $8 million to $10 million for 2019, incremental on top of what we've booked this year. And the commodity range is in the $3 million to $5 million range, incremental to what we've booked this year.","Aileen Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's very helpful. Thank you for the questions.","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess my question is we've seen similar headwinds across the suppliers this quarter with relations to tariffs and China, etcetera. When I look at the decremental margins of the guidance that you put out there in early October, it implies 40%-plus decremental margins for suppliers where we tend to expect 20% to 25% decremental margins. And that raises questions on \u2013 given that we're seeing these headwinds for everyone, how much of this is macro versus operational, structural challenges that you may be working through? And I don't know if there's any color that you can provide there in reference to the decrementals?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Sure. I mean if I talk more around what are the macro and the operational or structural, and then I can talk about the margin profile. Certainly from a macro perspective, there are probably two impacts that are obviously impacting us. The first one on a macro is the China softness at this stage. And as I called out earlier, we're seeing China revenues in Q4 going down about 20% at this stage in terms of Delphi Technologies. So, that is one macro.","And the other one really is a sort of FX story that we're being impacted by. And that's an important part of the second half performance. If you look at in H2 right now, FX headwinds for us are close to 30 basis points oft margin dilution that is coming from that. Predominantly driven by China itself, as the renminbi profile has changed. So I think from a macro perspective, the China softness with the local OEs, which is relatively good margin, as well as the FX impact of over 30 basis points are probably the more macroeconomic elements towards our margins.","In terms of our own internal element, it really comes down to two major factors. We've called out the first one, which is with GDi Power Electronics. We're going to have GDi \u2013 in Europe, for example, the volume growth remains very strong in Power Electronics. We expect that growth this year to be around about 50%. So, that's a mix impact that we know about, and we've called out.","We are also increasing our engineering spend in the second half of this year, and again I keep on coming back to it, but the level of booking momentum that we have in place right now is something that we're incredibly proud about and something that we believe is something that is putting us in very good shape for the future. And the one thing we are going to do is to invest now to make sure that that revenue projections and that capability that we have continues to be something that we believe can translate into real revenue.","So, I talked a lot there, Armintas, but I think really, from our perspective, China and FX really are the sort of more macroeconomic whereas the sort of mix impacts of GDi Power Electronics as well as the continued focus on engineering is probably more around the internal and operational that we face.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And the China softness, the FX, the down 20%, 30-basis-point margin dilution, that's a year-over-year number?","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yes, that is. Yes.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. And then just with regards to your engineering spend and the products that are coming online, the launches, can you talk through the process as far as how much of it is a normal launch or how much of it is with regards to the investment that you're making, the complexity of these launches that are upcoming?","Mary Gustanski - Delphi Technologies Plc","So, this is Mary Gustanski. It's a mix clearly. The greater level of bookings and the accelerated volumes are certainly creating more engineering dollars to ready for those launches. But, additionally, what we're seeing is increasingly complex solutions, particularly in Power Electronics, as we enable more efficient electrification. Every OEM is trying to accomplish that. But they're trying to accomplish it in a best value way, a way that they can sell vehicles at a reasonable price. And our role is to create the Power Electronics solutions that enable that. And so, certainly there's a lot of engineering being directed. So I would have to say, in a percentage basis, it's probably split when you think about.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Split between sort of normal course launches and launches of more complexity?","Mary Gustanski - Delphi Technologies Plc","Accelerated growth and more complexity.","Vivid Sehgal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yes.

My name is Kalia, and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Delphi Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Jessica Holscott, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations of Delphi. Jessica, you may now begin your conference.","Jessica L. Holscott - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer","Thank you, Kalia. And thank you for joining Delphi's Third Quarter Earnings Call. To follow along with today's presentation, our slides can be found at delphi.com, under the Investors section of the website.","Please see slide two for a disclosure on forward-looking statements, which we'll be making on today's call, and only reflects Delphi's current view of future financial performance which may be materially different from our actual performance.","Joining us today will be Kevin Clark, Delphi's CEO and President and Mark Murphy, our CFO.","As seen on slide three, Kevin will provide an operations update as well as an overview of the quarter, and then Mark will cover the financial results and 2015 outlook in more detail.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thank you, Jessica. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.","Before Mark gets into our financial results, as Jessica mentioned, I'd like to provide some color on our third quarter as well as the outlook for the full year. Let's begin with the macro environment on slide five.","Our full year vehicle production in North America remained solid in line with our prior outlook. European vehicle productions continue to strengthening since our last earnings call. The China market is weaker than what we forecasted when we last reported. At that point in time, we expected vehicle production in China to increase 4% for the full year.","We have a very flexible business model in China, which we've flexed in response to the recent market softness. We've also taken action, including permanent head count reductions and deferred investments, to maintain a right-size cost structure for the changing environment. Although growth has moderated, we remain very bullish on the China market. Our current forecast for 2016 vehicle production growth is up about 4%, and we expect to continue to outpace market growth by roughly eight points to 10 points driven by our technology portfolio that benefits from the trend towards increased vehicle content.","So overall, continued growth in North America and improving European market is expected to partially offset a softer market in China and continued weakness in South America. In addition, lower raw material prices continue to help counter a portion of the negative effect of the stronger dollar.","Now moving to the highlights from the third quarter on slide six, we delivered strong financial results. Revenue growth was four points over the underlying market, operating income totaled a record $470 million. We returned almost $500 million of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our team did a great job executing on 207 program launches. That's actually a 30% increase over last year positioning us for continued acceleration of growth as we head into the fourth quarter as well as 2016.","In addition, during the quarter, we continued to realign our product portfolio to drive increased value through accretive acquisitions that strengthen our competitive position while exiting businesses that don't fit with our strategic and financial objectives. We reached an agreement to acquire Control-Tec, a telematics-based data capture and analytic software company. We closed on the sale of our interest in our Thermal joint venture in Korea, and we expect to complete the sale of our Thermal joint venture interest in China in the second quarter of next year. Lastly, we made significant progress on the integration preparation for the HellermannTyton acquisition, which we expect to close at the end of the year.","Our full year outlook is referenced on slide seven and reflects the current macro environment. In summary, we're expecting revenue growth to increase to six points over market, operating margins to total 13%, EBITDA margins to reach 16.5% and free cash flow of $1.1 billion, providing us with tremendous flexibility to drive shareholder value.","Now we're on track this year to launch approximately 1,100 new product programs across our entire product portfolio. Our new business bookings are expected to exceed 2014 levels, and we'll complete eight transactions that will drive increased shareholder value.","Moving to PACE Award nominations on slide eight, we're very proud of the 17 PACE Awards we've received to date, and we're excited to tell you about three more Delphi technologies that have been named finalists for 2016. Winner will be announced in early April of next year. The PACE Award recognizes innovation and technology achievements in the automotive industry, and Delphi's received more nominations and more awards than any other company in the industry.","For 2016, we received two nominations for our Electrical Architecture technologies and a nomination for one of our Electronics and Safety technologies bringing us to a total of 59 PACE finalists. As I mentioned, that's more than any of our peers. It's third-party validation like this that reflects our ongoing commitment to provide safe, green and connected solutions to meet our customers' challenges.","Moving to slide nine, last month, we had the opportunity to spend time with our customers and technology partners at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The theme of the show was Mobility Connects, and no other theme could be more top-of-mind for the industry. The show was a great venue for exhibiting our portfolio of innovative active safety and automated driving technologies. It was also a great opportunity to align strategies on the subject of vehicle connectivity and mobility with our customers and our technology partners. We came away from the show confident in our ability to provide industry-leading technology that addressed the increased demand for vehicle connectivity, active safety and automated driving solutions.","Now the theme from the Frankfurt Motor Show is a great lead into slide 10.","As you all know, the pace of change is accelerating in our industry and, as a result, the landscape has significantly changed over the last 10 years. Our team spends a great deal of time in Silicon Valley partnering with customers, working with current and future technology partners and meeting with government agencies, doing everything we can to stay in tune with the changing environment.","As a result, we have a pretty clear line of sight on the impact technologies will have on the automotive industry. So to put it in context, Delphi will ship 20 billion lines of code on a daily basis in 2015. In 2019, we expect this to increase to 200 billion, which we expect will translate into almost a three-fold increase in our software-related revenues to over $1.3 billion.","Now to support this pace of change, we're going to significantly increase our presence in Silicon Valley and other global technology hubs, more than double the number of software and systems engineers we have today to over 8,000 and increase the number of technology partners to over 50. These actions will ensure that we're well-positioned to execute on the opportunities in the fast-growing connected car market.","As outlined on slide 11, our Active Safety business continues to be our fastest growing product line. During the third quarter, we booked over $300 million of Active Safety awards bringing our year-to-date total to over $700 million. We're on track to reach over $1 billion of new business bookings in Active Safety for the third straight year in a row.","As a result of new program launches and increased penetration rates, revenues are expected to increase almost 60% year-over-year. That's roughly 40 points faster than the underlying market. To ensure that we remain ahead of the competition to deliver strong profitable revenue growth, we continue to invest in our Active Safety technology portfolio.","In addition to organic investments in our radar and vision technologies, we've also partnered with Quanergy to bring low-cost, solid state LiDAR to market and, as you know, we acquired Ottomatika, a leading provider of automated driving software.","At the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show in January, we'll be showcasing some of our more recent technology developments, including data capabilities and high-speed architectures that are the nervous system for making all these electronics function at greater speeds. We will also demonstrate our latest connective technologies, from 3D clusters to a completely touchless cockpit to help reduce driver distractions.","Slide 12 covers new business bookings, which totaled $7 billion during the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $22 billion. That's $5 billion more than last year at this time and putting us solidly on the path to exceed our prior-year bookings amount. During the quarter, we had several conquest bookings including an infotainment award with a premium European OEM, a cluster award with a major commercial vehicle customer and an Electrical Architecture award with Renault-Nissan. The right side of the chart reflects the geographic mix of our year-to-date bookings, which continues to reflect a balancing of our revenues across regions.","Slide 13 highlights the pace of our acquisitions, investment and divestiture activities, all intended to drive increased returns. Today, we announced an agreement to acquire Control-Tec. I'll touch more on this transaction on the next slide. In addition, during the third quarter we moved closer to completing the sale of the last two joint ventures from our Thermal business. And, as I mentioned, the HellermannTyton acquisition has been approved by their shareholders and is on track to close by the end of the year.","Slide 14 provides an overview of the Control-Tec transaction. The acquisition will be funded with cash and is expected to close during the fourth quarter. Control-Tec is a telematics data collection management and analytics company focused on remote real-time vehicle test data via a secure cloud-based system.","The company offers proprietary software that delivers highly customized data solutions to OEMs that significantly reduce testing cycles and product programs. Immediate synergies between Control-Tec and Delphi are related to leveraging the existing technology into new customers and applying Control-Tec software to new vehicle applications including ADAS. We're very excited about this acquisition, which enhances our offering of scalable, software service solutions.","So summarizing on slide 15, we had another record quarter marked by solid operating performance which we translated into strong revenue and earnings growth. We expect to deliver strong operating performance during the balance of the year with an acceleration of revenue growth and continued strong margin expansion and cash flow generation. We continue to be disciplined in our allocation of capital, using our free cash flow generation to both fund acquisitions and return cash to shareholders, and we continue to execute our plan for portfolio modifications that'll accelerate our earnings growth and increase returns.","I'll now turn the call over to Mark for a more detailed look at our third quarter financial results.","Mark?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning everyone. Consistent with prior calls, today's review of our actual and forecasted financials excludes restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations of Delphi. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP is included at the back of this presentation and the press release.","Slide 17 provides a snapshot of our third quarter financial performance.","Reported revenue totaled $3.6 billion, up 6% on an adjusted basis. Third quarter operating income increased to a record $470 million. Operating margins expanded 110 basis points year-over-year to 12.9%. Earnings per share were $1.28, up nearly 20% excluding the effects of currency and commodities. During the quarter, we returned $477 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Slide 18 provides greater detail on revenue.","Revenue of $3.6 billion reflects $317 million of year-over-year currency and commodity headwinds, mostly offset by strong underlying volume growth. In Europe, adjusted revenue increased 6%. Growth in Europe was driven by strong volume growth in Electrical Architecture. With program launches across all segments, we project Europe's growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter.","North America adjusted revenue increased 9%, or four points over market, primarily driven by our Powertrain and Electrical Architecture businesses. Growth in China was 3%, or 11 points over market, and driven by Electrical Architecture and Infotainment. South America performed in line with the market but was down on continued underlying market weakness.","Slide 19 walks the third quarter year-over-year change in operating income to a record $470 million, up 11% excluding currency and commodity effects. Operating margins expanded 110 basis points year-over-year at 12.9%, primarily due to volume leverage and continued productivity gains.","Slide 20 covers our segments. On an adjusted basis, Electrical Architecture's revenue increased 6%, or four points over market, with growth in North America, Europe and Asia. Powertrain program launches drove growth of 4% with especially strong growth in North America.","Electronics and Safety revenue increased 6%, or four points over market. With product launches in Active Safety and Infotainment, we expect strong Electronics and Safety growth in the fourth quarter. Operating margins expanded across all segments on volume growth and operating performance. Electrical Architecture expanded margins 100 basis points to 13.5%, Powertrain, 150 basis points to 11.7% and Electronics and Safety, 70 basis points to 12.3%.","Turning to slide 21, operating income growth and share repurchases drove EPS growth of 13% for the period. Excluding the effects of currency and commodities, earnings per share grew nearly 20%.","Slide 22 provides our full year guidance assumptions. We've reduced our full year market outlook to reflect weaker China and South America markets partially offset by stronger Europe production. Our guidance maintains $1.10 euro rate. We've lower renminbi and real rates to reflect current market conditions.","Our full year guidance is on slide 23. Our latest revenue outlook is driven primarily by weaker China and currency effects. Our operating income guidance reflects the lower volumes and currency effects partially offset by strong operating performance. Our EPS range is $5.15 to $5.25 with a projected tax rate of 16%.","In summary, Delphi had a record third quarter in the face of significant currency and regional volume headwinds. In the fourth quarter, we project growth to strengthen on program launches and an improving China market. Our full year financial outlook reflects expanding growth over market and continued strong operating performance driving solid earnings growth and cash flow generation.","With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some final thoughts.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sure. Thanks, Mark.","Before we open up the lines for questions, I would like to make a few closing comments on 2015.","Taking a step back, we delivered tremendous operating performance in what ended up being a much more volatile market than we'd originally expected both from an industry volume as well as an FX standpoint, as Mark alluded to.","Our performance in this environment validates the robustness of our business model, which is reflected in the numbers Mark just reviewed with you: six points of growth over market for the full year; 60 basis points of margin expansion; and roughly $1.5 billion of cash, which we'll ultimately return to shareholders throughout the year. We've also made tremendous progress repositioning our product portfolio to further drive shareholder value.","So with that as a backdrop and what we believe will be an improving macro environment going forward, we strongly believe that we're well-positioned for continued strong financial performance into 2016.","So, operator, we'll now open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question will come from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning, Rod.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Couple questions on the guidance.","Operator","","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you guys hear me?","Operator","And that question has been withdrawn. Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys. Can you hear me?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hello, John.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you guys hear me? Hello. Hello.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hello, John.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you hear me, Kevin?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, we can hear you. I don't know what the problem was.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I mean, the first question and, sorry to jump over you here, Rod. But just the first question is as we think about 2016, and I know you guys aren't laying out guidance yet in the backlog beyond that, I mean, is there anything that is changing here in the short run that would change your view of margins or your backlog going forward?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No. Listen, let's start with margins. I mean, we'll end the year with 16.5% EBITDA margins, 13% operating margins, so strong performance, operating performance of margin expansion on a year-over-year basis in a market where you look at industry volume growth that was relatively muted given the impact of China.","As you look at kind of go forward, we're going through our planning process right now. As we look at industry volumes net-net, probably pretty consistent with what we talked about at our Investor Day a year ago. We'd expect industry volumes to be up probably 2% to 3% on a year-over-year basis. Obviously, China a little bit slower. If we were to call the ball (20:24) today, China vehicle production, like I said, up about 4% on a year-over-year basis.","And as we've implied in our fourth quarter guidance and heading into next year, you're going to see a continued ramp-up in growth over market. Fourth quarter guidance has year-over-year revenue growth up 7.5% on our outlook for vehicle production of flat, growth in vehicle production. So tremendous growth on a year-over-year basis. So hopefully that answers you question.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, that's very helpful. And then just a second question. You alluded to some deferred investment in China, and I notice CapEx guidance went down by about $50 million. I mean, does that signal anything about what's going on in China and your capital allocation strategy, or is that really just timing?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No. Listen, we're real optimistic. We're still optimistic about China. For the third quarter, it was significantly weaker than what we originally estimated. If you recall, our outlook was China up about 3.5% or 4% in the third quarter; ended up actually being down 9%. So it was very fluid. For the fourth quarter, our original outlook was China volume up roughly 5%. Current outlook is basically down a point.","However, when we look at sequentially third to fourth quarter, we are starting to see a pickup in orders, a strengthening in the market, sequential growth in vehicle production from Q3 to Q4, based on current outlook, is about up 30%. So we are seeing an acceleration, although down on a year-over-year basis.","And as we head into next year, as I said, we're expecting vehicle production to grow 4%. And I think what's important, as you've heard us articulate before, we're confident that we'll continue to grow at eight points to 10 points over vehicle production rates in China given the product portfolios or product areas that we sit in: Powertrain; Electronics and Safety; and Electrical Architecture.","John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's great. And then just lastly on Active Safety and the software business, I mean, if you could just kind of give us some guidance on how fast Active Safety rolls onto the vehicle once it's booked. I mean, how fast do these launches come? Are they the regular cadence versus your launches or your business wins or do they come faster? And then, also, as we look at that and software, it does seem like both Active Safety and software will have much higher margins than we're looking at on a corporate average. Just if you can give us some directional guidance or even actual numbers around the margins on those businesses.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sure, so Active Safety, the roll-on of Active Safety is consistent with other E&S businesses, usually two to maybe three years. So the E&S business, whether it's infotainment and Active Safety, tends to roll on faster or sooner than businesses like our Powertrain business, so it tends to be at the shorter end. Now there's some variability by program, as you can imagine.","As we've said, Active Safety today, we're investing in. I mean, the reality is it's an areas where we're putting, we're allocating a significant amount of resources to deal with the demand in the market and for the business pursuit. So today, we're in invest mode. When we get to a run rate of about $350 million, that's what we've guided to in the past, we end up at margins rates that are roughly in line in E&S current margin rates.","With respect to software, you're right. Ultimately, those are businesses there are, by and large, software businesses and that's, quite frankly, where the E&S business, in the aggregate, those product lines are headed. And I think once you get to a run rate, you're not significantly ramping up investment, you're at margin rates that are higher than the Delphi margin","(24:16-30:29)","It's not a product we're selling or is commercialized. It's a product that we're developing from a commercial standpoint. So effectively, it can be, from a cost standpoint, commercially viable, right? That's our objective with Quanergy and in our partnering there. How do we bring the cost of LiDAR down so it is usable and functional, especially you try to enable level-three, level-four automated driving.","Our strengths today are really in active safety and visioning, our radar envisioning systems. We're seeing demand across both product areas. When you talk about the nature of the industry, there's a lot of activity. There's a lot of activity within the supply base. There's a lot of activity \u2013 folks like ourselves \u2013 with various partners, technology partners, as well as a lot of activity partnering with our OE customers. So it's a very exciting area. There's a lot of interest, and it's the reason that you see the significant amount of revenue growth that we're currently experiencing.","Unknown Speaker","So I think at your Analyst Day, you were expecting to gain market share within the Active Safety space. Are you just with the right customers and, as a virtue of that, you're going to be picking up share or is there a particular capability that's doing it?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I think it's both. I think it's \u2013 we've been with Volvo for a long time, and as you know, their brand is safety. And that's an OE customer that we've had a very long-term strategic relationship with. I think in addition to that, you look at our history. We've been in radar technology for a long time, right? And it dates back to the days of Delphi and our E&S division and business or cooperation with Hughes Electronics years and years ago. So we have very strong radar capabilities.","So I would say that's a very strong competitive advantage and one that we're leveraging. With respect to market share gains, given the fact that we're growing 40 points over the underlying market, clearly we are gaining share. And again, that's given our capabilities and that's partnering with the right technology partners as well as with the right customers.","Unknown Speaker","Great. I will leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me now?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning, Rod. Yeah. Sorry, for the technology problems, Rod.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. I didn't hear the call for a couple minutes, and I don't want to have you guys repeat yourselves so just tell if you've covered it and I'll take it offline. But, I was hoping just to get a little bit more clarification on the guidance for the fourth quarter?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sure.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So it looks like the midpoint of your Q4 is $3.74 billion or $3.75 billion something like that, but it looks like it's down a little bit over $400 million \u2013 $407 million. Can you give us a high level bridge just to sort of walk us through some of the big components? What are you seeing as FX and commodity? What's the organic growth or divestiture impacts that we should be thinking about, because it looks a little bit lower than I think what was expected previously?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. And just, Rod, and I'll comment and Mark will chime in. Just to make sure that we're speaking off the same numbers. So you're right, midpoint about $3.75 billion. That's about a $195 million change from the prior implied guidance, right? So you mentioned a different number.","When you look at that, what are the big changes? China, as I mentioned, we were forecasting China vehicle production of 5.5% the last time we gave guidance for the fourth quarter and it's come in down a point. That's our current outlook. So almost a 700 basis point swing. That translates into about $70 million, $80 million of lost revenue in China for the quarter. In addition to that, you have the impact of full quarter of the weakened RMB as well as the Brazilian real which is another $80 million. So those are the big, those, quite frankly, are the big contributors to the change. Mark, do you want to...?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, that's right, Rod, and on the volume side, we've got some, beyond China, some incremental commercial vehicle and aftermarket. But it's principally China, as Kevin mentioned, and the related volume flow-through and then the FX impact on the OI as well. (35:35)","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Can you just maybe share with us what the organic growth looks like to you just on a year-over-year basis, just adjusted for some of these things?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yes, so year-over-year organic growth in the fourth quarter is going to be 7.5% \u2013 7-plus points over market.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And as we're thinking about the outlook for next year, it's been just a bit of time since you guys provided your backlog. But can you just give us high- level expectations for how that organic growth should look next year? There was an expectation that it would accelerate year-over-year, and what \u2013 how we should think about the relative performance of the divisions?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah I think, listen, based on \u2013 we're in our planning process now \u2013 I'd expect growth over market to be basically, roughly in line with what the prior implied growth over market was when we had our Investor Day in April of last year. So really no change, and I think it would be consistent, really, across each of our segments, strongest growth at E&S, probably would expect stronger growth in E\/EA than what we implied just given their performance to date. Maybe slightly softer growth in Powertrain given the performance of the commercial vehicle market today.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Are you expecting any dislocations related to diesel or Volkswagen, which is a significant customer, at this point?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","We haven't seen any to date. We've seen no impact on order rates. If you recall, our prior forecast, Rod, actually assumed that light duty diesel was going to be relatively flat and, when you looked at penetration rates in Europe, that light duty diesel penetration rates would actually decline on a couple points over roughly a three-year timeframe. But from a revenue standpoint for us, it was relatively flat. So we don't think that changes at this point in time. To the extent it does change, as we've talked to you about in the past, you look at \u2013 it's important for the OEs. The OEs in reality, in our view, need diesel to hit the CLT targets.","To the extent they decide they want to deviate away from diesel over the medium term, they have to replace with high-end gas systems, systems with GDI. A diesel system tends to run about 500 hours. A GDI system with variable valve train would be, I don't know, about 350 hours, so 60% to 70% on a content basis of a diesel.","And then you probably would need to outfit the engine with some hybrid technology which, as you know for us, additional electrification adds significantly more content. So net-net, for us, we don't think it's a big headwind assuming the OEs are still trying to achieve the CLT targets that are out there.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just lastly, I know that the commodity bridges are a bit more complex because copper's passed through. But just on a \u2013 if you would to assume commodities are at the level that you see today, just on an EBIT basis, how do you think about the effect looking out to next year?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","If commodities remain where they are today, I mean, there's been some weakening in commodity prices during the year. So maybe there's a slight pickup on a year-over-year basis, but we don't think it'd be big. Mark?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","They're not that large.","Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Galves of Credit Suisse.","Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Same as Rod. I was off the call for a few minutes, so just let me know if the questions have been asked. It looks like the price downs have been ticking up a little bit throughout the year. Is that anything to be concerned about? Can you just kind of address that?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it's really mix. It's, at the end of the day, E&S is, and you'll see it in the fourth quarter, very strong E&S growth. And as we said in the past, E&S relatively to other businesses, E&S price downs tend to average 2% to 3% on an annual basis. And to the extent they're a bigger part of the overall revenue mix, you're going to naturally see price downs higher than what we've historically reflected of roughly 1.5%.","Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Sounds good. And then longer term, you touched on hybridization as a positive. Have you seen any uptick in bidding activity for plug-in hybrids or EVs? I also know that over the past couple of years, I think you've sort of de-risked your backlog by taking a more conservative approach to what, how much volume these programs would do. Is there any upside in the next few years in new business if these vehicles actually started ticking in some traction and the volumes came through as the automakers expected?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, if they came through, there definitely would be upside. You're absolutely right. We've significantly de-risked the backlog. We've been disappointed with respect to EV volumes to date. We are on some EV programs or we have EV platforms and are working with customers on EV programs.","In terms of the near-term activity, it really isn't any different than what it was a year or two ago. So we'll see as we head into next year and into 2017. I think the important thing from our perspective, EVs or hybrids are great for us. They have anywhere between four to seven times the vehicle content of a standard vehicle. So it's a big revenue opportunity when it occurs, when it happens.","Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, got it. And then in China, I know you're expecting minus 1% in Q4. Is that including commercial trucks? And it looks like on the light vehicle side, the shipments in October to date are a lot better than that. What's your view of minus 1% based on, and do you think that the tax stimulus or order activity is indicating anything better for Q4 potentially?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, so when we talk about vehicle production rates, we always include commercial. It includes passenger car and commercial vehicles.","Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So when we reference volumes, we include both. So it does include commercial vehicle. We have seen some strengthening in schedule since the incentive program has been put in place on 1.6 liter engines or less. That's about 70% of our volume in China in terms of when you look at those vehicles. That tends to be weighted towards more passenger car then SUV or truck which, near term, is good for us. So the near term traction has been factored into our guidance. To the extent there's incremental traction, there will upside to our numbers. But at this point in time, we're waiting to see how much of that happens and for how long.","Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak of RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question, and I was actually cut off for a while, so I apologize if this was addressed. But I just want to understand, you talked about some of the expanding organic growth in outperformance versus the market in the fourth quarter, which is good to see. But the guidance also implies that the margins are flat on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter versus the expansion you're seeing in the first three. So is there something that we should be thinking about that's an offset there or, if organically, some of that outperformance seems to be getting better?","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Joe, we do have some increased engineering spend and IT-related spend to support some programs in the future. They're typically about $25 million; some of it related to some rebuild. So if you were to adjust for that, Joe, I'd say $25 million, margins would be closer to 13.7% or so in the fourth.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, if I can \u2013 so there's some timing. So last year, there was $25 million of incremental rebuilds in the fourth quarter of last year just given the cadence of programs that we don't have in the fourth quarter of this year. And then the second piece, to provide some additional color to Mark's comment on engineering, and he's absolutely right. You look at a division like E&S in the Active Safety and Infotainment launches \u2013 putting an example, on a sequential basis, our launch activity in E&S is going to be up over 40%. So nearer term, we will incur some incremental engineering to launch those programs, and that will be reflected in the E&S margins, quite frankly, in the fourth quarter.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just on China, over the course of the year, you mentioned that China could be flattish for the year and you'd be able to sort of flex and scale and scale down and still maintain the low end of the previous range. And now that market forecast seems to be \u2013 have come to fruition, but there was a little bit of a guide down. So is that some of the still investing for the future growth in China that you're talking about, some of the long-term bullishness that's not maybe causing you to flex down to meet the lower volume as much as you otherwise would have?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. No, listen, I think at the end of the day, the China market's a little bit worse than what we predicted. I think if you look at our performance and actions, our guide was if China volumes decline from 4% full year, which was our prior outlook, to flat, we could hold profitability. We're going to be below that. In addition, you have the impact of FX, both translation and some transaction, quite frankly, as well as, as Mark said, a slightly softer CV and aftermarket business. So those are really the big changes.","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Joe. I would just add that there were a lot of actions, and that's why the flow through on that lost volume is actually quite low.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And particularly in China. So had it been \u2013 we lost for totally a year on that, roughly $300 million in volume; we only lost about $40 million of OI. Had it flowed through at normal rates, we'd have lost probably $80 million to $100 million, so that's a tribute to the cost reduction activities done by the business.","Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lim of Wells Fargo.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning, David.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So the question I have is on Q4, the outlook. Was there any kind of launch delays or program cancelations in China? I was wondering if you could give a little bit more detail on news related to that","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No, no cancelation of programs or launch delays. I'm sure some programs that were in launch, volumes were lower than what originally were planned. But nothing major there.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got you. And then RMB, I know that you gave some \u2013 the number about $80 million impact. Wondering, and that's including the Real. If you just isolate RMB, what was the RMB portion of that?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","It's about $50 million.","David H. Lim - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","$50 million, okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Parikh Yan (48:27) of Morgan Stanley.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning, everyone. Couple of questions here and more based on some of the long-term industry trends. The House Energy Committee recently proposed a bill to give fuel economy credits for active safety content in the car. So A, wanted to get your thoughts on that proposal, and B, perhaps more importantly, what kind of fuel economy improvements can we see because of the vehicle can now be driven a lot more efficiently because of stuff like adaptive cruise control, emergency braking and all the nine technologies mentioned in the bill, if internally there has been an assessment on what that range could be?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No, there absolutely has been. Listen, as I said in my comments, we actually spend a lot of time with the government regulators. Actually, NHTSA Administrator Rosekind was out at our offices in Silicon Valley with Jeff Owens, who you all know, talking about Active Safety and Technologies in and around Active Safety. So those are dialogues that we're having all the time.","With respect to fuel economy improvement when you think about automated driving, our estimates, and we validate it with other outside sources, is it results in roughly a 9% to 10% improvement in overall fuel economy. So there's mileage and CO2 benefits in addition to the safety benefits. I wasn't sure if you were asking the question about adoption of NCAP in the U.S. or not, if that was the initial part of your, the initial part of your question.","Unknown Speaker","I wasn't, but feel free to add some color there.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Okay. I apologize for the misunderstanding. But our view, based on our discussions, we think at some point in time in the 2017 calendar year or by the 2017 calendar year, Active Safety will be a part of the U.S. NCAP standards, which will be very, very helpful in terms of accelerating penetration rates of the technology in the U.S.","Unknown Speaker","Excellent. That's great color. The second question I have is on EVs, and you mention about having incremental content of vehicle opportunity in an EV car. If you were to rank the segments in order of incremental CPV opportunity from EV penetration, how would you rank your three segments?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","It's probably first, quite frankly, Electrical Architecture, second Electronics and Safety. Those are the two and, on a relative basis, it's significant for both. But when you think about the Electrical Architecture necessary for a full EV, it's really significant. Now in the E&S business we manufacture, develop and manufacture invertors and converters. Quite frankly, the PACE nomination for the Electronics and Safety divisions is for an inverter product or an inverter technology. Both would benefit but, I think incrementally, it would be the E\/EA business from an absolute dollar standpoint.","Unknown Speaker","Understood. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hoselton of KeyBanc.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen. I was also cut off, so I apologize.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No, we apologize.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Two different questions here. First, 2016, it sounds as though your backlog is kind of relatively intact and then production outlook maybe a little bit weaker in China or something along those lines. But I'm wondering, from a margin perspective, what are your general expectations for margins in 2016? Can you continue to see that margin expansion that you've kind of outlined in some of your previous presentations?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. I mean, listen, based on how we've performed this year, I mean, that was my point after Mark's wrap up. When you really look at how we've performed, our revenue growth as well as our margin expansion in 2015 in what was a pretty challenging market when you think about changing industry volumes, when you think about FX and commodity prices, I mean, market was extremely volatile, we're going to add 60 basis points year-over-year to margins. And I think we're in the midst of our business planning today. I think it will be at a similar sort of level next year roughly 50 basis points and well on our way to 17.5% EBITDA margin in 2017.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then secondly, as far as capital deployment, you certainly made a lot of acquisitions, some of them smaller, maybe one larger one in particular. But how do we think about your emphasis on acquisitions versus share repurchase?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, we think can do both. This year, I think, was a great example. We'll end up buying over $1 billion of stock this year as well as completing the acquisition of HellermannTyton and Control-Tec as well as applying Ottomatika in making investments in Tula Technology as well as Quanergy. So given the cash flow dynamics of our business, we actually think we can do both.","I think our preference, to the extent we can find really value strategic, value accretive M&A opportunities, our bias would be in that direction. To the extent we don't find value accretive transactions and we invest organically and we have extra free cash flow, certainly we'll return that to shareholders via the repurchase of stock as well as dividends.","Brett D. Hoselton - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot. Thank you very much.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Chris McNally of Evercore ISI.","Chris McNally - Evercore, International Strategy & Investment (UK) Ltd.","Good morning, everyone.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning, Chris.","Chris McNally - Evercore, International Strategy & Investment (UK) Ltd.","Wanted to just circle back to Q4 and the revenue shortfall because I think that's, you were getting a bunch of iinvestor questions about it because it sounds like 2016 remains on track. And if I understand your comments, it sounds about half of the shortfall came from China production, half from FX and the FX insight is helpful for us. But our question is where was the offset from European production, which was probably revised up from your guide, and if we look at other supplier implied revenue guidance for Q4, there was the European offset to the China downside.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, for us, Europe from an automotive standpoint, up $30 million for the quarter. So China down $70 million, right, South America down $10 million, Europe up $30 million, commercial vehicle, we talked about, down $20 million to $30 million and then some softness in aftermarket.","Chris McNally - Evercore, International Strategy & Investment (UK) Ltd.","Okay. So that's fair. Is it also fair to say, though, that given some of the upside that we're seeing in the China production schedules you mentioned in Q4, you gave 4% for 2016, should we think about this revenue shortfall as a one quarter issue given that backlog remains, as you said throughout the call, pretty much on target with your 2015 Analyst Day comments?","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, listen, I'm not sure I'd call it revenue shortfall. I'm not trying to be flippant about it.","Chris McNally - Evercore, International Strategy & Investment (UK) Ltd.","Sure.","Kevin P. Clark - President, CEO, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I think at the end of the day, the market changed, right, and we're impacted by vehicle production. S, to the extent the vehicle production was not as strong or is stronger than what we had expected, it affects our revenues. We had thought, in fact, when we gave Q3, Q4 revenue guidance, that vehicle production in China was going to be up 5.5% in the fourth quarter. It looks like it's going be down. It's going to be down 1%. And as a result, that affects us from a revenue standpoint.","As you head into 2016, our prior outlook for China was up kind of 6% for 2016, 2017, if we called the ball (56:50) today, like I told you, we'd probably stay up 4% so slightly slower growth but we'd expect to still grow roughly eight points to 10 points over that market. So it would be still very strong growth but off of a slightly lower base.","Chris McNally - Evercore, International Strategy & Investment (UK) Ltd.","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","Jessica L. Holscott - Vice President-Investor Relations and Treasurer","Great. Thank you for participating in today's call. Once quick calendar item before we wrap up.

My name is Jorgen and I'll be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Delphi Technologies' Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being accorded and simultaneously webcast.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sherief Bakr, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sherief, please go ahead.","Sherief Bakr","Thank you, Jorgen, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to Delphi Technologies' third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today in Rochester is our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Dauch; and our Chief Financial Officer, Vivid Sehgal.","This call will include a discussion of our third quarter 2019 financial results as disclosed in today's press release, as well as updated outlook for our 2019. In order to follow along with today's presentation, you can find an accompanying set of slides on our Investor Relations website at ir.delphi.com.","Please note that our discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to their corresponding GAAP measures in the tables within our press release. In addition, references to changes in revenue are on adjusted basis excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements.","Now, before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q as well as other filings with the SEC. I'd encourage all of you to review these risk factors listed in these documents.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Dauch","Thank you, Sherief, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Over the last three quarters, you've heard me talk about the tremendous opportunity we have here Delphi Technologies to create value for our shareholders. Despite the near-term challenges, our industry is facing I remain confident and passionate about the opportunity to create stronger and more profitable Delphi Technologies over the next two to three years. ","Since becoming the CEO here, you\u2019ve heard me talk about the process I've gone through to fully understand both our strength and our weaknesses as a company. As you'll see in today's press release, we are taking the necessary actions to address one of our weaknesses in order to reshape and refocus our company into the industry's propulsion technology leader.","We will become a leaner and more flexible organization. Now that we are truly independent company, we had the freedom to do just that. Doing so allow us to significantly improve our profitability, and our cash flow profile, enabling us to invest for profitable future growth. ","I'll come back to this in a few minutes and take you through our key operational initiatives. And our restructuring plans in more detail. Like many of you on the call today our working assumption is that our industry both in the passenger car and commercial vehicle sides will continue the softness through 2020 albeit with some areas of strong growth in our advanced technologies, specifically higher pressure fuel injection systems, and Power Electronics.","The good news for Delphi Technologies is that we have industry leading technology in both and our launch profile supported by booked business that is set to deliver significant growth in 2020 and beyond in these two key areas of our portfolio. With the steps we are taking to address our cost structure and the improvements we are making in our operational performance and program launch execution capabilities. We are fully committed to deliver on our vision to be the pioneers of propulsion and create significant value for our all stakeholders.","Turning to our third quarter performance on slide two, at a macro level our 8% year-on-year drop revenue decline was a couple of points lower than the outlook we gave last quarter, primarily driven by softer global production, primarily in China, India and Europe. Adjusted operating margin of 6.9% was negatively impacted by lower volumes, incremental FX headwinds, internal operating issues, as well as a strike at General Motors.","Despite this, operating cash flow was a relatively robust $59 million and we remain highly focused on improving our cash flow performance in 2020 and beyond. Vivid will talk about more about this in more detail during his remarks.","From an operational and commercial perspective, we had another quarter of strong progress hitting a number of important milestones, as well as moving quickly on our critically important lean systems implementation initiatives. ","We actually got our final transition service agreement with our former parent on August 31, which for the first time, since our separation gives us the ability to drive structural efficiencies, and improvements, particularly in the area of IT. Finally, we secured approximately $1 billion of new gross bookings in the quarter across our fuel injection and powertrain parts portfolios.","Moving to slide three, in addition to weaker than expected global production in Q3, we continue to be impacted by a number of industry wide technology transitions, as well as macroeconomic and customer headwinds. And as I mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, we expect this choppiness and uncertainty to continue over the coming quarters. These dynamics include the accelerated transition from passenger car diesel to gasoline engines, especially in Europe. The near-term projected growth and timing of electrification mostly in China and Europe, which has happened slower than originally forecast this year.","The expected cyclical decline in heavy duty trucks, especially North America, and shorter term demand softness in the aftermarket space, largely from some destocking by certain customers in Europe, which we expect to continue in Q4, as well as the ongoing political, trade and tariff dynamics across the globe.","In addition, you've also seen the strike action at General Motors, which has impacted production and supply chain in late Q3 and early Q4. We are happy to see this issue resolved and we are ready to get back to supplying key GM facilities in North America. At a high level, we now expect global light vehicle production to decline by approximately 7% in 2019. And this is an update to our prior view of an approximate 5% decline.","Looking forward, we expect a challenging industry and macro dynamics to continue into 2020. We need to become a far leaner and more agile to adapt to these market pressures, as well as overcome our own near-term transitional and business mix headwinds.","At the same time, it's also clear that the long-term secular growth drivers of our business remained intact. And the long-term structural shift to more efficient powertrains is accelerating. This presents tremendous content for vehicle and revenue growth opportunity for us. We have strong relationship with customers across the globe, which is reflected in the business wins we have secured in power electronics, GDI, and commercial vehicle fuel injection systems over the last couple of years.","Let's move to the next slide. Building on our commercial successes, we remain committed to delivering pioneering technology to our customers from groundbreaking higher pressure internal combustion engine systems to our next generation inverter technology for electrified vehicles. And on the subject to breaking ground, we were delighted to cut the ribbon on our new electronics electrification plant in Blonie, Poland in early September. This new world class facility is one of the five dedicated electrification.","Over the last two years, we have invested approximately $50 million to establish our global manufacturing presence in preparation for the electronic propulsion systems growth we see in the future. We are working to train our people and qualified our new process equipment at these new sites in order to complete a final operational separation from our former parent by Q1 2020.","At the IAA Motor Show in Frankfort, we showcased our industry leading 500 Bar GDI system, as well as our 800 volt silicon carbide inverter, which helps to significantly extend range and reduce charging times relative to today's state-of-the-art systems. ","We also announced that we are partnering with CREE and will use their Wolfspeed silicon carbide based MOSFETs for our future generation of inverters. Feedback from our customers was terrific, and we will continue to be highly selective on future pursuit opportunities, adhering to our robust profitability and ROIC hurdles.","Our focus on improving profitability and returns is a good segue into the transformational plan we announced this morning, which will fundamentally realign and reshape Delphi Technologies into a leaner and more competitive propulsion system supplier. Slide five takes you through some of those details.","On last quarter\u2019s call, I commented that we have a legacy overhead cost structure and engineering footprint and when benchmarked to both our industry peers and the future needs of our company we identified it to be a target rich opportunity to meaningfully improve our cost structure and profitability. Today's announcement underscores that view. Vivid will take you through the financial details and the expected benefits to our operating income and cash flow performance.","But at a high level, our Board of Directors has approved a comprehensive restructuring plan, which is expected to reduce our costs by more than $150 million in 2022, eliminate nine engineering sites and more than 2,000 positions, more than 10% of our total workforce and improve our free cash flow by $300 million over the course of the plan.","We've been very thorough in our analysis, taking methodical and phased approach to give us the flexibility to adapt to market -- changing market conditions without disrupting more than 160 ongoing new product development and customer programs that we\u2019ll launch in 2020 to 2023. These actions while difficult for those affected are necessary and we will work with urgency and focus to ensure we deliver on our targets.","I strongly believe that these actions combined with our aftermarket 2020 initiative and our focus on lean capabilities will accelerate our return to profitable growth. We estimate that the average payback on our restructuring is only slightly over 1-year and with the bulk of the savings expected to be realized in 2021 and 2022.","Turn to slide six, starting with our engineering footprint, we currently have 23 engineering sites in 13 countries, many of which are underutilized or are simply not in the right location, a function of our heritage and legacy structure, as well as our evolving customer and powertrain technology mix. As you see on slide six we plan to close nine of our sites, four in Europe, two in North America, two in Asia Pacific and one South America.","This will transform our engineering footprint and cost structure making us more focused on our future growth technologies, power electronics, fuel injection systems, both GDI and commercial vehicle diesel, as well as select powertrain components where we are market leaders.","We will be well positioned to meet our customers changing technology needs in all three of our major operating regions. Following the completion of the plan, our engineering footprint will be focused on six global engineering centers of excellence, three for electrification one in each region, one for advanced gasoline fuel injection systems, one for select gasoline powertrain products, and one for high pressure diesel systems for commercial vehicles.","In total, we expect to reduce our engineering headcount by more than 1,500 or close to 30% of our total engineering workforce, and also reduce our total engineering footprint by more than 40%. From a product perspective, approximately two-thirds of the engineering headcount reductions are in diesel and legacy powertrain products, which will result in a more efficient and growth oriented engineering base.","The balance of the cost savings are expected to come from the reductions related to our SG&A and operations, some of which are tied to our geographically dispersed engineering footprint. Ultimately, these actions will make us a stronger and more profitable company, one that is better positioned to meet the changing needs of our customers, while providing us with a more capital allocation optionality in the future.","Let's move to slide seven. Before turning the call over to Vivid, I wanted to update you on the operational progress we have made over the last three months, as well as sharing some of our key priorities as we look forward into 2020. Overall, we continue to make solid progress, while laying the foundation to generate sustainable improvement in a number of key areas. That said given our financial performance and the prevailing industry headwinds we are facing we have to work with even greater speed and urgency to improve our performance.","First, as I mentioned we continue to be on track to becoming a truly standalone company this presents a major opportunity for us to move to common systems and business processes over the next few years.","Second, I remain pleased with the progress we have made with our GDI business and continue to expect breakeven probability for GDI by the end of 2020. Between now and then we have a number of key launches that must be executed flawlessly, both internally by our team and also by our supply chain partners.","Third, crucially we are continuing to prioritize technology investments that deliver real value to our customers allowing them to meet increasingly stringent regulatory standards and highlight our technology led strategy across the range of advanced propulsion systems. ","The restructuring program we have announced today will allow us to selectively increase our investments to further differentiate our technology leadership in areas such as our next generation inverter for Power Electronics, 500 bar and above GDI for passenger cars, and our 3,000 bar diesel system for commercial vehicles, all aligned with future regulatory timelines and standards across the globe.","Fourth, we are continuing to build on the foundational work our leadership team has done to improve the profitability and position our aftermarket business for accelerated global growth. The aftermarket business is a nice business for us here at Delphi.","Fifth, last quarter I referenced some of the new leadership talent we have brought in to the organization to address some of our key challenges. Specifically in our manufacturing, quality and program management launch systems. These are critically important areas for us to address given our recent business wins and upcoming launch activities. Our multiyear journey to become a true lean systems company is well underway, with significant opportunities already identified to improve our cash flow conversion cycle.","We have added two new executives, both experts in lean systems who have worked with me at prior companies. Together we have implemented a multi-step process to implement lean operating systems at over 50 sites around the world. Read the book 50-50 20 [ph] if you want to understand the processes we are implementing here at Delphi Technologies.","We will focus our efforts on improving the overall value streams and cash conversion cycles of the company. Today we have over 40 days of inventory in hand. World class Tier 1 automotive suppliers operate with 20 to 25 days of total inventory. That's a huge target rich environment for us to address.","We also have quickly identified several operational issues at specific sites or suppliers that can be improved in the areas of capacity utilization, machine uptime, first time quality and scrap. These are fundamental operating issues that can and will be addressed with training, improved process discipline, and minimal investments in machinery and tooling. Our teams are already hard at work attacking these opportunities for improvement.","And of course, we are now operating at full speed to implement our transformation plan and take the necessary steps to improve our financial performance. During the third quarter, we initiated an SG&A focused restructuring, which will eliminate 200 positions by early 2020. This will help kick start our cost savings momentum started in Q4 this year.","Moving to slide eight, to become the CEO of Delphi Technologies, we have faced a number of incremental macro and industry headwinds that we need to absorb and overcome. No doubt we have a lot of work ahead of us. But my confidence and motivation to lead Delphi Technologies through its journey and to becoming a great company in the pioneers of propulsion technologies solutions and services has never been stronger.","It all starts with our technology and compelling value proposition to our customers. That is not in question. What is also in question is that we have an uncompetitive legacy overhead cost structure and footprint, which we will transform over the next two to three years. To the actions we have announced today, we will soon be a more focused, leaner and more agile company.","Ultimately, we are focused on delivering margin expansion and significantly higher levels of free cash flow over the long-term, which we believe provides a compelling value creation opportunity. Our call today has been held here at Rochester, New York, one of the impacted R&D sites in the restructuring. ","While we will treat every impacted employee with the respect they deserve, my presence here today shows the urgency I placed on enacting and delivering on our restructuring commitments. Our leadership teams around the world are also working with an urgency that gives me confidence and the tremendous potential of Delphi Technologies.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Vivid.","Vivid Sehgal","Thank you, Rick. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. My remarks will focus on our Q3 performance and revised full year outlook, taking you through the details and phasing of our three year transformation plan, which we expect will deliver significant cost savings and support margin expansion from next year and providing some commentary on 2020 and why I'm confident we can generate significantly higher free cash flow next year. ","Looking at our Q3 performance in more detail on slide nine, revenue of $1.03 billion in the quarter declined by 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in GDI and our aftermarket business, which was more than offset by decline in passenger car diesel revenues in Europe, lower sales in China and India, lower overall global production and the impact of the GM strike. ","Adjusted operating income of $71 million or 6.9% margin declined year-on-year and came in slightly below our prior outlook. Excluding the impact of the GM strike, as well as the incremental foreign exchange headwinds our adjusted operating margin would have been 20 basis points higher at 7.1%. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.56, while operating cash flow of $59 million increased by $5 million versus 2018. As we look out to 2020 and beyond cash flow performance remains a key priority for us.","Turning to slide 10, which provides more detail on our revenue progression in the quarter. We estimate that global light vehicle production declined by close to 4%, 3 percentage points lower than we assumed three months ago. In addition, we saw an incremental softness in global commercial vehicle production, particularly in North America, Europe and India. This is a trend we see continuing as we look ahead into Q4 and into next year.","Importantly, GDI revenue growth accelerated in Q3 given our launch activity in Europe and China, and we remain confident that we will see strong revenue growth for our 350 bar GDI technologies in 2020. As expected Power Electronics revenue declined by approximately 15% in the quarter, given the ongoing changes in government regulations and incentives in China.","While we expect this to result in continued choppiness in our quarterly performance, we anticipate Power Electronics returning to revenue growth in Q4 and beyond, driven by our technology leadership, commercial wins, and the increasing global shift towards electrified vehicles.","On the right hand side of the slide, you can see our regional revenue performance in Q3. Revenue in Europe declined by 6%, as growth in commercial vehicle and GDI was again offset by the ongoing decline in passenger car diesel revenues. Revenue in China declined by 15% as new 350 bar GDI launches were offset by overall market softness, as well as our own customer mix.","Finally, our sales in North American declined by 7%, driven by the ongoing OEM customer decisions to exit certain segments in the region and to a lesser extent by the GM strike.","Slide 11, walks through our operating income performance for Q3. Adjusted operating income was $71 million down from $108 million in the prior year quarter. This was primarily driven by unfavorable mix, primarily GDI versus passenger car diesel, lower industry production, particularly in China, as well as higher depreciation expense. This was partially offset by ongoing improvements in material and manufacturing performance planned lower engineering spend, as well as overall cost control. ","Turning to our segment performance on the next slide, on a year-on-year basis, Powertrain Systems adjusted revenue declined by 10% in the quarter as growth in GDI was more than offset by lower revenues in passenger car diesel in Europe and India. OEM decisions to exit certain segments in North America, lower Power Electronics revenues and to a lesser extent the GM strike. Adjusted operating margin of 5.5% was down primarily due to the fact as I've just described most notably unfavorable mix and lower overall global volumes, particularly in China.","Turning Aftermarket segment on slide 13, on a year-on-year basis, aftermarket revenues increased by 2% in Q3 as higher sales to independent aftermarket customers, more than offset planned lower OES revenues and to market softness in Europe. Adjusted operating margin of 10.3% increased by 290 basis points, primarily due to continued improvement in operational performances consistent with our focus on driving sustainable, profitable growth. This is partially offset by higher year-on-year tariff costs. ","Now let's move on to our updated outlook for 2019. Slide 14 highlights our revised outlook for the year. Relative to our prior outlook, the change is predominantly driven by the incremental industry and macro headwinds and the related impacts on our diesel revenues for both passenger car and commercial vehicles. In addition, we've also incorporated the impact of the GM strike through to the last week of October, which equates to approximately $20 million in revenue.","We now expect full year revenues to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.325 billion, which on an adjusted basis represents a 7.5% to 8% year-on-year decline. Compared to our prior outlook, this represents a 200 to 250 basis point reduction in growth, which is largely consistent with our lower global production assumption for the year. Approximately two thirds of this change in outlook is related to lower diesel revenue assumptions for passenger car and commercial vehicle.","Adjusted operating income margin is now expected to be between 7% and 7.2% with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 19%, or around one point higher. Our revised adjusted EPS range is $2.25 to $2.35. Operating cash flow is now expected to be between $235 million and $250 million, primarily due to the higher cash restructuring costs, which we now anticipate being between $60 million to $70 million.","We now see CapEx to be in the $350 million to $360 million range. The increase driven by an acceleration of our IT spend, as well as the completion of our new manufacturing sites, both of which will allow us to fully separate from our former parent and accelerate cost efficiencies in 2020.","Importantly, we see CapEx as a percentage of sales declining significantly next year. This is expected to be a key driver of our free cash flow improvement in 2020. And I'll come back to this in a couple of slides. In terms of some of the key assumptions for Q4, we estimate year-on-year global light vehicle production to decline by approximately 8%, with China declining by approximately 9%.","In addition, we expect commercial vehicle production to decline in the low-teens, driven by weakness in North America. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect to see Power Electronics return to year-on-year revenue growth driven by new launch activity.","Turning to slide 15, our prior adjusted operating margin outlook of approximately 8% for the full year implied a second half adjusted margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points compared to the first half. This assumed a combination of Delphi technologies initiatives, partially offset by market and macro headwinds. While the expected benefit from the Delphi Technologies specific initiatives are largely unchanged, the market and macro headwinds have increased, such as lower global production for both light and commercial vehicles, particularly in India, the GM strike as well as unfavorable FX dynamics.","In total, we now see approximately 200 basis points of additional market and macro headwinds in the second half of the year, predominantly in Q4. Given these market and industry wide challenges, and as Rick highlighted in his comments, we simply have to become a leaner and more flexible organization.","Through the execution of the restructuring plan we have announced today, I am confident that we are on the path to deliver both margin expansion and a significant improvement in our cash flow performance.","Slide 16 outlines the estimated cost and savings related to our three year plan, as well as the expected phasing over the period. At a high level, we are targeting more than $150 million of cost savings in 2022. This is expected to have an approximately $200 million of associated restructuring costs, with an average payback of little over one year. Of the total cost reduction we expect approximately 80% to come from engineering savings with a balanced split between SG&A and operations.","And as you can see on slide 16, we expect to achieve roughly one third of the savings in the first year or approximately $50 million in 2020. In addition, we expect to see a significant free cash flow improvement over the course of the plan, generating approximately $300 million of cash flow benefit through the end of 2023.","While we are not providing a specific 2020 outlook at this stage of the year, I want to share some directional color on slide 17 on how we see next year shaping up and some of the expected key driver. In terms of the trends and headwinds that are impacting us in the second half of the year of base case assumptions is that those trends continue into 2020 with an accelerated decline in commercial vehicles.","Starting with revenue, where our initial view is that both light and commercial vehicle production could decline next year. From the more Delphi Technologies perspective, we expect the trend in passenger diesel revenues to continue with the lower sales of our legacy power train products, offset by growth in GDI and Power Electronics and to a later extent by aftermarket.","Moving for adjusted operating margin, positive drivers include the benefits of restructuring, lower year-on-year spin related cost and the expected improvement in profitability for both GDI and Power Electronics. Offsetting this, we see the mix headwinds in our business accelerating, related to the shift from passenger car diesel revenues towards GDI and Power Electronics, as well as the expected cyclical downturn in commercial vehicles. ","Obviously a number of pluses and minuses to our revenue and profitability performance 2020, we see a clear path to a significant year-on-year improvements in free cash flow. Slide 18, highlights some of the cash flow tailwinds, importantly, they are all independent of revenue or are within areas that we control.","In total, we\u2019ve identified up to $200 million of free cash flow benefits in 2020, which are the combination of four drivers: first, CapEx which we see declining by $90 million to a $100 million relative to 2019. This reduction is a combination of the absence of approximately $40 million of spin rated CapEx as well as a returning underlying CapEx towards 5% of sales.","Second, the net benefit from incremental restructuring savings and costs. Third, we see a $35 million to $40 million year-on-year benefit, due to the absence of one-time separation cost incurred in 2019. Fourth, lower year-on-year pension cash contributions following the elevated levels of cash in 2019. In addition, and as Rick mentioned we see further opportunities to improve our working capital efficiency, through the implementation of lean initiatives focused on reducing our days on inventory on hand.","So, while we continue to expect uncertainty related to the volume and mix impacts on our cash flow performance in 2020, we see a very clear pathway to deliver higher year-on-year cash flow.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Your line is open.","John Murphy","Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the detail. Just as we think about the reduction in the engineering facilities 23 going down to 14 that\u2019s a big change and a lot folks going out. I'm just curious, Rick, as you look at this is there duplication in your efforts across facilities as they exist right now or will some work need to be ported to the remainder of the 14 facilities that stick around?","Rick Dauch","Great question, John. We do have some redundant capabilities at our sites. An example of this we have nine materials laboratories around the world, we don\u2019t need nine. So, we can move that work very quickly and move forward there. There are certain test equipment we have an example, we have over 80 dynos [ph] around the world, there\u2019s different size of dynos as I\u2019ve come to learn here so we can move some of the dyno work around.","Three, the downturn in the future development of ice engines is going to allow us to shutter down some of the dynos, and potentially sell them, because we\u2019re going to be doing some of the calibration work we\u2019ve done in the past. There will be some equipment we have to pick-up and move from sites that are being impacted and relocate them to open facilities and open floor space we have. So, I don\u2019t see a lot of CapEx in terms of building the additions et cetera. ","There\u2019s one area where we do handle gasoline where you have to have like bomb proof type facilities and we got to make some small adjustments into our facilities to do that. So, does that answer your question?","John Murphy","Yes, it does, I mean, I guess maybe simplistically this might be more prohibiting when you think about ER&D as a percent of sales. I mean what is the opportunity, sort of what is the best in class number that you think of and where you think you can ultimately get like just like forget about that dollar numbers you\u2019re talking about now? Percent of sales, what should we think about going forward?","Vivid Sehgal","Sure, John. Just actually, before that, I just want to sort of raise another point that Rick was touching upon, I think one of the important things that we have not factored in to our restructuring plans right now is any type of asset sale, that could actually allow also a very significant contribution to cash flow, and mitigate any type of requirements for moving CapEx or any other type of engineering [Technical Difficulty]. We sit on some pretty good sites at this point in time, and that will provide certain benefits as we move forward with that, but that's not in case within our current assumptions right now. ","But I think just overall, if I look at the engineering, what's clear is that we've already made some pretty good strides in this, if you look in the first half of this year, engineering was north of 9%. And even I think with Rick sort of focusing very hard right now on cost control, we\u2019re going to end the year in H2 closer to 8%. And sequentially, you can actually see that in Q3, we were down close to sort of $20 million less than in Q2. So we've already made some pretty good strides right now in terms of engineering.","So I think longer term we\u2019ll have to of course depend on revenue. But, I think, Rick called it out before, there's at least 200 basis points at a minimum of opportunity within engineering, which would largely drive our focus into the long-term closer to the 6% range. ","Rick Dauch","John, we\u2019ve taken a deep dive into the public powertrain companies, the drive train companies, the drive line companies, right. And the type of technology changes between as you move from the engine back to the drive train to the drive line, and so -- but we know where we stand versus our publicly traded powertrain competitors, we think we have an opportunity to get equal to or better than them in the next two years.","And we have a very clear plan, we've taken some extra time we've gone site-by-site, program-by-program, name-by-name, equipment-by-equipment, we now have a very clear plan, it's built over our four phases. Phase zero started already, as Vivid said in the third quarter, we're starting to see some results of Phase I, we're moving forward as of today. And Phase II and III, we're finalizing those and ready to go.","So this is -- we're going to run this just like we run a program, detailed month-by-month, site-by-site, name-by-name, who's going out the door who's moving to locations.","John Murphy","That's helpful. And then just the last question, I mean, you keep alluding to the aftermarket opportunity, obviously, this is a growth story as opposed to a cost rationalization story, although it might be both. What do you think you can ultimately do there and what are the key levers or drivers of aftermarket growth? And, how big could this be? I mean is it a very significant revenue opportunity?","Rick Dauch","Yes, let me -- I inherited when I got here, a plan called aftermarket 2020, which I vetted the first the 30 days with my predecessor and the team and it's a damn solid plan. We have some strong targets there to grow both the revenue and our profitability there. I think this has been an under focus asset for a long time. I think under our Delphi Technologies leadership, we're doing a better job. We have significant opportunities to grow globally. We have some pockets where we have some portfolio gaps so we can take a look at doing some things here to fill that.","And from an efficiency standpoint, Alex Ashmore and his team are doing a great job. One area that I've asked them to do is I think we do about 3.5 turns in aftermarket products right now and we think the benchmark is somewhere between five and 5.5. So we have too much inventory. And as we get after that you'll see even a better business for us in aftermarket. Back to Vivid.","Vivid Sehgal","Yes, and I think just touching on Rick's point, the aftermarket 2020 program was effectively a three year plan, which was to bring the focus on operating income margin and cash flow. I think the aftermarket team has done an extraordinary job in both of those, they've really turn this business into driving operating income margin, as well as a very strong cash contribution.","I think what you're going to see from the company as part of the 2020 plan is that comes through to 2020. We've always said that the aftermarket business can return to mid-single digit revenue growth. That's still a plan that I think we hold as a credible option for this company, it'll probably be through to the end of 2020 that they'll carry on focusing on the margin and the cash. But there's no reason right now, given especially the focus on the independent aftermarket business, this business segment that is doing well should return to that mid-single digit revenue growth.","John Murphy","That's very helpful. Thank you very much, guys. ","Rick Dauch","John, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joseph Spak","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for some of the color here, Rick and Vivid. I guess, I wanted to focus on the 2020 free cash flow and some of the walk you provided here. So you're guiding 2019, I'll use mid points here down about a burn of 110 you're saying about 190 call it under your control better. ","So that gets you to maybe plus 75. And then, I guess, we can make our own industry assumptions about what happens. I guess the missing piece should be working capital. And Rick, I heard you sort of talked about initiatives, especially on inventory, but how should we think about that in 2020, is that going to be harder to get at in a lower volume environment?","Rick Dauch","One thing we're taking a look at is not just dollars of inventory, but days on hand inventory. And we did some training at the end of the third quarter to -- on lean manufacturing systems. The interesting thing is a lot of that training have been done a decade ago. And inside the four walls of our factory we're pretty efficient. But we've expanded our look at the value stream outside of the four walls of our factory. And what we've discovered is almost incredible to me, as an industry veteran here, right?","I think we have over 41 days of inventory on hand right now. The majority of inventory is in the raw materials. We are now in the process of mapping from every single supplier to every warehouse we've identified that we didn't know about maybe before. And there's a significant opportunity to get after that right now, that doesn't take the industry downturn or upturn. We just got to get more efficient.","We have a couple sites where I've identified, our teams identify we bring parts into an outside warehouse, we offload it, we store it for a week or two weeks, then we take it to our own warehouse and we store for another week, and then we use it. That's just like as backwards. That kind of system left the industry about 25 years ago. So we've got to change the way we do business. We've restructured the organization that reports to me. I now have someone reporting me directly for purchasing, but also some reporting me on lean and logistics. And so we're going to get after that.","I also think part of our inventory issue is we also have a freight issue. We're averaging almost 4.6% of sales in freight and logistics, and that's also not benchmarked in the industry. So it's a target rich environment. It's one we've identified, our plants are pretty good shape, like I said, there's a few operating issues we get there and get better. And we got to get a better handle on our scheduling systems across our factories. ","I think we've inherited 67 different parts scheduling systems as we've migrated off the old Delphi Automotive Systems. And so we have to get after that as well down the road. ","Vivid Sehgal","And Joe, just let me add financially. I think your question is very prevalent. Because I think we're going to see some natural inventory improvements next year. And that's going to come from the fact that as we exit this year, we are holding some buffer stock at this stage. So there are two main buffer stocks that are in place. ","The first one is around as we come off the final contract manufacturing arrangement with our former parents at the end of Q1, we are holding additional inventory through the end of the year. And we are also holding at this stage some Brexit inventory with the uncertainty that is happening currently within the UK.","So there is going to be sort of to Rick's point of one to two day reduction in days on hand anyway. And I think, the whole organization is running at pace to implement the lean and it's a cultural shift for us right now. And it's being embedded pretty quickly.","Rick Dauch","And, Joe, my experience at Axle and Accuride and Acument is this kind of process now that we have the maps being done, we'll get after it. It takes a good 18 to 24 months to really see some significant improvement. But we have some low hanging fruit here we can get after quickly in 2020, for sure. ","But to really get a robust system where you go to runners, repeaters and strangers and you get rid of some of the dogs. And you put the right inventory, the right location, and have the right buffers, that takes some hard work and math to get that done. But it's something we're beefing up the team to do that right now.","Joseph Spak","Okay. So just to summarize, then. I mean, it sounds like based on what you feel confident, you can control, we're looking at a base of $75 million of free cash flow, and then we got to layer in maybe some benefit from working capital, and then whatever we think from the industry that those are the buckets to think about.","Rick Dauch","Yes, I mean, I'm not going to get into this sort of -- obviously, the macros are there. I mean, yes, I think you're absolutely right I think right now we have a lot of opportunities that are within our control that are related to current spin, and related to the fact that we're not going to be doing certain activities and coming off some of the buffer inventory. Yes. So you're right.","Joseph Spak","Okay. Just one housekeeping maybe I missed it. I didn't see a total bookings number in the quarter. I saw a year-to-date Power Electronics booking. Is that something you could disclose or are we seeing a slowdown in the\u2026","Rick Dauch","I think I mentioned it. We didn't put a slide in, but it's about $1 billion of bookings in the quarter.","Vivid Sehgal","It was in Rick's\u2026","Joseph Spak","Okay, sorry. I missed it. Thank you.","Rick Dauch","Great. Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris McNally from Evercore. Your line is open.","Chris McNally","Hey, guys and good morning. ","Rick Dauch","Good morning, Chris.","Chris McNally","I wanted to spend just a little time on the 2020 walk notes, it's early. And we can't give too much on a quantitative basis. But of two of the items that you highlighted in the graphic on I think 17 and 18. For the separation costs specifically, it's in the free cash flow walk. Will that also be a similar benefit in that kind of $35 million to $40 million range on a income statement basis between 2019 and 2020?","Vivid Sehgal","No, that's adjusted out, Chris. So it's a cash benefit, but not an adjust line number benefit, no. ","Chris McNally","But should we get anything in terms of the cost benefits that you've already done from a separation perspective on top of, obviously, the cost transformation that you highlighted right now that could be maybe $40 million to $45 million in 2020? ","Vivid Sehgal","Yes. So I think the element that we are certainly going to see an improvement on in 2020 is the absence of the spin costs, the TSA markups, the CMSA markups that we currently have. All of that will be coming through. I think the number it will not be at the level of $35 million or $40 million, but I think it's going to be a good uptick to ROI margins going forward. And we will provide that color on the Q4 call, but that will be a benefit into 2020.","Chris McNally","Okay, perfect. And then to the other side on the negative, I think the one area that surprised me was you highlight mix, does that mean China PATV could be a continued concern next year. What specifically were you calling out in terms of vehicle mix outside of light vehicle and commercial vehicle?","Vivid Sehgal","I think really, Chris the -- its commercial vehicle is the main sort of mix headwind right now. If you look at the sort of detrimental margins of the company, certainly some of our highest margin products at this stage are passenger car diesel and commercial vehicle. So obviously at this stage, we did call out that we see the commercial vehicle softening in 2020 and that will create for us some degree of mix impacts next year.","We see right now, our own estimate is that commercial vehicle from a global perspective will be sort of down mid-single digit with sort of North America being sort of 20% plus, Europe being sort of low-single digit, as well as China being mid-single digit at this stage. So I think the new news in terms of the mix of our business is basically CV at this stage, everything else is pretty much on track with where we thought it.","Chris McNally","Okay, that makes sense. And then one real quick one, just a high level in terms of the -- if we go to the top line and think about the inflection on content per vehicle it seems like forever ago when you laid out some of the positive drivers, because it's been, an issue from light vehicle production. But can you just talk about when we could really see that big inflection coming from Power Electronics. I mean, I think it was in the 2020 timeframe as it gets going about $500 million, but it really is doesn't -- a lot of your programs are 2022 and beyond. So could you just give a timeframe for where this, your couple points of content per vehicle become something much greater? ","Rick Dauch","Chris, this is Rick. Two things, I think there's one program that was supposed to launch this year with one of our Asian OEMs, and it's been delayed until next year. So I think we'll see a jump in that. We did see some orders come in, in the 15-week releases that are going to show some bills in fourth quarter. So that gives us some confidence. So that's one big step up.","And the next big step us is some of the programs we won out into 2022 we launch. And we do a lot of pilot -- do a lot of engineering and testing in 2020 and we do some pilot in 2021. You'll start seeing production in the back half of 2021 and 2022.","Vivid Sehgal","Yes, we certainly will. I think to Rick's point, I think what you're going to see or we expect at this stage is to see a return to material growth in Power Electronics in 2021. I think certainly what happened in China given the NEV credit situation and the mix shift of CN5 to CN6 definitely impacted our Power Electronics performance this year. But right now most of that inventory adjustment and noises is beginning to disperse.","And I think what's really good news for us is that our launch profile starts moving towards the full BEV not just the PHEV, which most of our platforms are on today. So I think Chris, what you're going to see from us is an expectation of some pretty material growth in Power Electronics starting in 2020.","Rick Dauch","And Chris, this has took me a while to understand how all the systems work here at Delphi Technologies from a product standpoint, but we talk about the downturn in light duty diesel, that's not just in the fuel injectors that's in the controllers that go on those light duty diesel vehicles as well that was something that it's kind of a double whammy for us both on our fuel injection system business and our electronics business. So that loss stabilizes as we get through the transition and we'll start launching more.","So GDI is going to pick up significant next year we've got a couple tranches of new capacity going in, we have two additional launches for new OEM customers. So we're really busy on the GDI side that will help us get across that fixed cost structure that we have put in place the last two years.","And then Power Electronics where the guys are working feverishly to get things qualified equipments are now in place we're going to slow down our capital spend at some of our sites. When I first got here, people are talking about we're going to be out of capacity. Hey, hold on a second let's fill up the capacity and floor space we have first and then we'll talk about future down the road. So I think we get to first some of the capital that was in our original plan out a couple years to 2025, 2026.","Chris McNally","Helpful detail. Much appreciated. ","Rick Dauch","Great, Chris. Thanks. Good questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Emmanuel Rosner","Good morning. ","Rick Dauch","Good morning.","Vivid Sehgal","Hey, Emmanuel.","Emmanuel Rosner","First question on the transformation plan. I'm a little bit surprised that it takes three years to sort of create some of the savings here. To the extent a decent chunk of them come from headcount reduction, where usually the savings basically happen as soon as the headcount reduction is sort of realized. Is the fact that it's in a staggered over three years and with just one sort of it coming next year is that sort of out of a focus on trying to preserve cash or like figuring out that you don't want to fund all the costs in one year or is there any particular operational impediment to making this savings happen faster?","Rick Dauch","Good question. So, as you know, we support -- our revenue base is very diverse. We have no customers more than 10% of our sales. So that also means we have a bunch of programs that are being designed, developed and tested for a bunch of customers. And one of the reason we took a little longer to go forward on our restructuring plan, as got to go through every single program, we're working with a customer, whether it's currently in a calibration stage or we got to finish the contract we have until it finishes, or in the development test stage where we'll launch in 2021, 2022, 2023.","So we have over 160 different programs that are tied to specific customers across these 23 sites. So we got to make sure we hand these programs off either finish them at a site before it closes, or hand it off from one site to another without dropping the ball.","So we will move as fast and as aggressive as we can. Our Board gave us very clear direction to do that. We feel comfortable to what we have right now and after our last board meeting, we're going back to see if we can pull ahead some of those restructuring.","Vivid Sehgal","And I think, Emmanuel, following on from that I think the other area look, I think from our perspective, I think close to a one year payback is a good return given everything that's going on. I would also highlight on Rick mentioned in his prepared remarks that much of the work we're doing is in Western Europe.","Now, what's really important is that this is a fundamentally important move from the company, given our footprint and looking for best cost locations. Now we're going to do everything in the right way. We're going to do it with speed. But obviously working in Western Europe has its own issues that we will deal with. And we have a very clear pathway how to get these restructuring activities done efficiently, quickly. ","But when you're dealing with certain countries, you have to fall in line with the regulations that are underway. And we have a very clear plan of how we're going to do that and we're very confident that we'll get through them very fast.","Rick Dauch","Emmanuel before we had this call today over in Europe, our team met with the European Works Councils that represent the workers at our tech centers. There's follow up site council meetings this week, and so we'll go through and work through those, here in North America you go a little faster, in Mexico, and United States and South America and in Asia, but in Europe we got to work through. The fact that we\u2019re going to be able to close nine tech centers, lay-off 1,500 people and have just slightly over a year payback is pretty incredible. If we can do better, we\u2019ll execute it.","Emmanuel Rosner","Understood. And regarding the puts and takes for the 2020 operating margin on slide 17, I wanted to see if you can help us a little bit more on the mix headwinds, which I feel have the potential just roughly material? Is there any sort of lump-sum you can give on what sort of decremental margin you could experience when you see decline in the commercial vehicle business and or the light vehicle diesel business obviously not all your businesses are starting from the same point? So anything that if we make our own assumptions around the magnitude of the top line decline, what sort of like decremental impact does it have on margin?","Vivid Sehgal","Yes, I think what we\u2019ve said in the past Emanuel, and still holds true today. I think the decremental margins of the company are in that sort of 30% range, and if you look at CV and passenger car diesel, you\u2019re looking more in the 30% to 35% range in terms of decrementals. Obviously, as we go forward I did call out that we see the CV market in this state on a global production level, being closer to mid-single digit decline. ","So obviously, that will have a mix headwind opportunity, however, to be very clear we also have a series of very good opportunities in terms of margin expansion. We have the restructuring plan in place, we\u2019ve been very clear and Rick\u2019s been clear that GDI and Power Electronics are well on their way to the growth potential and margin that we expect them to be and to get to breakeven. And again aftermarket, you\u2019ve just seen today again another 290 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. And the team is doing an outstanding job in driving margin expansion.","So, CV will be a headwind and we\u2019ve called that out, but I also want to focus very hard on the margin expansion opportunities that we also have in this business.","Rick Dauch","Yes, I\u2019d say we\u2019re not happy that we have degradation margins of 30% to 40% that\u2019s unacceptable quite honestly. We should be no more than 20%-25% so we have to address some of the overhead cost structure, we got to move a little quicker when the downturns come. Our guys have that message and hope that they learn. Lot of intent here, grow the business, put the plans in and guess what the market turn in our face, electronics is not coming as fast as we thought, GDI is a tougher launch than we thought. So we got some work to do, the guys understand that.","So we understand when I say we have some internal operating issues, we understand where they\u2019re at now. We\u2019re going to address them, we had to fix them quickly, we got to fix them suppliers and so we\u2019ll get after that quickly.","Emmanuel Rosner","Understood, thanks for the color. ","Rick Dauch","Great, thanks.","Vivid Sehgal","Thanks, Emmanuel.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Levy from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Dan Levy ","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I want to just touch on bookings, you mentioned it was $1 billion in the quarter. So, if I'm correct you guys have call it, like $6.5 billion in bookings year-to-date through 3Q and fully recognized that bookings are very lumpy, but to be flat with the $9 billion of bookings you put up in 2018, you did something like $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, which really is a lot based on what you\u2019ve done in prior quarters.","So, as we\u2019re sort of nearing the end of 2019, how do we interpret what demand that being a lower year, year-over-year for booking. Is it just simply, that it\u2019s lumpy and we shouldn\u2019t read too much into it? Or is there some indication that at the moment, commercially maybe you\u2019re a little less focused on securing new business and rather really the focus right now, the key priority is just trying to support the business that you currently have secured?","Rick Dauch","We haven\u2019t given up on our targets for 2019, we\u2019re still in negotiations on some fairly large programs, both on U.S. and in Europe right now and in Asia. We\u2019re going to take profitable business. When we got this business, there\u2019s a few things that we\u2019re taking part, even when I joined the company where we took some business that now we\u2019re going back and fix whether that\u2019s with price increases or we have to reduce some prices from our suppliers.","So we have a very clear return on invested capital targets, profitability targets for this business. We aren't going to take business that doesn't make money doesn't do you any good. You spend a hell of a lot of money on engineering and tooling that you'll make money, you have a six or seven year payback. That doesn't make sense for us. So let's see how the fourth quarter shakes out, how's that?","We're 100% focused -- I'm 100% focused on growing the business. But growing it in a profitable way. And we've also trying to put some discipline in this company that we have to get these commercial negotiations done in a way where you give the engineering team and the manufacturing supply chain teams the opportunity to execute those programs successfully. ","You don't take them at the very last minute and then you don't have time to get your equipment installed and launch and then you get into a disastrous launch. And we've been fighting through some of those the last couple years.","Vivid Sehgal","Yeah, I would also just add, Dan, that I think the focus of the business on Power Electronics, GDI. You saw last quarter a $2.7 billion win our largest ever win in terms of Delphi Technologies, but obviously given what we're talking about in commercial vehicle right now, should we expect to see some lumpiness within the CV business that has been a very strong bookings for us in the past? The answer is yes, given where we are in the cycle at this stage.","However, that doesn't mean we're not going after business. And we've got some great sort of opportunities ahead, but there is going to be some CV softness as we go into 2020. But that's not unusual. And we don't think that's any type of concern because Power Electronics, we have some very large wins already banked on we're going after some pretty big wins going into next year.","Rick Dauch","I\u2019ll make a little bit -- few more comments. We're gaining market share on GDI and we're gaining market share that's profitable. We are winning our more than our fair share of the electronic side of the house because of our advanced technologies on Viper Technologies and how we can fit a smaller controller into the into the engine side.","On the powertrain product side of the house, which is our non-fuel injection system business, I think that was an area that we probably didn't focus on enough. We've got the sales team now going after big targets there, we have small capacity. And on the aftermarket side, I think there are certain regions of the world where we're under represented. So we're going in four different ways to grow the business as well.","Dan Levy ","Great. And then just to just to be clear, the transformation plan that you've unveiled this morning this has -- this is not in any way a comment on what your future sort of commercial endeavors maybe? This is purely we should just interpret this as your push to be more efficient with what you have in that the commercial push is still unchanged. Is that correct? ","Rick Dauch","That's exactly right. I'll give you an example. I have four sites in the world that work on ignition. Ignition business is around $200 million business for us. I don't need for engineering sites working on ignition, maybe one or two. We don't need nine materials labs, we just have a legacy structure that grew up under two previous owners that needs to be addressed and resized.","Vivid Sehgal","Yes, and the focus really down at the moment is if two thirds of the engineering will be in legacy programs, including passenger car diesel, in some of the legacy ATP programs [ph]. If you actually look at the engineering that we have in Power Electronics, it's very little touch there in terms of change. And I think what you're going to see from us, and we call this out a number of times, it will actually allow us to have the optionality of further investments in advanced technologies.","So I actually believe that what we're doing is freeing up cash flow in legacy areas of the businesses to actually give us some optionality to actually invest more and be selective in what we do. So we look at that as very positive trend within our investment profile.","Dan Levy ","Great, thank you very much. ","Rick Dauch","Good question.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Noah Kaye","Thanks. So first, just to level set with all of this discussion around detrimental. Is this -- am I reading the slide right that your initial bias for next year is towards flattish operating margins?","Vivid Sehgal","What we're saying is that we are really subject to the market at this point in time. So we clearly see the opportunities of margin expansion opportunity within our business that includes the restructuring the absence of spin costs, and an improvement within the GDI and Power Electronics profitability. Obviously, this year, the market going backwards and we're now calling it 7% down on a global basis. Much of our margin profile will be subject to how volumes in light vehicle and commercial vehicle actually trend out into Q4 and next year. What we are calling out is that we have margin expansion opportunities.","Noah Kaye","Understood. I mean, I think, you've given us some idea that you're initially thinking about mid-single digits CV declines next year, continued LTP softness. So I guess just to clarify, is this sort of -- is this slide contemplating the order of magnitude in when you talked about the mix headwinds. In other words, is this -- is that what you're sort of baking into your initial outlook?","Vivid Sehgal","No, we're not giving outlook right now I think in Q4, we will provide much deeper color I think we want to get through the Brexit issues, we want to understand Q4 of where we actually end up what we are saying is that we have a number of opportunities given the mix headwinds that we see within commercial vehicle to offset that, and the restructuring should actually provide us with optionality to try in the longer term to grow.","But I'm -- we're going to provide very clear color in terms of 2020. What we are saying is we got some very controlled and good opportunities to expand margin next year, we are going to wait for the macros to find out where they actually go.","Noah Kaye","Understood, and that's very helpful. I guess just around the comments for expectation for more bookings and growth in Power Electronics, it really looks like you're pulling a lot of technology levers here to support a more robust Power Electronics architecture. You have the CREE partnership announcement, the Poly Charge investment, I guess, just to understand how quickly do you see your customers\u2019 needs evolving with respect to Power Electronics?","And I guess in light of this transformational plan and the investments you've made in standing up your PE capacity, just what kind of flexibility do you see that you have to do incremental product engineering, any changes to product launches and just kind of keep pushing down the technology curve.","Rick Dauch","Those are great questions. First of all, I'd say that the technology changes and demands happen almost every single day. There has been big bets by some of the largest OEMs in the world on electrification, they don't have the experience inside their own company to do some of the work. And so they've taken us in as partners. I think this one OEM we worked for over two years, where they funded our engineering to help them get both the hardware in terms of the technology and the systems that control that technology across a very complex infrastructure of that vehicle. So that's number one.","And we have a legacy of over three decades of being electronic leaders back to the GM original volt and stuff like that or E1, I think it was called. The fact that we've won electronics business with some of the largest OEMs in China, the OEMs in Europe is really critical for us and we got there.","Second, I think we have asked our team to take a look at what we installed at each one of our five E&E sites around the world, does it make sense to be 100% integrator do we should move some of that work out to reduce our capital, is there any capital that\u2019s only running one shift right now or only two shifts, and I can defer some of that capital or move it to a new location where we have to put in a capital. So some very fluid situation is what I\u2019d tell you.","Vivid Sehgal","And think Noah just, I mean, the one -- there can be no doubt and I don't think that anybody thinks any other way. I mean, electrification is going to get more important in every region of the world, whether you're looking at China right now. If you're looking at Europe, North America as we move towards the next range of regulatory targets that come out, for example, 2025 in Europe. We actually believe that high voltage solutions are going to be the way forward that the majority of our customers today are going to hit those CO2 and regulatory targets. I don\u2019t think they have a choice in the matter.","And I think what we're really looking at right now is obviously the pace of that change. But as I said, we think that we're going to return to some pretty decent growth on Power Electronics in 2020. We're moving towards the BV platforms as on the high voltage basis. So we have not changed our strategy on Power Electronics whatsoever. We see ourselves as a market leader on that we see the market in every region evolving towards that. And we think we're going to be a key player and actually the pathway to electrification.","Rick Dauch","So one thing I understand when I\u2019m here now, is that we have 10 plants inside the Delphi system out of our 24 sites that are in some kind of launch mode, or resizing mode. We have three brand new greenfield or brownfield sites in E&E that were built since the time we spun and we're going through qualifications with multiple customers. Our Blonie plant right now is hosting one or two customers a week to get certified to get the approved to become a supplier because that work still gets done for us adaptive. And so that'll be done by first quarter.","It's easier to put that on a PowerPoint to actually have the people prepared to have the customers come in and do all the audits, line by line machine by machine takes a lot of work. And I give the team in Blonie great credit for getting their plan built on time, equipment installed. We've gone from zero people when I got here to over 200 people in that plant now making parts so we can in source that work. Hell of a job by John Lipinski and his team there.","So we have six GDI sites around the world, two in China very stable, two in Eastern Europe that are still going through the last parts of their launch bugs and one in Western Europe. And we're launching a new site next year in Mexico. Six plants, putting the brand new technology, brand new equipment, brand new designs, and it's going to last us for 20 years. We got to go through the growing pains there.","And then we're in the process of consolidating one of our UK plants and moving that equipment to three different locations in the world. So we still got about 12 to 18 months to getting that. The fundamental operations of this company stabilized, while we were executing a spin and putting a new IT system. So there's a lot of work going on here. And we have much better days ahead of us here at Delphi Technologies.","Noah Kaye","All right, that's very helpful color. Thanks very much. ","Rick Dauch","All right, great.","Operator","I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Rick Dauch.","Rick Dauch","Well, I appreciate everyone joining the call. I know it's a busy day for all you analysts out there with a lot of announcements and some of the big news in the industry between OEMs consolidating or tier ones in Japan consolidating. So we appreciate your interest in Delphi Technologies. We'll see you on the road. Thanks. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect."],"7277":["Delphi Technologies PLC (NYSE:DLPH) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call August  1, 2019  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Sherief Bakr - Vice President, IR","Rick Dauch - CEO","Vivid Sehgal - CFO","Conference Call Participants","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs","Brian Johnson - Barclays","Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank","Operator","Good morning. My name is Jarenda and I'll be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Delphi Technologies' Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being accorded and simultaneously webcast.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sherief Bakr, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sherief, please go ahead.","Sherief Bakr","Thank you, Jarenda, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone. Welcome to Delphi Technologies' second quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today in London is our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Dauch; and our Chief Financial Officer, Vivid Sehgal.","This call will include a discussion of our second quarter 2019 financial results as disclosed in today's press release as well as updated outlook for our 2019. In order to follow along with today's presentation, you can find an accompanying set of slides on our Investor Relations website at ir.delphi.com.","Please note that our discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to their corresponding GAAP measures in the tables within our press release. In addition, references to changes in revenue are on adjusted basis excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements.","Now, before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q as well as other filings with the SEC. I'd encourage all of you to review these risk factors listed in these documents.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Dauch","Thank you, Sherief, and good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. ","Since January 7th, my primary focus has been on visiting our operating sites around the world need with our people, our customers, suppliers and business partners to assess both our strengths and our weaknesses and to identify areas where we need to move quickly to improve our execution and efficiency, which is increasingly important in the weaker global production environment we find ourselves in today.","My leadership team and I now have a clear idea of the material opportunities and the actions required to reshape and refocus Delphi Technologies into a leaner, more cost-effective organization in a far more profitable business. ","My initial assessment was I shared with you earlier in the year were correct. We have game-changing product technologies that sit at the heart and crossroads of the propulsion revolution. ","Our customers value, our product portfolio, and our global footprint. And we are winning more than our fair share of new business due to our technical prowess. But the clear feedback from our business partners, both suppliers and customers, and from our own associates is that we can do better. And that we have numerous opportunities to improve our operational and financial performance. ","We have an overly complex and cost the organizational structure underpinned by legacy IT systems that are suboptimal, there are clear opportunities to take out excess costs and drive efficiency in almost all areas of our business.","Across our operating footprint, supply chain and back office areas. We have elements of lean, but they are not systematically embedded in our company or our culture. We are not a lean company, and this will change. For Delphi Technologies delivering on our mission to make vehicles drive cleaner, better and further provides tremendous long-term opportunities for us and all of our stakeholders.","Turning to our second quarter performance on slide two. At a macro level, our 5% year on year revenue decline was more than 2% better than the overall market. Relative to the outlook we've had last quarter. Adjusted operating margin of 7.2% was negatively impacted by lower volumes, as well as incremental FX and tariff headwinds.","Despite this operating cash flow was a relatively strong $70 million and will remain highly focused on continue to improve our cash flow performance in the second half of the year and beyond. We continue to pursue numerous growth opportunities and key technologies and I was especially pleased that we secured our largest ever commercial win as a company in the quarter for our Power Electronics business. This clearly underscores the technical leadership capabilities of Delphi Technologies in the area of electrification.","Moving to slide three. On last quarter's call, I mentioned that we expected some market choppiness related to a number of industry-wide transitions and macro impacts to continue over the coming quarters. These include the transition from passenger car diesel, the gasoline engines to specially here in Europe. ","The projected growth and timing electrification, mostly in China and Europe, as well as the ongoing trade and tariff dynamics all the way across the globe.","In addition, we have also seen the dollar strengthened against most major world currencies. At a high level, we now expect global production to decline by approximately 5% in 2019. This is an update to our prior view of an approximate 2% decline. ","This is primarily being driven by weaker industry trends in China, where we now expect full year productions declined by approximately 12% in 2019, around 4% worse than our prior view.","Turning to Europe, we now expect full year production in Europe to decline by approximately 3% or 1%, lower than our prior view, primarily due to uncertainty related to Brexit, and revised GDP forecasts.","Finally, turning to North America, light vehicle sire is relatively stable. With an ongoing shift away from sedans and traditional passenger cars. We do expect to see some softening in that area and commercial vehicles in the second half of the year and into 2020 given recent heavy-duty truck order trends. ","So, on the one hand is clear that we are navigating through some significant shorter-term industry and macro headwinds, but it's also clear that the long term second the growth drivers of our business remain intact.","Whether it is the pursuit activities, we are engaging with customers, or the public statements you are hearing from OEMs across the globe, the long-term structural shift to more efficient powertrains is accelerating. ","This represents a tremendous content for vehicle and revenue growth opportunity for us here. ","Turning the slide four, which highlights some of the operational progress we made during Q2. My orientation as a new CEO is basically complete and I have taken a much more hands on leadership role here at Delphi Technologies. ","Let me give you a few areas of achievement in Q2. We continue to be on track to exit our key transitional service and contract manufacturing service agreements. I have met with most of our top 12 customers around the world to fully understand how they view us as a partner, and to identify areas where we can properly grow and when together. They highlighted many of our strengths, and some are opportunities to improve as a company. We have done a deep analysis of our legacy overhead cost structure and footprint. This is a target rich opportunity for us to meaningfully improve our overall profitability.","As you know, we have a number of important product revenue transitions underway within our overall business mix. and improving the probability for GDI is a key priority for us. I am pleased with the progress our team has made over the last two quarters and we continue to expect to achieve breakeven probability for GDI by the end of 2020. ","Our three new electric plants are now built, and they are in qualification launch mode, we expect to be 100% self-sufficient in terms of Power Electronics production and supply at the end of Q1 2020.","We will be well-positioned to selectively make adjustments and flexible capacity in line with the industry's moves electrified vehicles in each region, which will improve our CapEx efficiency going forward. ","We have initiated our lean systems journey across our supply chain and operating sites will be using a proven system and based on my personal assessments, we can significantly improve our cash flow conversion cycle. We've also realigned and reshape your organization to simplify our cost structure, and to drive greater speed and bottom-line accountability across the company.","Turning to slide five, which outlines our updated vision and mission. We have established a new mission, a new vision for our company, and it's pretty straightforward to be the pioneers in propulsion technologies solutions and services. ","Leadership in Propulsion Systems Technology is the absolute heart of our company, and something our customers highly value. Being first to market gives us a competitive advantage by providing technological breakthroughs and solutions that help our customers meet the increasingly stringent global and regional standards for fuel efficiency and emissions.","Our new vision gives us a well-defined and clear focus on the areas we will invest into support our long-term profitable growth. At the same time, it allows us to identify those areas where we will minimize investments in legacy or non-core products and locations. ","What does it mean to be a pioneer propulsion technologies? Let's start by talking about our significant commercial wins in the second quarter. Let's move to slide six. ","We had another tremendous quarter of gross bookings in Q2, securing 3.8 billion of lifetime revenues across our internal combustion engine and electronic portfolios. Our major ward of the quarter, our largest ever commercial win is where I want to spend a little bit of time. ","This win with a leading global premium OEM is a result of almost two years of collaborative pre-development work involving hundreds of engineers from both Delphi Technologies and the customer, as well as a key supplier resulted in us being the first to market with our high volume 800-volt silicon carbide inverter. ","Throughout the process, our industry leading technologies, including our patented Viper power switch, coupled with our deep understanding of Powertrain Systems and software set us apart from our competitors. This is what it was what being a pioneer propulsion technology means. I would like to congratulate the entire Delphi Technologies team on bringing this one home a huge breakthrough wins for our company.","Let's turn to Slide seven. We are not only winning in the area of electronics; we continue to win new business and expand our product portfolio as well. As I mentioned earlier, the shift from light duty decently that diesel to gasoline systems is real, and is accelerating in pace, especially here in Europe. ","We first launched our GDI 200 bar systems in 2012 over in China. Today we have 5 plants and Europe and Asia making either 200 or 350 bar GDI injectors, pumps and rails. We will add a 6 plant in 2020, in North America.","In May at the Vienna Powertrain Systems Symposium, we introduced our next generation design, a 500-bar system, the first in the industry to do so. We are now working closely with multiple OEMs in the labs to validate designs on their current engines. ","Importantly, the future shifts the 500 Bar GDI will significantly lower our future CapEx requirements and meaningfully improve our cash flow generation potential as we believe there is a high level of CapEx reuse for our currently installed 350 bar manufacturing systems and capacity. ","There is another clear example that Delphi Technologies team being true pioneers in propulsion in both product and process technology leadership.","Let me switch gears and provide a bit of insight into areas where we need to move quickly to improve our performance. Let's move to slide eight. ","Last quarter, I showed you my early assessment of our overall strengths and weaknesses based on my first 90 days in the company. That assessment has not changed. In fact, what I've seen over the past 90 days, only reinforces my earlier findings. ","We must move aggressively to address our lack of common processes and an uncompetitive legacy overhead cost structure. To do so, we have added several new executive leaders to address specific areas of needs. ","First, I'd like to thank Mary Gustanski, who is stepping down from the company at the end of the year as part of a planned succession. Mary has played an integral role at this company for over more than 39 years, most recently leading our advanced engineering teams. I would like to personally thank her for her support during my tenure as CEO and for her leadership role as Delphi Technologies was recently spun off.","To improve our manufacturing quality and program management and launch systems we have brought in Michael Dora and David Culton, who have worked with me previously in similar roles. ","At our commercial vehicle business, which is critically important to us, and based on my visits to multiple sites have been a bit ignored and underlapped over the past few years. We have hired Todd Anderson, a proven P&L leader from the commercial vehicle industry to step in and take over the leadership of these critical assets. ","Dean Harlow just joined our company last week, and will be working closely with me and the business leaders to rationalize our global engineering footprint, which is unwieldy and was never fully integrated after the acquisition of Lucas, TRW powertrain business back in 1999. ","While we have moved to rationalize the manufacturing footprint, closing five plants across our three regions over the years, the redundant technical centers, material labs and testing facilities around the world were not adequately addressed. That will change.","Slide nine. Over the past four months, we have taken a deep dive into our overhead cost structure. As you can see, on slide nine, we have a tremendous opportunity to improve our cost structure in the combined areas of R&D and SG&A without negatively impacting our long-term growth potential. ","Today, we have 25 engineering sites around the world. With few exceptions, our average utilization of key testing and lab equipment is less than 50%. That is simply mindboggling to me as a long-term automotive industry executive. ","We are finalizing a plan to rationalize this footprint in a cost-effective manner without disrupting more than 160 ongoing new product development and customer launch programs that will launch in 2020, 2023. We aim to finalize and announce these plans in the third quarter of 2019.","In addition, now that we are closed to finishing our spin related task, we are taking a hard look at our overall SG&A costs. This is another area of opportunity for structural cost improvement. And the start, we will move to reduce approximately 200 positions by year end. We're also in the process of better understanding the underlying IT systems and networks that underpin our company.","We are developing a plan to significantly revamp this critical area of the company, which will allow us to further reduce SG&A costs. We expect to finalize these plans by the end of the year.","Before I turn the call over to Vivid, I wanted to conclude by updating you on what our business priorities are over the next two quarters.","Slide 10 lays out our immediate priorities, many of which are consistent with the last quarter. First, we remain laser focused on delivering improve underlying profitability in the second half of the year and meeting our overall 2019 objectives. This includes ensuring we complete our full transition to a standalone company. Completing this transition will give us the opportunity to lower costs.","Second, continue to improve GDI profitability through operational improvements and flawless execution of future capacity investments. We have made good progress in this area, and we continue to expect to get to breakeven profitability by the end of 2020.","Third, balance of pace of investments, in Power Electronics, between shorter term headwinds and the undoubted longer-term opportunities. While we remain focused on profitably scaling our Power Electronics business to breakeven beyond three plants in 2019, we must also acknowledge or respond to the choppier market growth patterns we are experiencing","Fourth, continuing to build in the great work our leadership team has done to improve the profitability and position our master market business for accelerated global growth.","Fifth, expedite our journey to become truly world class lean practitioners. We will follow a proven multi-step process over the next two or three years that will drive meaningful improvements in our cash conversion cycle. And finally, we need to complete the work that is well underway to define our medium-term financial framework and value creation opportunity.","Given the greater short term -- shorter term industry and macro headwinds and uncertainties, most notably in China and in Power Electronics, we have determined that we need to further evaluate our initial assumptions and scenarios, including our second half performance and trends we expect heading into 2020.","Let there be no doubt, we are focused on delivering margin expansion and higher levels of free cash flow over the long-term, which we believe provides a compelling value creation opportunity. I continue to be excited about the opportunities and intensely motivate to lead Delphi Technologies on a journey from being a good company into being a true industry leader and a great company.","Our journey to become pioneers in propulsion, technology is well underway. Our leadership teams around the world understand that we have established a clear vision for our company, and that the standards of excellence have been raised significantly upon my arrival.","As I said earlier, my CEO orientation period is over, and we are now in full take action mode to deliver on the tremendous long-term potential of Delphi Technologies.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Vivid.","Vivid Sehgal","Thank you, Rick. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. ","My remarks will focus on our Q2 performance, our revised full year outlook which largely reflects incremental industry and macro headwinds, as well as providing additional commentary on how we now see our phasing in the second half of the year and the drivers of our expected sequential margin improvement compared to the first half of 2019.","Looking at our Q2 performance in more detail on slide 11, revenue of $1.12 billion in the quarter declined by 5.1% year-on-year, with more than a 2% favorable to the overall market decline, more than 7%. ","Our Q2 revenue performance was driven by mid-single digit year-on-year growth in commercial vehicle and GDI as well as our growth in our aftermarket business which was more than offset by lower sales, in China and lower passenger car diesel revenues in Europe.","In addition, we saw a revenue decline in our Power Electronics business primarily in China, due to the transition from China V to VI changes in NEV subsidies and the overall market decline of close to 20%. I\u2019ll come back on this in my later remarks.","Adjusted operating income of $81 million, or 7.2% margin declined year-on-year and came in slightly below our prior outlook. As unfavorable product mix, lower production, foreign exchange, higher engineering and unfavorable tariff dynamics more than offset ongoing cost actions and other operational initiatives.","Adjusted EPS of $0.58 also reflected a higher than expected tax rate in the quarter. Consistent with our focus on costs, and cash flow in a softer growth environment, I was pleased with our operating cash flow performance, generating $70 million in the quarter supported by ongoing working capital initiatives.","Finally, CapEx of $103 million in the quarter is consistent with our front end loaded phasing for the year given the strong current and future demand we see for GDI and Power Electronics, as well as the expected higher one-time CapEx related to the separation from our former parent. As we build three plants for electrification business and establish our own IT infrastructure set up. Our full year CapEx outlook is essentially unchanged.","Turning to slide 12, which provides more detail on our revenue progression in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier year-on-year global industry production declined by more than 7% in Q2, approximately twice the rate of decline assumed three months ago. Partially offsetting this, we saw strong momentum in a number of areas of the portfolio, most notably in our latest generation of 350 bar GDI systems, the passenger cars, as well as in commercial vehicles.","Our Power Electronics performance in Q2 was impacted by the changes in government regulations in China, which drove some shorter-term shifts in the mix between internal combustion engines, plug in hybrid and full battery electric vehicles. This resulted in both a slower than expected ramp of some of our Power Electronics launches in the first half of the year as well as more conservative volume expectations for the balance of this year.","We expect Power Electronics revenues to return to year-on-year growth in the second half of 2019, including a number of new launches. ","Looking further ahead, we continue to expect strong revenue growth in Power Electronics driven by our technology leadership, commercial winds and the increasing global shift towards electrified vehicles. ","GDI revenues came in slightly ahead of our expectations increasing by approximately 5% year-on-year, primarily driven by launches related to our 350 bar GDI products, which we expect to continue into the second half of the year.","As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide from a total company perspective, we outgrew the market in all regions with the exceptions of North America. Revenue in Europe was approximately flat year-on-year as growth in commercial vehicle and GDI was again offset by the ongoing decline in passenger car diesel revenues. ","Revenue in China declined by 14% year-on-year as new 350 bar GDI launches will offset by overall market softness, as well as our own customer mix. Finally, our sales in North America declined by 10%, driven by OEM customer decisions to exit certain segments in the region, which more than offset continued growth in commercial vehicle.","Slide 13 walks through our operating income performance for Q2. Adjusted operating income was $81 million, down from $156 million in the prior year quarter. This is primarily driven by unfavorable mix, lower industry production particularly in China and favorable FX dynamics, higher engineering spends primarily due to our investments in electrification, high depreciation expenses, as well as high commodity and tariff related costs. This is partially offset by ongoing improvement in material and manufacturing performance, as well as overall cost control.","Turning to our segment performance of the next slide. On a year-on-year basis, Powertrain Systems adjusted revenue declined by 7% in the quarter as growth in commercial vehicle and GDI was more than offset by lower revenues from the roll-offs in passenger car diesel in Europe, OEM customer decision to exit certain programs in North America and to a lesser extent, lower Power Electronics revenue. ","Adjusted operating margin of 6.6% was down primarily due to the factors as I've just described. Most notably unfavorable mix primarily related to the ongoing transitions away from higher margin passenger car diesel in Europe, and lower overall global volumes, particularly in China and North America. ","In the near-term, and as Rick referenced ensuring we execute on our initiatives to improve GDI and Power Electronics profitability remains a key priority.","Turning to our aftermarket segment on slide 15. On a year-on-year basis, our aftermarket business, returned to growth in Q2. As highest sales to independent aftermarket customers more than offset lower OES revenues. Adjusted operating margin of 7.9% declined, primarily due to unfavorable mix relative to the prior year quarter higher year-on-year tariff costs, partially offset by the continued improvements in operational performance consistent with a focus on driving sustainable, profitable growth.","Now let's move on to our updated outlook the 2019. Slide 16 highlights our revised outlook for the year. Relative to our prior outlook, the change is predominantly driven by incremental industry and macro headwinds. Importantly, we continue to expect to achieve improvements in our profitability in the second half of the year. And I'll come back to this in a couple of slides.","Starting with revenue, we now expect full year revenues to be in the range of $4.425 billion to $4.475 billion, which an adjusted basis represents a 5% to 6% year-on-year decline. Adjusted operating income margin is now expected to be approximately 8%, resulting in an adjusted EPS range of $2.65 to $2.85.","Consistent with our ongoing focus on cost control in a softer growth environment, we are accelerating our restructuring initiative in the second half of the year, which we expect with your incremental cost savings in 2020. And as you can see on right hand side of the slide, we now expect restructuring expense to be between $35 million to $45 million in 2019, some $10 million higher than our prior outlook.","And as Rick mentioned, we do see opportunities to further reduce SG&A engineering and overhead costs which will allow us to both improve our underlying profitability and also invest to support future long-term growth.","Slide 17 walks you through the key drivers of our revised revenue outlook relative to the one I provided three months ago. At the midpoint, our revised 2019 revenue range represented $215 billion change from our prior outlook. As you can see on the slide, this change is driven by three key factors.","First volume. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect global production to decline by approximately 5% in 2019, for 300 basis points incremental headwind to our overall revenue growth. This equates to approximately $120 million of the change in our revenue outlook.","From a more Delphi Technologies specific perspective, we have lowered our shorter-term volume assumptions for our Power Electronics business in the back half of the year, particularly in China, given the dynamics I described earlier.","Second foreign exchange where we ever devised a full year FX assumption. In terms of some of the key currencies, we now model the Euro, the U.S. dollar rate of 1.12 compared to our prior 1.15 assumption.","In addition, we now model the U.S. dollar to CNY rate of 6.85 compared to our previous estimate of 6.75. And the GBP we now assume a 1.25 versus a prior 1.30. The changes to our foreign currency assumptions translate to an approximately $50 million revenue impact on a full year basis.","And third, we have revised our aftermarket revenue growth expectations for the back half of the year, given some anticipated softness in North America and to a lesser extent in Europe. For the third quarter, we expect a mid to high single-digit adjusted year-on-year revenue decline.","In terms of some of the key assumptions, we estimate year-on-year global production to decline by approximately 1% with China declining by approximately 9%. Our revenues in China are expected to decline by more than 20% year-on-year in Q3. Its continued market softness and expected further inventory adjustments from some of our customers more than offset up 350 by GDI launches.","As you can see on slide 18, our prior adjusted operating margin outlook approximately 9% for the full year, which imply the second half adjusted margin improvement of approximately 300 basis points compared to the first half. Of this approximately three quarters or 200 to 250 basis points were related to Delphi Technologies initiatives or measures that are within our control. ","The balance of the margin improvement was expected to be driven by external or volume dependent drivers such as customer launches and operational improvements in GDI and Power Electronics.","As you move across the slide, you can see that now we expect our second half adjusted operating margin to improve by approximately 100 basis points, where the expected benefit from the Delphi Technologies specific initiatives are largely unchanged. The market and macro drivers such as global production, foreign exchange and tariffs have swung from being unexpected 50 to 100 basis points tailwind into 100 to 150 basis points headwinds in the second half of the year.","Looking at the drivers of what is within our control and where we continue to have good visibility, approximately one-third is related to the phasing of engineering costs. Approximately one-third is from the phasing of our SG&A where we remain on track to exit the number of transitional services agreements with our former parent through the year, which will eliminate duplicate costs in the second half, and particularly in Q4. ","And the remaining third is driven by improvements in our manufacturing materials performance consistent with the cadence we have delivered in prior years, partially offset by higher depreciation costs.","In total, we expect to achieve approximately one quarter of the improvements from these three dynamics in Q3, with the remaining three quarters in the fourth quarter.","Layering in our other key assumptions for Q3. We expect adjusted operating margin to be in the mid to 7% range or similar to the first half of our adjusted profit margins.","Slide 19 walks you through the changes in our operating cash flow for the year. As mentioned, I remain highly focused on our cash performance in 2019 and beyond. ","Relative to our prior outlook, the greatest impact is from the incremental industry and macro headwinds and the related impact on our full year operating income outlook. In addition, we expect to have $5 million to $10 million more in restructuring cash outflows related to the incremental SG&A savings we are now targeting. ","This is expected to be partially offset by our ongoing initiatives to improve working capital, particularly driven by reduction in inventories, aided by the exit of the contract manufacturer agreements with our former parent.","So, in closing and before we take your questions, despite a more challenging and uncertain macro and industry dynamics, my focus will remain on cost control and operating cash generation, while continuing to invest to support our longer-term growth.","With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David [ph] from Baird. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Rick Dauch","Hey, David.","Unidentified Analyst","So, they got some old history here. I mean, if we look at Power Electronics, and GDI since the spend that discussion was that they needed to get to like $500 million in sales, get scaled and leverage the margin on the contribution line. It sounds like that is no longer the proper framework. Is there an update or is it too early to go through that today?","Rick Dauch","So GDI, let me say on a macro basis, the change from get diesel GDI is real. And we'll get those revenues. We are fully on track and we expect to get to that breakeven position as we exit 2020.","Power Electronics is, as I said, the last quarter in this quarter again, it's very choppy in both the market dynamics, but also the intervention of the government's especially in China know, some of the credits we have here. And that's one of the things we're struggling with right now. We've made investments in one of our plans to launch that launch is delayed not because of us, but because of a customer. And we're not sure if it's a customer issue or is really a government issue. You want to comment more?","Vivid Sehgal","Yeah, I do. I think David, one of the major elements that we need to remember is GDI. The margin improvement is traditionally driven, as Rick said through operational improvement. And every quarter, we are seeing operational improvements continuing. So, from a GDI perspective, we remain confident that at the end of Q4 2020, we will reach breakeven.","In terms of Power Electronics, the main operating income sort of dilution right now is the level of engineering spend, that we have put the factory method, gross margins are relatively strong. And we are beginning to review the engineering spend that we need to have in place. ","So, in summary, GDI is on track for the end of 2020. And we believe that Power Electronics, if there is a change will be very modest, and we're perhaps moving out one or two quarters into 2020 as we refocus our operational costs and our SG&A and engineering focus. But we are confident that we will return to profitability pretty much in the same timeframe that we get before.","Rick Dauch","David -- another point, David is that, when we when we were spun off, we had to go out and create three factories. So, today still large portion of our revenue comes from a prior supplier. And there is a significant step function increase in our profitability in that business once we get start manufacturing on our own. And we are in the process of starting that process right now. ","Plants are built, equipments in place people been hired and trained. We're now going to the qualification mode customer by customer, product by product across Suzhou, Reynosa in Bologna, okay, so there is a lot of work going on here. We'll see a brighter day next year.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just one quick follow up on that. Are you comfortable that the price in the margin that was all booked at that there is not a structural problem on profitability of the contracts that are in hand already?","Rick Dauch","Based on what we seen and what I understand in my first six months, I think we're finding what market competitive, and I don't think we bought our market share is what -- if you are asking that.","Vivid Sehgal","And I would just add David, if you look at the landmark booking that we've just won, that\u2019s been done on the same basis in terms of our original pricing assumptions, we've not moved on those and it\u2019s been done on the same basis as the relic and I think if you look across all about technology, in GDI, Power Electronics, commercial vehicle, pricing right now is something that we're focusing on we have a balanced approach in terms of driving top-line as well, as continuing margin expansion and long-term profitability.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you and congratulations on the contract. ","Operator","Our next question comes from David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","David Tamberrino","Thanks for taking the question. You know it seems like 180 days and you've got -- what you've announced as a deep dive analysis on cost structure. I know you're trying to keep this at a high level, you're not trying to get into magnitude or timing but really would love to get your thoughts as to where you really see this going in 2020, 2021, 2022 and how fast you believe you can take action, it sounds like 3Q, 4Q we will see some things but for really that to start running through the P&L?","Rick Dauch","Good question, David. So, we put that chart up on the overhead cost structure to show you kind of where we are. You can kind of see where we think our Powertrain competitors are and you can see there is 150 to 200-point difference there. And then you can see the other tier ones, right. ","So, somewhere in between those two numbers is where we're going to get to. But we have to do, we've got to peel this onion back one piece at a time. Right. 25 engineering centers first of all, we know how many people there are now, we know what kind of classifications there, what type of engineers, we know the levels, we know the administrative support, people who are there, we've done a lot of work.","So, I\u2019m going to tell you my expectation, my experiences is that we've got to do this in a very disciplined process, this is not a rip and cut because we're in the middle of 160 launches and product development programs, we've got to make sure we don't drop any of those. ","And so that's why we're taking a little bit more time, but I think it's a two to three-year process and I will point you back to that slide in terms of where we think we can get to. That\u2019s on the R&D side. ","On the SG&A side, we have to complete the spin which we're on track to do so. There are some specific cost savings we're going to see in the back half of this year well relative to 2020, what we're analyzing right now is our current systems of networks either IT systems or applications that we have and how quick we can replace some of those and get the standard processes and what does that mean to us from an SG&A standpoint.","Okay. And what I see here at this company is similar what I saw in 1995 when I joined American Axle and that's 24 years ago, that's kind of almost shameful. But we'll get our hands around it, let's get 100% spun off first, we have our own systems, the guys have done a heck of a job in 18 months to put in the least of the infrastructures so we can talk to each other but we just basically cut and replace what we had at the previous, we've got to fix that. Does that answer your question?","David Tamberrino","That answers my question and that was not be with the piano?","Rick Dauch","That was not us either. We aren't having a party over here, so.","David Tamberrino","Okay. So. just a second question for Vivid, just looking at the walk, price downs for the quarter $100 million. Can you kind of give us a view as to how it looks going forward, were you able to offset some of the typical annual, or typical OEM to supply price downs and why that was much more favorable?","Vivid Sehgal","Yes, sure. David, it's coming from -- so our price downs are pretty similar to what that have been in the past, we always said between 1% to 2% and they remain in that territory. Right now the aftermarket team continues to do a great job in relation to the -- project will be called aftermarket 2020, where we're looking at looking margin expansion opportunities and we've been able to offset some of the typical price down that you see more in the Powertrain side of the business with some excellent pricing decisions and in the aftermarket. ","So, there is nothing underlying that's very different from what we've seen in the past, we are just very pleased that the aftermarket has been able to contribute and offset some of that typical down - price downs. ","Rick Dauch","David, there is one area that I think that is unique right now is that just goes back to economics 101, supply and demand. The move from light duty to gasoline direct inject is faster than anybody in industry expected here in Europe, there is a limited amount of capacity for GDI right now and so there are some pricing opportunities there for us right now as well, right. ","So, it's a kind of a twofold there. We need to get our own operations to be improved, and they're doing so. And like I said, I'm very happy at their performance the last two quarters. And we need to as customers ask for more capacity, we need to make sure that we get paid for that capacity, it's not free. ","You know, what we make here at Delphi Technologies is not some generic part that fuel injectors we make whether for passenger car or trucks are like Swiss watches. In fact, some of the equipment we use is used to make Swiss watches, and we need to get paid for it.","David Tamberrino","I understand. But just to clarify, within your guidance, are you expecting the for the second half to go back to the call at one and a half to 2% price downs? Or should we be thinking of something similar to call it half a percentage point?","Vivid Sehgal","I think you'll see the you'll see a slightly more negative price down in the second half of the year. So, we continue to have some very good aftermarket pricing, but you should see, sorry, soft and that number in terms of the price downs compared to what you've seen now in the second half.","David Tamberrino","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Levy [ph] from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to start, just ask a couple of questions in terms of the notion of sort of balancing growth alongside profitability. So, starting with Power Electronics, you obviously just put up a very, very nice win here, this $2.7 billion win. But I also see that you know, you have the language in there, you know, in terms of the driving the path to profitability, and you're sort of walking away from the sort of setting a hard date on reaching breakeven in Power Electronics, this idea of balancing, -- balancing the pace of investments. ","So, you have a lot of growth there that needs to be worked through. How do you balance investments that presumably need to support this growth? I mean, don't you have to just invest what you need to invest to support this?","Rick Dauch","Great question. First, we had to go build three factories, which we've done. We basically had to duplicate the capacity that was -- it used to be ours, of the old parent companies, we've got that in place now. Then we've won a few programs, which are launching in 2021, 2022, 2023. And we're putting those at capacity in place. ","The manufacturing team to do is, can you break that capital investment into modules, so we don't have to put a huge line and we can put different modules in and then we can then flex up as the volumes take-off.","For sure, one thing we've seen, at least since I've been here, six months, and since the company stood up 18 to 20 months ago, is that this launch of the electrification is quite choppy, right, so we put the money in and we put the capital investment, we put the engineering in there. But we're not seeing the revenue yet. We're going to see it. ","There are major capital investments being made by the largest OEMs in the world, in Europe, France, Germany, in China, in North America, to go to electric vehicles to meet the more stringent fuel economy emission standards, it's going to come. But there's going to be a tipping point. And so, we're kind of like a farmer who's ploughing the field and putting the seed in the ground and eventually is going to come and we're in that kind of phase right now. Okay.","Vivid Sehgal","I would just add, Rick, that, we've been in Power Electronics for a long time. So, we have put investments in early. And we're beginning and I think, just to the first question, we are clear that we're going to get back to profitability. Whether that's at the back end of 2019, or in 2020, we will drive that profitability in the business, because we've seen it, we've impacted early as Rick said, we're building the plants out right now. So, we're very confident we get that. ","But what we are going to do is fundamentally put the engineering spending to drive long term growth. And we have some very strong bookings, momentum coming through, 70% of our bookings this year, in excess of $5 billion are in the Power Electronics space, that gives us amazing confidence going forward that we are going to drive growth and if we need to put engineering behind that we will, because we were first coming in with our investments, we have very strong growth in electrification right now, we have the plans now to handle that growth. And we have a pathway to profitability. So, you know, we remain confident this is a very, very strong business for us that is going to provide very strong momentum, both in profit and in revenue.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it? And then second question, sort of in a in a similar vein. I mean, Rick, you when you joined, you noted that obviously some of the processes at Delphi were somewhat flawed in terms of launches and operational rigor. And I think you could argue that you had these flawed processes, but at the same time, you -- may be took on a larger backlog than the organization could choose. ","So, I guess my question is, is there still a commitment to stand by that backlog and obviously, the backlog or the bookings will go as the market goes, I mean, that's probably going to be the biggest driver. But is the commitment still to stand by that, or would you ever consider walking away from some of those if you just don't have the resources, or the capacity in place to support that?","Rick Dauch","Great question. So, let's start across on the commercial vehicle side, we've got multiple programs with multiple customers, and we had -- totally have our hands around those businesses, and it\u2019s going to be a significant technology change between 2020 and 2024, it's actually two step change there. Our team is working on that. It's one of the reasons I brought Todd in. And he and I've run a couple of the big program we have used already. And so, you'll see that -- that's under control, we won't walk away from there.","On the GDI side of the house, this is a generational transition of technology. For decades, Europe's been 50%, 55% diesel, and now it's going down to 10% or 15%. So, we get the great fortune of being the leaders of the company, as we make this massive investment and switch five or six plant over from diesel over to gasoline. That doesn't happen overnight. I can be a Monday morning quarterback and I can say we could have done a better job. ","I'll say we're doing a hell of a much better job in the last two quarters. We're doing regular program reviews about every six or seven weeks at my level, that had not happened before. I've asked people here, when is the last time a CEO sat in a program with you, one guy told me 24 years ago, when Lucas owned us, okay.","So that the intensity, in my experience of doing this for Axle and other companies, we know how to do, that's why Doris [ph] here and that's why Culton is here. And the team's responding quite well.","On the Power Electronics standpoint, the whole industry is going through a huge change right now, right. And so, we're going -- I don't think that anyone is walking away, but we have told our team don't take on more business that we don't have the resources to handle what we already have. And so, we're being very selective and what we bid on going forward.","Part of our restructuring of our technical center footprint, will free up the cash that allows us to then put more engineers in, or to subcontract some of that engineering to outside suppliers that can help us. ","We love to do every single line of code; we don't do every single electronic circuit board. We're trying to balance that right now. So, across our three businesses, commercial vehicle, very confident, transitioning to light duty diesel to gas, we've got to transition some of our diesel engineers over to gasoline, little slightly differences. ","In electronics, we can only grow as fast as the resources we have available to do it. Okay, the demand to move to electric vehicles, at least in the early stages from the OEMs when they're going to launch in 2023, 2024 is tremendous. And we put our team on, let's focus on what we have and let\u2019s flawlessly executed. And if you can reuse some of those designs on future quotes, let's go and do it.","But you just can't keep throwing engineering bodies that stuff that's not going to last for four or five years. Does that answer your question?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, that's very helpful. Thank you.","Rick Dauch","Great.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is open.","Brian Johnson","Yes, good morning, or good afternoon, to those in London. I have kind of three questions mid short term, midterm long-term. So, sort of short term, I'm just kind of scratching my head over the growth under market in North America. And in particular, the decision on with the OEM -- for sedans, GM to one [indiscernible] has been out for a while. So, did this take you by surprise in the quarter, was it contemplated in the guidance or what happened?","Vivid Sehgal","Hi, Brian, it's Vivid. That was contemplated in the guidance, so that was always expect in that as our assumptions around that have not changed.","Brian Johnson","Okay, midterm, how do we get comfortable with the margin in 4Q, which is mid to 9, high 9%, and how does that tie in with some of the initiatives that you've been outlining?","Vivid Sehgal","So we were, I mean, a lot of the Q4 visibility, so you're absolutely right in terms of the margin of Q3, that's going to be sort of a mid-seven, so as we have which is pretty much in line with the H1 margins as well. ","From our perspective, we are pretty confident on the Q4 margin of that and we have pretty good visibility. These are within our controls, and not subject to the market and the macro impacts that are there. They're really broken down into three parts, and most of these are ongoing initiatives that we've seen on a regular basis in past years as well. ","So, we're very clear, our engineering, we will have a significant ramp down in engineering both on a gross basis, as well as the normal engineering recoveries that come in Q4. And so, we will have a material lower engineering spend in Q4. And that's been similar to the previous years that we've had.","We've also got the final sort of roll off on the duplicate operating costs as we come off the final part of our TSAs. And the final one will come off in August and we are in the process of eliminating duplicate operating expenses and SG&A and that process has started now, and we will see material benefits of that in Q4. And the last one is just to begin a regular cadence of where we recover on a manufacturing and material basis.","We have again, a regular cadence of events where we see an uptick in terms of the savings, but we have on that side. So, we have confidence that the Q4 uptick. We have visibility around it. Having said that, of course, we have revised our outlook at this stage to lower the Q4 numbers, which gives us even further confidence that we can hit that.","Brian Johnson","And then right in the long-term. I guess there's still confusion on product portfolio of GDI and Power Electronics and the margin potential in the 2020, which you've kind of discussed on. So, I guess the fundamental question is, if you kind of think of getting to profitability in both product lines as some function of how the contracts were priced, just the overhead economics of growing into a factory.","And then just sort of the input costs and whatnot from the supply chain. So, as we think about, I guess the question we have is, to what extent are some of those contracts just underpriced? So even if you get the capacity with good utilization in the streets and costs out of manufacturing engineering still not a profitable business?","Rick Dauch","Brian, good question, right. So, on GDI standpoint, there is a lot of engineering money that was put into qualify the 350-bar system and the 500-bar system and so we know what that number is. And that numbers pretty fixed and it might go down a little bit in the future, but sales are more than double or triple over the next three or four years, right. I think our target longer term is to get over a $1 billion dollar in GDI, right? But engineering is kind of fixed there, okay?","I will tell you that we had a horrendous launch in 2018 and 2019. We aren't hiding from that. Significant premium. Significant scrap and repairs too many extra people, didn't make our production targets. What I'm telling is, we've been focused on that about the third week of January when I got here. We're seeing marked improvement of our five plants that are running today, four of them are ahead of our targets that we put in place back around February and one is off track. And we're going to do a program review there in early September.","So, there is nothing I've seen in the business model or in the forecast that we can get to where our target margins are in GDI. So, I don't think it's underpriced. We've also going back to some of the customers and have addressed price where there's been opportunities when they've asked for more capacity. So that's a good thing. ","On the PE margins, Power Electronics on paper, they look real good. But on paper, we got to see the volumes come across those assets we put in place, right? And right now, we're not seeing the volumes across some of those assets.","And again, I go back to what I said before, we're in the process of transitioning from an old parent makes parts for us and now we're going to do it ourselves. And it's going to take us all the way to the first quarter of 2020 to get all that transition to a plan. So, we're going through tremendous cost right now. We basically a duplicate people, as we built our Poland plant, they had to go to Hungary and be trained for 6 months.","Now we're training the next step. We're going from zero people electronics plan to over 200 in less than 12 months. All that money to train the people to get them screen and get them on-board, to go to the launches. Those are all expenses were occurring right now. So, I'm confident, we've got to get through this transition period both on GDI, I think that'll come faster, because winds are going faster, and the Power Electronics didn't take us a couple of years.","Brian Johnson","Okay. Thank you.","Vivid Sehgal","Good question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Emmanuel Rosner","Hi. Hello, everybody.","Rick Dauch","Hi Emmanuel, how are you doing?","Emmanuel Rosner","Good. How are you?","Rick Dauch","Good.","Emmanuel Rosner","I'm still struggling a little bit with the very big ramp up that's implied in your guidance for the fourth quarter. And what exactly drives that? Obviously, you've changed the second half outlook for margin. Some used to be maybe 10.5% in midpoint sort of like 8.5% through saying that most of the costs coming out is really a fourth quarter rather than a second half event. ","Was it always the case? Like when you had $0.10 to $0.11 in the second half? Were you looking at like 12% to 13% in the fourth quarter? Or has there been a push out of some of these actions? And can you just go over again what exactly is hitting fourth quarter that that's not in the third quarter.","Vivid Sehgal","Emmanuel, it's Vivid here. There has been no change in the cadence of the sort of benefit of the Q4 operating income margin expansion. So, if you look at our second half performance, the majority of the shortfall in the margin has come from the macro micro, so effectively with all the sort of trade volume declines that have come through. ","The actual sort of Delphi Technologies specific actions to drive margin have remained largely unchanged. There is no material difference to what we presented previously, apart from the macro and industry volume reductions that we have. ","So, from our perspective just to sort of repeat, really the biggest element here is around the engineering spend, if you look at our engineering spend just to give you a bit more color, we're closer to sort of 9% to 10% in relation to the first three quarters of this year. And with the recoveries that we always get in Q4 as well as some of the cost actions that we've had in place that we identified some period ago. And we have clear visibility around, that number comes down at least 200 basis points in the Q4, we're a very confident around that number.","The second one, as I said is, we are now coming off the final transition service agreements with all the duplicate operating costs that we've had in places like IT, finance as we come off the TSAs that will finalize in Q4, and we've already started the process of eliminating the duplicate headcount processes. And again, that started, and we have a very clear visibility about that as well.","And then lastly, just the material and the manufacturing efficiency we have in place. That is traditionally the best quarter is Q4, you can go back at least two to three years and see that on a regular basis, we've made improvements on that basis. And again, that is built into our forecast and we haven't changed our assumptions on that. ","The only thing that has changed is the market, the industry where we've had to take down from minus two to minus five, that's driven the change in the margin trajectory, everything within our control is on track right now.","Emmanuel Rosner","That's very helpful. And so, if I want to take that one step further, and you know, try to extrapolate some of that into what may or may not be a good run rate sort of entering or starting point entering 2020. It seems there's kind of the three buckets to you just named the service agreements, obviously, to continue to remain sort of at the lower level as you move to next year. ","The manufacturing efficiencies obviously, as well. assuming no big changes in production. It just feels like the first bucket, the recovery seems to be just something that's towards the end of the year, and that's not necessarily a full year run rate. Am I looking at this, right?","Vivid Sehgal","Yes. Yes, you are. So if you're looking at on that basis, I mean, if you look at the business, if you look forward to 2020, obviously, we're not going to lean right now into 2020 margin, given the dynamics that we have in display, you know, right now. But certainly, the trajectory going forward, we look at the SG&A and the duplicate savings that we have in place. ","You know, yes, material manufacturing, there is a big focus on that, given some of the new resources and talent that we bought into the organization with Rick's focus as well. Engineering is a normal cadence. And going forward, of course, and we believe that the mix on GDI and Power Electronics margins will improve. And we're going to look from further cost efficiencies in this company, with or without the restructuring benefits that are available to us. ","But given all of that you're in a situation whereby, you know, we just have to look at the macros we need to look at industry volume, when you look at sort of CV North America, some of the tariffs headwinds, all of those good things are continuing to be, as well as FX, they continue to be the sort of outlier that we continue to monitor, but what's within our control? We're confident we can achieve and improve on the processes that we're showing in Q4.","Emmanuel Rosner","Great. Thanks for the color.","Rick Dauch","Good questions.","Operator","Our next question from Dan James [ph] from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning. Just my first question is related to your assumptions for China product market production. It is going down from minus 8 to minus 12. How much of that is related to the second half? ","I guess what I'm getting at is are you guys seeing, you know, any kind of deterioration in second half expectations versus kind of where the third parties are and where they were, you know, where were you were thinking a couple of months ago.","Vivid Sehgal","Yes. So, all together. That we know if we look at our own performance in terms of China right now. We sort of, if I look at the market, our assumptions at this point, you look at a sort of Q1 position of about minus 11 for the market, and the market was down about close to minus 20% in Q2. ","We see more of a sort of minus 10 range in the second half of this year. And, we -- there's partly the fact that there are two reasons for that, I think the first one, and so we continue to see softness, we're not assuming an incentive. ","And in terms of our own, if I dial it back a little bit, in terms of our own revenues, we saw a close to minus 20% to 25% in the first half of this year, and we're getting sort of back into the sort of minus 8 to minus 10 in the second half. So, we do see some growth coming or less negative in the second half of the year. And really two things replay here, ","I think we saw really major softness in China, with some of the inventory adjustments hitting us in Q4 last year. So, we're overlapping some pretty weak quarters. That's number one. And from our own perspective, we continue to launch. And we do have some important launches that are going on in Q4, particularly on the GDI and Power Electronics side, which gives us confidence of margin and revenue trajectory going into 2020. ","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Got it. So just essentially, you think that your kind of revenue mix is going to be more consistent with the market and a second half in China, and then I just have to follow up. ","Vivid Sehgal","Yes, that's exactly what we said.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. And then, you know, it's interested in your comment about, you know, 500 bar GDI technology, you know, not really requiring a lot of incremental plant capacity, or switching from 350. I mean, get just bigger picture. You know, it sounds like there's a ton of CapEx this year that that may not may not repeat in the future. Do you have any sense of kind of what your more sustainable CapEx number would be? You know, beyond 2019, the next few years?","Vivid Sehgal","Yes, sure. So right now, this year, we're going to be probably in the range of closer to 7%, in relation to CapEx and that's partly for two reasons. It's the sort of incremental CapEx that from a business perspective we've put in place given particularly the GDI capacity that we've done given some of the strong growth and current and future growth that we expect. ","But we also had some onetime CapEx that's in play right now. So, in terms of our separation, CapEx, as Rick mentioned, the build out about three electrification plants as well as a stand-up of our IT infrastructure, we're probably spending about $30 million to $40 million CapEx this year, that we will not plan to replicate going forward. So, I think you can look at our CapEx at about 7% this year. And, you know, sort of going forward ranges more in the 5% to 6%, is what we expect on an ongoing basis.","Rick Dauch","Yes, Dan it looks like from what I see. So, I've been here is the typical power train somewhere between 5%, 6% and a half 7%. I think we're going to fall in that range. As David says, I think we're going through some unique time right now, in terms of standing up the company doing the transition over to GDI. I think there's a few things wherever I go, I find things that are broken over the last few years, they'll be a little bit of CapEx. But I think that number of them gave me is pretty good.","Vivid Sehgal","And I think you know, Rick and I have spoken a lot about this, I think the one thing that we need to think about is the way we use CapEx, I think given some of the macro and industry trends right now, we're looking at it in a slightly different way. ","And the way we're looking at it is that from a GDI perspective, you have the opportunity to switch over from 350 bar to 500 bar with small modifications on the campaign, so effectively it's reusable. ","On the Power Electronics side of the business, given some of the choppiness that we've seen, given the macro conditions, we're also going take a hard look, and we are taking a hard look at that. And that is also reusable CapEx. ","So, in a win, for example, that we've just recently gone through at least 60% to 70% of that capital is reusable and more generic in nature. So, it means it volumes because a market then come through, we can switch that CapEx into other areas as number one. ","And the second thing is we're taking a more modular approach to CapEx right now, where we're not going to install CapEx in all in one go, and we're going to take a breathing point over a period of time to see where the volumes are going. Because we are very confident about our volumes in Power Electronics, but it makes sense from a management team to actually take a breath and make sure that we phase it rather than throwing it all in one go.","Rick Dauch","Yes, a couple comments here. So, I've typicallycome from industries where we're doing heavy manufacturing, big forgenes and stamping, big machining, assembly. Here at Delphi, it's a little more sophisticated manufacturing in terms of very high volume,precision grinding, machining, lot of robotics. ","And then on the electronic side, clean room situations, surface mount technology, the assembly operations. And so, the manufacturing guys are taking a hard look of what's really core versus non-core, do we need to put the capital in ourselves, or can we do it from the outside and save some capital, that's an opportunity.","We fully utilize the capital we have by using it, three shifts a day, five days a week, or six or seven days a week where it makes sense to do so when you have the ability to do so with the labor unions and sub. ","Two, I'd say, now that we've gone around the world and seen all of our technical centers, we're spending too much money there, trying to maintain 25 different engineering sites and all the equipment goes with it. ","I don't need eight materials labs, they also have microscopes and test facilities, and so there'll be some scale back there, too. I think we'll have a much better handle. But generally power train suppliers, when everything I've read, it somewhere between five to six, sometimes up to seven, when you're going through some kind of launch.","On the GDI going to 500 bar, what like I said, I'm very complimentary towards our product and process engineers, they divide, they design the new system to fit into the area of the engine without having to redesign the engine first for the OEM. And we can run the same stuff down our lines that we run today. Okay, so that's a great smart use of our money down the road. Okay. So, does that help? ","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Yeah, for sure. Thanks a lot.","Rick Dauch","Okay, great.","Operator","I am showing no further question at this time, I want to turn call back to Rick Dauch, Chief Executive Officer of Delphi Technologies, for closing remarks.","Rick Dauch","Right, Jarenda thank you very much, and thank you for everybody on the phone call. We appreciate your interest in Delphi Technologies. We look forward to seeing you on the road. We'll probably see you many of you over at the Frankfurt IA show here in September. Enjoy your summer.

My name is Sarah and I'll be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Delphi Technologies' First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and simultaneously webcast.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sherief Bakr, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sherief, please go ahead.","Sherief Hassan Bakr - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Delphi Technologies' first quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today in London is our Chief Executive Officer, Liam Butterworth; our Chief Financial Officer, Vivid Seghal; as well as our Chief Technology Officer, Mary Gustanski.","This call will include a discussion of our first quarter financial results as disclosed in today's press release, as well as our updated outlook for 2018. In order to follow along with today's presentation, you can find an accompanying set of slides on our Investor Relations website at ir.delphi.com.","Please note that our discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to their corresponding GAAP measures in the tables within our press release. Now, before we begin, I'd like to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's Form 10-K, as well as other filings with the SEC. I'd encourage all of you to review these risk factors listed in these documents.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Liam Butterworth.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thank you, Sherief, and good morning, good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call. Before I provide an update on progress we've made during our first full quarter as a public company, I want to share with you some of the highlights for Q1.","Vivid will take you through more of the details of our performance and our updated outlook for 2018. But at a high level, we've had a great start to the year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements which were a significant tailwind in the quarter, our underlying performance is on track, and we continue to see strong momentum in key areas of the portfolio that will drive our long-term growth.","On slide 3, you can see some of the highlights for the quarter. We delivered 5% revenue growth which was 6% above market and an adjusted operating margin of 12.3%. Excluding the commercial settlement that positively impacted our Q1 2017 results, our year-on-year operating margin expanded by 80 basis points on a like-for-like basis.","This included strong year-on-year margin expansion from our Aftermarket business, consistent with our strategy and full year objectives. EPS of $1.30 benefited from a more favorable FX environment, phase-in of spin-related and underlying business performance. We also ended the quarter with a solid balance sheet and liquidity profile which allows us to continue to reinvest in the business to drive long-term growth.","As I just mentioned, we continue to see strong demand in key areas of the portfolio where we have great momentum with customers across the globe. We're especially excited by the increasing momentum we are seeing in our electrification portfolio for both existing program volumes and the extensive global pursuit activity in our pipeline.","This clearly reinforces the unique capability we have in this space. $3 billion of bookings in the quarter is a tremendous way to start the year. We have significant wins in advanced gasoline systems, electronic controllers and the electrification. And on a full year basis, we remain on track to exceed our record bookings performance from last year.","Operationally, we made strong progress in the quarter and remain laser-focused on coming off the transition service agreements in a timely and cost effective manner. At the same time, we are continuing to invest in building our own appropriate stand-alone functional capabilities. Putting all this together, our underlying performance is on track and we've increased our full-year revenue and earnings outlook for 2018.","Turning to slide 4, we operate in a market where we continue to benefit from regulatory-driven and consumer demand for more efficient propulsion systems. Our teams are dedicated to developing pioneering technologies and services that help our customers meet their future propulsion system challenges across the full spectrum of technologies.","Looking at the trends in the market, we continue to see strong demand for more fuel efficient propulsion systems, such as GDi, which grew by 20% in the quarter and commercial vehicle diesel systems which saw 25% year-on-year growth in Q1 and especially in China where we saw around 50% year-on-year growth. At the same time, we've seen further acceleration in activity around electrification, especially for high-voltage solutions with both existing customers and pursuits we currently see in the marketplace. For example, our Power Electronics business grew by 65% in Q1, which is a reflection of the continuing acceleration of electrified powertrains.","Our proven expertise in Power Electronics design, development, and software systems continues to uniquely position us to capture significant incremental content per vehicle. We recently hosted a Power Electronics teach-in for the investment community led by Mary Gustanski, our CTO. And for those of you who are unable to dial in, I would really encourage you to listen to the replay on our investor relations site.","On the bottom of the slide, I've also highlighted some of the industry-related headlines that have been particularly topical over the last quarter. As you can see, we've seen a combination of macro, political and regulatory matters that have created a lot of discussion. From a Delphi Technologies' perspective, we view them as part of the normal course of business. An important characteristic of our business is that we have balance in our portfolio, customer mix and footprint, which ensures we are less exposed to any one single market driver. This gives us the flexibility to adapt our business based on how and when the market evolves.","Touching on light duty diesel, a topic that I know has been in focus for many of you on the call. Over the last few months, we've seen a number of headlines related to diesel bans in certain European cities, as well as the potential for an even faster decline in diesel penetration. While these headlines further underscore our portfolio decisions related to light duty diesel over the last four years, they do not materially alter our view on the expected headwinds we've assumed for 2018 and beyond.","As we have commented in the past, the expected decline in our light duty diesel revenues are driven more by program roll-offs where we have good visibility rather than market penetration assumptions. In addition, our remaining programs are predominantly for larger engine displacements rather than the sub 2-liter market, where OEMs in Europe are accelerating the transition from diesel to highly efficient gasoline solutions such as GDi, as well as increased electrification.","Turning to slide 5. Building on our strong momentum in the marketplace over the past couple of years, our bookings performance in Q1 was a real highlight and reflects our customers' continued recognition of the technologies and value that we provide. While the nature of quarterly bookings tend to be lumpy, $3 billion lifetime revenue booked in the first three months is a tremendous start to the year and puts us in a strong position to deliver another year of record bookings in 2018.","I was especially pleased with the mix of our bookings in Q1, which was split pretty evenly between our electrification and internal combustion engine technologies. This not only underscores the strength and depth of our portfolio, but it is also fully aligned with our balanced strategy and disciplined commercial approach.","Looking at some of our key wins in the quarter. In the Powertrain segment, there were a number of highlights. We booked a major 350 bar GDi program with a global OEM for their next-generation gasoline engine platform, as well as a significant fuel management program with a premium global OEM.","For electronics, our extensive track record, differentiating technologies, and software systems expertise are clearly highly valued by our customers to assist them in their path to electrification across the full range of their high voltage requirements. In the first quarter, we extended our successful partnership with Volvo for our combined inverter and DC\/DC converter, as well as with BMW for our high voltage inverter and onboard charger.","And just to emphasize the content opportunity for Delphi Technologies, the average content per vehicle on these two Power Electronics bookings is more than six times our average content per vehicle for an advanced gasoline system. In addition, we were delighted to have booked a major 48-volt, mild hybrid DC\/DC program with a premium global OEM. This further positions us well for long-term growth as part of our overall Power Electronics portfolio.","Turning to slide 6. A key element of our DNA continues to be our relentless focus and obsession for operational excellence, in areas such as footprint optimization, excellence in quality, flawless customer launches and leveraging our enterprise operating system. As I commented on last quarter's call, we completed the separation of our business ahead of schedule and have carried that momentum into our first full quarter as a stand-alone public company.","All our transition service and contract manufacturing service agreements with Aptiv are now fully operational. And in line with our plans, we have already started the process of coming off a number of the TSAs. At the same time, we've made significant progress in establishing our stand-alone functions, to replace the services which are covered by the TSAs, such as human resources, IT and finance.","So, we're very much on track in terms of our full year outlook for spin-related costs and have better line of sight in how we plan to aggressively burn off these costs over the next couple of years. Vivid, the entire leadership team, and I, continue to be all over this and separation management remains a key part of our weekly operating cadence.","In addition, we're taking a clean sheet approach to how we create the optimal structure for our size and shape of company rather than simply replicating how support functions are set up under the TSAs. This should yield an even more efficient operational structure to support our future growth and investment opportunities.","So, summarizing on slide 7, we feel great about where we are, and we had a flawless start to the year. We delivered solid revenue growth, expanded underlying operating margin and continued to have great momentum with our core technologies. From both a financial and an operational perspective, we are on track with where we expected to be, and we've increased our revenue and EPS outlook for the year.","So following our first full quarter as a public company, we are fully on track to deliver our commitments. I'll now turn the call over to Vivid to take you through the financials in more detail and our outlook for 2018.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thank you, Liam, and good morning, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. As Liam just outlined, we had a strong Q1 without raising our outlook for the full year. And looking out beyond 2018, we are firmly on the pathway to return to our pre-spin operating margin by 2020 and significantly improving our cash flows.","So let's start with a high level recap of our Q1 financials which you can see on slide 9. Before I get into the discussion of our year-on-year performance in Q1 and similar to last quarter's slides, you will see that we have presented the prior year's results on both the pro forma and reported basis. The difference, $20 million of revenue and $13 million of operating income reflects the pro forma adjustments I referenced on last quarter's call, related to our separation and gives you the right starting point to compare our year-on-year growth in Q1.","Revenue of $1.3 billion in the quarter increased by 4.6% year-on-year and adjusted operating income of $159 million increased by $10 million. Note that our adjusted operating income in Q1 2017 benefited from a $17 million commercial settlement. Excluding this, adjusted operating margin increased by 80 basis points driven by foreign exchange benefits and continued operational performance which more than offset unfavorable mix and higher engineering spend.","Adjusted EPS of $1.30 came in ahead of expectations, primarily related to the weaker dollar and, to a lesser extent, the phasing of spin-related costs which were approximately $5 million lower than we'd assumed for Q1. Operating cash flow of $75 million was in line with our expectations and we remain on track to deliver on our full-year target. And finally, we ended Q1 with a total cash balance of $316 million.","Turning to slide 10. Q1 revenue of $1.3 billion was up 4.6% year-on-year and approximately 6% above market growth. We continue to see strong year-on-year growth across key areas of our portfolio. Commercial vehicle revenues increased by approximately 25%, GDi revenues were up approximately 20%, and Power Electronics revenues increased by approximately 65%. Passenger car light duty diesel revenues declined by almost 20% in the quarter, a 200 basis point headwind to our overall top line growth.","From a regional perspective, our Q1 revenue was driven by strong growth in China, which increased 15% year-on-year. In addition, North America revenues were up 6% or 8% above market. Revenues in the quarter were flat year-on-year in Europe as growth in commercial vehicle and GDi was offset by the ongoing decline in light duty diesel revenues.","Slide 11 walks through our operating income growth for Q1. Adjusted operating income was $159 million in Q1, up 7% year-on-year. Excluding the commercial settlement that we benefited from the prior year, adjusted operating income increased by 20%. This was driven by foreign exchange benefits, as well as continued improvements in operational performance. This more than offset higher engineering spend and, to a lesser extent, higher commodity prices.","Turning to our segment performance on the next slide. Powertrain Systems revenue grew 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by strong growth in commercial vehicle, GDi and Power Electronics, which more than offset the decline in light duty diesel revenues. Passenger car light duty diesel revenues declined by approximately 20% in Q1, driven by lower European sales which were down approximately 25% year-on-year. This was driven by a combination of program roll-offs and lower market penetration.","Our revenues outside of Europe increased in the quarter, driven by programs in India and other Asian markets, largely due to regulatory requirements. Excluding the customer settlement from Q1 2017, adjusted operating margin of 12.3% for the quarter was up 20 basis points year-on-year, as foreign exchange benefit and strong operating performance, more than offset negative product mix and higher engineering spend.","Turning to our Aftermarket segment on slide 13. On last quarter's call, I commented that we were focusing our Aftermarket business on higher margin revenue opportunities in order to drive operating leverage, and I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q1. The revenue of $217 million increased by 1% in the first quarter, driven by growth in the OES channel. Adjusted operating margin expanded by 390 basis points year-on-year, driven by our commercial strategy and operational performance. As we look into the balance of 2018, we remain focused on delivering full-year margin improvement to the Aftermarket business compared 2017.","Now, let's move to our expected updates for 2018. Slide 14 outlines our revised outlook for the year. At a high level, our underlying outlook is largely unchanged from our previous ranges, and the increase is primarily driven by more favorable foreign exchange dynamics. For 2018, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $5 billion to $5.2 billion, a $100 million increase from our prior range. This outlook assumes, first, we continue to expect an approximately 200 basis point headwind to our top line from the decline in our light duty diesel business. Our forecast is aligned with our customer programs and we have reduced our European revenues for the balance of the year. This is partially offset by higher revenues and expectations from our outside-of-Europe programs.","Second, we continue to expect GDi and commercial vehicle to deliver another year of robust growth. Third, we continue to expect our Power Electronics business to see more than 50% growth in 2018. And finally, our Aftermarket segment assumptions are essentially unchanged, with lower year-on-year growth expected, as a result of our decision to focus on higher margin channels.","The full-year adjusted operating margin is now expected to be in the range of 12.3% to 12.5%, up 10 basis points from our prior expectations and represents a 40 basis point to 60 basis point margin expansion from our pro forma 2017 margin of 11.9%. This margin outlook continues to include approximately $70 million of spin-related and public company costs. In addition, we have incorporated $5 million to $10 million of higher-commodity exposure which we believe covers the current risk for the year.","In terms of the key drivers of our expected margin expansion in 2018, I would like to highlight the following. Positive drivers include ongoing benefits from our prior restructuring assets, material and manufacturing cost improvements, expected margin improvements in our Aftermarket segment and foreign exchange tailwinds. This is expected to be partially offset by price concessions in the region of 1.5% to 2%, incremental R&D spend to drive long-term growth, and a negative mix impact, driven by higher sales of Power Electronics and GDi.","And for adjusted EPS, our outlook now calls for earnings per share in the range of $4.65 to $4.95 or a $0.15 raise to the top and the bottom end of our prior range. Please note that our 2018 outlook now assumes a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of $1.20. All of the other outlook metrics provided last quarter are essentially unchanged.","While we are not providing a specific quarterly outlook for the second quarter, I wanted to provide you with some color on how we see our phasing through the year. Starting with revenue, we continue to expect to see stronger growth in the first half of the year, driven in part by the year-on-year comps and the rate of decline in our passenger car diesel business. Our Q1 performance was stronger than expected, primarily due to foreign exchange tailwinds and, to a lesser extent, by the phasing of spin-related and public company costs, which we expect to increase in Q2. Of the approximate $70 million of cost for the year, we expect them to be fairly evenly spread between the first and the second half.","Before turning the call back for your questions, I want to share some perspective on our approach to capital allocation, which you can see on slide 15. As a relatively new public company, our capital allocation focus for 2018 is to ensure we execute on our operational targets and spin-related activities, as well as prioritizing investments in organic growth, namely CapEx to support our bookings momentum, and R&D spend focused on new technologies with the highest growth potential. This will give us a strong basis to position Delphi Technologies for sustainable, long-term growth.","In addition, the attractive cash flow characteristics of our business gives us the ability to further strengthen our balance sheet. Consistent with this, we are targeting a through-the-cycle net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.5 times. And we are comfortable to go up to 2 times. And for the right value-enhancing M&A opportunities, we believe we have the flexibility to go higher. To be clear, while our focus is still on investing to support organic growth, we will look for bolt-on M&A opportunities that strengthen our existing portfolio of advanced technologies and create value for our shareholders.","Finally, we will continue to return capital to our shareholders. We have already instituted a quarterly dividend program of $0.17 per share which we expect to maintain and increase going forward. Looking further ahead, we will consider implementing a share repurchase program as part of our overall capital allocation policy and plans to stay within our targeted leverage range.","In closing, in a dynamic market environment, we delivered a strong first quarter. We've raised our outlook for the year and are fully focused on executing our strategy of profitable growth and improving our cash flows.","With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Vivid, I just want maybe some clarification on some of the spin and public company costs you just talked about. So, you mentioned spin costs ramp through the year. Are you talking about the public company costs or the separation cost that you're backing out that we need to consider from a cash perspective?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Hello, Joe. I'm talking about the public company costs that are included within the adjusted numbers. So, that percentage is...","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And did you just say that was \u2013 is that $17 million for the year?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yes. That's in line with what we called out before. Correct.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And it was about $9 million in the first quarter you said?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","No. So, it was probably in the range of around about $10 million to $15 million in the first quarter. So, $70 million and we believe that it will be evenly phased in the first and the second half of this year.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","But then how is that ramping down? Oh, $70 million, 7-0, I thought you said $17 million...","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","$70 million. Yes.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","No. 7-0 for the year, evenly spread between the first and the second half.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Okay. And then just from the cash side, it looks like cash restructuring was $7 million and, I think, you guided to something closer to $100 million. And the separation was \u2013 looks like maybe $10 million and, I think, that was sort of $7 million (00:25:08) already. So, those ramped as well?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Correct. So, the numbers that I provided previously in relation to \u2013 in sort of just under $100 million for the restructuring and about $70 million for the onetime separation cost, yeah, they still hold today.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then just with all the different puts and takes and some of the other factors you mentioned on guidance, your prior free cash flow guidance at the midpoint was around $170 million, is that still unchanged?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","So, we're not changing any of the outlook in terms of operating cash flow or free cash flow right now. So, that's correct, yes.","Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll get back in queue.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is now open.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi there. This is Joe Vruwink on for David.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Good morning, Joe.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Obviously, a meaningful acceleration in bookings this quarter. How much is the function of just the overall pipeline more content available broadly across Powertrain and Electronics? And how much of this big step-up, would you say, is more a function of Delphi's market share just being higher?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Hi. Good morning. This is Liam. So, I think the first thing is really our bookings tend to be \u2013 in the Powertrain space tend to be relatively lumpy on a quarterly basis. If you look at our bookings in Q1 2017, we were about $2 billion. So, we have a significant uptick in bookings for the first quarter this year. Those bookings are balanced pretty evenly across the two main businesses that we have, which is our internal combustion engine portfolio and also across our electronics and electrification portfolio.","And if I look out for the rest of the year, we remain very confident that we will exceed the bookings, the record bookings number that we had in 2017, which I think was around $7.1 billion. So, we remain confident we're going to exceed that. And the primary driver really is just we've been very, very focused in terms of our portfolio, in terms of which pursuits we go after across our commercial vehicle, internal combustion engine, electronics and electrification. And we've got a very good strong visibility in terms on our portfolio or our pipeline, should I say, of pursuits that we're actively working on across those businesses so we remain very comfortable in terms of where we are.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, Liam. I guess the reason I ask the question, so looking at the multi-year CAGR of 15%, that to me really reflects more Powertrain content, more electrification content broadly across the industry and Delphi maintaining a healthy share position in that market. But to do, as you said, 50% growth in Q1 and I understand this is lumpy, it would seem to suggest that maybe your win rate is starting to step up. The backdrop is still very healthy, a lot of content but the win rate might be improving as well.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah I think that's a pretty accurate statement. And again we've been very, very focused in terms of which programs we pursue with which OEMs and which level of technology but I think it's a fair \u2013 it's an accurate statement that our win rate remains, is strong and say the growth, we're seeing that in our revenue numbers. And again if I look at our pipeline of pursuits that we've got for the rest of the year, we remain confident that we've got some very strong bookings performance and outlook for future growth.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then my last question which I understand is entirely too soon but with your pipeline doing as good as it is, diesel obviously is contained within your existing expectations. When do you think you could get to a point where the outgrowth targets you've communicated, maybe those could be in a position to be raised higher?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","So, at this point \u2013 it's Vivid here \u2013 we're maintaining our sort of outlook. And for the time being, I think what's critically important for us is just to make sure that we hit our 2018 targets, we deliver on our expectations, and of course, we're going to take a look at our medium-term numbers again. But for now no change. We are confident and we have a clear visibility to get there in terms of both our sales, EPS and our cash flow targets.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. And we've said the light duty diesel headwind will be around 200 basis points...","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Next two to three years.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","...for the next two to three years whilst we burn that out of the system.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Absolutely.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask you first on your slide 11, and just trying to get over, a color on the incremental margins. I was a little surprised by the flow-through to earnings of the FX and commodity bucket. Looks like it's like north of 30% incremental margin on these higher revenues. Is that sort of like the right rate to think about it? And then similar question on the volume side, it looks like the incremental margin on your performance growth was probably only like in the mid-teens or so which seems maybe a little bit low. So, is that sort of like the right range going forward?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Sure. In terms of quarter 1, we obviously had a sort of a big disparity between Q1 2017 FX rates versus quarter 1 2018. You think about this quarter, it was \u2013 quarter 1 was about an average of $1.23 versus an average of about $1.07 for the previous year's quarter. So, in Q1, we really had two impacts in relation to FX. We have the normal translation, which we hit our top line revenue growth and flowed through to that 15% to 20% in relation to the operating income margin.","But we did also have some transactional FX upside this year in relation to some of the balance sheet, the items that we have. That's a very normal part of our business. It can go up, it can go down. So, I think that was the main reason why the flow-through in Q1 was relatively strong.","As we go out for the rest of the year, we obviously see the second half of 2018. The FX rates beginning to converge and if you look at half one 2017 versus our new assumption of $1.20, they're pretty similar and in line. So, some of the FX benefits that we're seeing in the first half, in the first quarter will not be flowing through to the same level and degree that we see in the second half. And frankly, that's why we've increased our EPS guidance by the $0.15 to reflect our best view of FX and operational performance right now.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And on the volume piece?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","On volume piece, we've already talked that we see that sort of margins on the volume flow through is going to be in about the 20% range. That's how we see it down to our line (00:32:33).","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Understood. So, yeah, that's a good color. My next question was I was hoping you could update some of the lifetime bookings figure by product category. I think the last time we got some of these numbers from you, it was probably around the pre-spin Investor Day, and so are you, I guess, ready or prepared to sort of communicate what those lifetime bookings look like now?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. So, this is Liam. Good morning. At this point in time, we're not going to be providing color on lifetime bookings by product line. The level of granularity that we provided was what I commented on earlier which was, again, around $3 billion of lifetime bookings in the first quarter split pretty evenly across our two businesses, in internal combustion engine.","So, efficient fuel systems around GDi and fuel management. And then the other are split really with our electronics and electrification business. But again, it's a very \u2013 as you know Powertrain bookings tend to be very lumpy. So it would be \u2013 you can't take the $3 billion and multiply it by 4 and say that's the number that's going to be there for the year. It obviously depends on what's in the pipeline.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. So, I guess my final question then is, so the Aftermarket margin was up strongly year-over-year. I know you're going for up for the full year. But how should we think about the cadence for the rest of the year given this strong start?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Sure. We obviously have taken time to reflect on the Aftermarket, and we're very pleased with the performance in Q1. We took the strategic decision to target sort of higher-revenue channels, and we've made good progress in quarter 1 to that effect. We believe that we will have an uplift. So, we're not going to provide exact margin uplifts for the year. What I would say is that quarter 1 was certainly the highest in relation to the quarter, the 390 basis points. But we will expect to see a material uplift in relation to our operating margins for the full year.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. But that's consistent with what's in the plan.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Absolutely.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","We're delivering exactly what we communicated and what's in the plan for the year.","Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thanks.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys. Maybe if I could just follow up on that Aftermarket question. Is there a way that you can kind of sort of highlight that or talk to us just about the products that you're going after in the Aftermarket and what you're actually dropping off? I know it's kind of smaller in the grand scheme of the company, but it was a big contributor to the year-over-year increase in operating income.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. So, hi. Good morning. This is Liam. So, in terms of how we think about our Aftermarket business, so first of all, it's around 20% of the total revenue of the company. We're very happy with the business with the portfolio that we have, and it's very much focused on mandatory replacement parts that are really complementary to the Powertrain business that we have today. So, clearly, around fuel systems, fuel injectors, remanufacturing capability and also a number of, again, mandatory replacement parts that we have in the portfolio.","We've not been doing actively any major pruning or portfolio or adjustments. We've just been focusing very much more on the quality of pursuits, the quality of business in terms of margin expansion opportunities. Again, implementing the disciplined commercial strategy that we have across the business. And as Vivid explained before, we're seeing the margin expansion and that's really the primary focus, is to expand margins in that business, rather than pursuing market share with commodity-type products, that's not our strategy for that business.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","So, we're very much in line in Q1. We did talk about lower revenue for this year. And you saw our revenue coming in at 1%, but with margin expansion. So, we're on track in Q1.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just a second question on bookings. I understand they're lumpy, but you continue to kind of grow these. You've indicated you'll be higher year-over-year versus 2017. How much of this should we think about as sort of structural? As the automakers are required to invest in a myriad of things that they haven't in the past like autonomous and EV. And there might be just a very significant opportunity, not just from pure content in the vehicle going up, but for the potential for them to be outsourcing more of the R&D function in sort of these high value-added parts that you provide that will create some real upside to bookings over time. It's kind of hard to parse that but it seems like there's a trend to them relying to you on more and more on technology.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. That's a great question. So we don't see any shifts or changes from an OEM in terms of what they're outsourcing versus insourcing. The reason why our bookings and bookings rate has been accelerating is really a combination of a number of factors. One is we've been very, very focused in investing in the right technologies across our portfolio around again GDi, high pressure GDi systems, commercial vehicles, diesel, high pressure commercial vehicle and obviously in our electronics and software offerings. So that's really why we've been accelerating our bookings.","And then again, our commercial strategy is very much disciplined around which customers we want to work with or we're going to work aggressively with, who value our technology and that's the way we've been moving the business forward. So there's no real swing in terms of outsourcing and insourcing. And we don't see that neither in any of our \u2013 the products that we have in our \u2013 or the pursuits we have in the pipeline today, but even longer term in the spaces where we operate. We don't see any major changes in terms of what the OEMs are looking from Delphi Technologies.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And then just lastly, the negative mix, obviously is around light duty diesel. Sounds like a big weight this year, you've delineated that clearly. When do you think that eases? Are we kind of in the biggest step-down year, or is this the kind of thing we should think about for the next few years? What's kind of your view on that?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","So, from a light duty diesel, we expect this to carry on through till probably the end of 2020 is when we see the sort of the major impacts of light duty diesel. This is about a 200 basis point to 300 basis point headwind to our top line growth. This is around about $0.5 billion business and we expect that to flow through for the next at least a couple of years to get it down. We will still be left with some light duty diesel business that you saw today, our rest of world, outside of Europe business had a modest growth. So, we will continue to see some headwinds for the next two to three years.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. And that's pretty much in line with the plan that we've communicated. And as we said, the majority of the decline really that we see is more program roll-offs where we've got very good visibility of when the OEM is coming out of light duty diesel and transition into GDi, for example.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And could you just remind us the content potential on diesel versus GDi for you?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","So, rule of thumb is a GDi system is probably around 60% of the content of a diesel \u2013 of a fuel system on a diesel, light duty diesel.","John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS. Your line is now open.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on that, what is the assumption for diesel mix this year for the market that's based on your outlook and what was it in Q1, I think it was down like 800 basis points year-over-year, is that right?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yes. So, hi. Good morning. This is Liam. Maybe I'll provide some comments and Vivid, if you want to add some more color to it. So, the market was down around 750 basis points in Q1. The headwind for Delphi Technologies was around 200 basis points on our overall revenue numbers, but there's a lot of moving pieces to what's going on in the diesel space and really I think it's important to look a little bit below those headline numbers to understand what's going on.","The main decline that's happening in Europe in vehicle or diesel penetration is really in the sub 2 liter category. So, if you peel back the 750 basis points penetration, it's approximately 1,000 basis points reduction in the sub 2 liter and around 500 basis points in the above 2 liter category. So, we're seeing a lot of the OEMs really accelerating their transition out of the below 2 liter segment and transitioning to GDi and electrification.","So, it's a good reference point for us, and the relationship between market penetration, but really what's driving our revenue within light duty diesel, there's kind of three factors that are affecting Delphi Technologies. First is, as I said before, is program roll-offs where we've got very clear visibility of which programs are ending when throughout the year or over the next couple of years.","The second is our exposure to that European market decline and our exposure to the sub- and above 2 liter category. And just as a reference point, our revenue in the sub 2 liter category is significantly below around 5% of the total company revenue. So, it's a very small manageable amount.","And then, thirdly, is just the take of diesel passenger cars outside of Europe. So, some of the programs that are rolling off for example are being pushed into emerging markets where regulation requirements are not as enforced. So, in some cases that's kind of prolonging some of the revenue. And that's a long answer to your question but that's how we think about it, a lot of moving parts that are going on. And that's why, as I said, a little disconnect between IHS penetration versus our revenue numbers.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. That's very helpful. But you were talking 750 basis points for Q1. Your guidance or your headline is 200 basis point to 300 basis points. What number should we be thinking about in terms of the full year trend? Is that maybe that 200 basis point to 300 basis point, comes then (00:43:42) closer to 300 basis point? Are you thinking maybe (00:43:45)...","< : Yeah, we're confident, so again, we look regularly at our [ph] EDI (00:43:49) schedules from all of our customers. And we're comfortable with the guidance that we've given for light duty diesel kind of revenue impact of around 200 basis points for the year. But maybe, Vivid, you've got a little bit more color.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah, sure. As Liam said, there's a number of factors that sort of impact our light duty diesel. What's important to understand is that we've outlined approximately 200 basis points of headwind for this year. Within that, in the latest outlook that we've given, we actually have had an opportunity to relook at our European light duty diesel, and we've taken that down slightly based on some of the market declines that we've seen. And that's been offset by some of the rest of world, non-European side. So we've actually taken the opportunity to balance our light duty diesel assumptions and 200 basis points is where we believe we will finish this year in terms of headwind.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And that's like a 400 basis point, 500 basis point decline for the full year in Europe, that's sort of underlying assumptions?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","No. It remains within 200 basis points to 300 basis points. So the 200 basis points that we saw in quarter 1 remains in the 200 basis points to 300 basis points. So, we're within that range.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So the 200 basis points or 300 basis points is a Europe diesel assumption decline, or your top line sales \u2013 I'm not sure (00:45:11)","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Let me just maybe clarify, I'm not sure we're talking (00:45:13). Yeah, there's two numbers that are being discussed here. One is diesel penetration in Western Europe in Q1 was down 750 basis points. That was the penetration rate. Then we're talking about the 200 basis points headwind on our revenue in the light duty diesel space. We are sticking by the 200 basis points revenue impact for the full year. Clearly, IHS are publishing penetration rates for the rest of the year which are similar to what we've seen for Q1.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, got it.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","But clearly, our revenue is disconnected with the overall penetration rate for the three reasons that I explained.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Got it, okay. And then can you talk about commercial truck? Can you remind us what percent of your portfolio is commercial \u2013 obviously a big help in Q1? Is that also part of the reason why sales growth slows in Q2 because those comps got \u2013 in the second half of the year as comps get a little tougher? Or how should we be thinking about that?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yes. So, look, our commercial vehicle business is around 18% to 20% of our total revenue. And I'd say three main factors that have driven our growth in the first quarter. So, a number of new launches, especially in China where regulations have been very, very rigorously enforced which is transitioning the Chinese market to higher pressure fuel systems or common rail fuel systems, so those launches took place in Q1.","The second one is we still see strong demand from some of our core customers such as Volvo, DAF and Daimler and especially as they're growing in the North American market, very successful with their engine platforms. And then thirdly within our CV business, we're exposed to the off-highway, so customers such as Caterpillar and Cummins continue to have strong demand globally for the products that we supply. Mainly that's for electronics and software systems.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And as we think about going through the year, is it fair to think that the comps will get a little tougher (00:47:21)...","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. That's correct. Yes. We had a very strong second half last year with our commercial vehicle business. So, yeah, the comps will be tougher as we go through the year.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","And your assumption for the full year on commercial, just (00:47:34)","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","We've given a medium-term outlook, which is about 10% plus. So, that's the sort of medium term. We haven't given specific outlooks for commercial vehicles for this year.","Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for taking my question.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Just following up on that diesel versus gas both, I guess, injectors as well as rail systems. You mentioned the 60% content difference, a few questions. First, are you able to use the same factories, workforce and capital equipment to make gas systems as diesel systems, or is there a CapEx or a conversion cost involved with going from one to another.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","No, Brian. Hi, Brian. This is Liam. Good morning. Thanks for your question. Great question. So, if you look to Delphi Technologies in 2014, we had very much dedicated plants by product technology, and almost by customer. So, we had plants that were producing nothing but light duty diesel systems for one customer. Over the last four years, we've completely restructured, reorganized our footprints to process-based manufacturing plants. So, for example, our facility in Romania, we're very much focused on machining, high precision grinding, heat treatment across our entire portfolio for gasoline and diesel.","And also, as we've restructured our footprint, we've reutilized a lot of our machining equipment to cover our entire portfolio of products. So, we have significantly derisked the business from any declines, from one specific part of the market.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And so, if you look at the impact in your kind of directional EBIT lock from mix, the revenue lower would be (00:49:39) on the revenue side. It seems like, and I know you've said this in the past, that GDi comes in at a bit lower margin than diesel systems, is that correct? And does that change over time? Or is it just something about the structure of the two markets, in terms of where the relative price\/profit positions are.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Brian, this is Vivid here. No. You're absolutely right. So, there are two parts of our business that are not at company average margins at the moment. And that's GDi and Power Electronics. So, this is very much around scale and investment that we put into both businesses. So, GDi, we expect them to be at about breakeven, at about sort of $300 million to $400 million and we expect them to be at about company average, somewhere between $700 million and $800 million worth of revenue.","So obviously, that would imply today, that GDi is close to breakeven in where we are and we'll probably get to company averages at around 2020, when we ramp up in terms of our revenues. Power Electronics, we see that getting to sort of company averages a few years after that, outside of the 2020 range. So, both today are below company averages, but as you've seen from the trajectory on both of those, in terms of revenue, we expect them to get to company average margins in line with our expectations.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So, there isn't anything \u2013 as the third and final question, Daimler, I believe talked to a couple of quarters about the need to support some of the suppliers in their transition from diesel to other powertrains. I don't think they were talking about you, my guess is Bosch. If you have competitors who have stranded capacity, are you seeing any \u2013 is that true and are you seeing anything in terms of pricing on programs that would cause you to worry?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Right. So, Brian, this is Liam. So, in terms of maybe \u2013 so, first, if Daimler are offering help to suppliers, we would be more than happy to listen to what the hell they're offering. But in terms of our light duty diesel strategy, so back in 2014, we actually stopped pursuing light duty diesel programs, because even at that point in time, there were commercial practices that made no sense to us financially to pursue those part of the business.","If I look at where we are today in terms of GDi and the growth that we've got with our GDi portfolio, we don't see any major different commercial behavior across our entire portfolio. We remain very disciplined in terms of the pursuits we go after. And clearly it's around making sure we've got the right technology in place, we bring the right value to our customer. We're not just selling underutilized capacity. That's not part of our strategy and never will be.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And do you know if your competitors are flexible between gas and diesel injection manufacturing and rail manufacturing capability, or do they have kind of dedicated plants and are behind you in that transition?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","To be honest, Brian, not really. No, I'm not that aware in terms of our competitor's footprint. We focus really primarily on our own footprint and technology development.","Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Following up on some of the questions on operating margin. It wasn't clear. You raised the guidance for your operating margin this year, but it didn't sound like it was being driven solely by the FX because you think that's supposed to even out for the full year. So, was there a core fundamental driver for the operating margin guidance range?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","So, in terms of our margin, we took it up 10 basis points in relation to the bottom and top end of it. It was really driven mostly by FX in terms of our portfolio. Really, our growth is being driven by FX. There were some performance in there, and obviously Aftermarket has been relatively strong, and that's offsetting today engineering and some incremental cost in terms of the commodities that we've also raised. So, really, FX is driving a large portion of that with operational performance offsetting some of the commodity exposure that we've seen.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then as we think about it just by segment, are you anticipating that you're going to have similar performance year-over-year with margin expansion in the Aftermarket continuing and likewise similar margin cadence or similar margin performance for the Powertrain segment for the balance of the year?","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","So, we don't really comment by individual business unit in terms of margin performance. We have spoken about getting back to pre-spin margins by 2020, which would imply approximately 130 basis points to 140 basis points of margin expansion. This is a choice that we will evaluate. But right now, we see a very clear pathway to returning to that, and that will come from contributions both within Aftermarket and the Powertrain segments.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And then just lastly with pricing in the quarter, I think it equates to about 1.5% maybe 1.4% price down. Correct me, if I'm wrong, but I think the guidance for maybe 1.5% to 2%. Is there anything particularly driving higher price down in the balance of the year? Is it somewhat attributable to product mix, or is it just different pricing by segment and again different mix of revenue coming through?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. It tends to be up and down. A lot of our annual contracts kick in January 1, but it varies throughout the year. So, I wouldn't draw any conclusions from the 1.4% in Q1 and we stand by the 1.5% to 2% for the full year.","David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Wonderful. Thank you very much, gentlemen.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys. Very impressive bookings in the quarter. Two questions. One on the ICE and one on Power Electronics. I guess on more of the traditional business, one of the questions that we're hearing across the industry is about powertrain standardization for VW. How do you think that will start to affect the legacy businesses which are growing? Does it end up being a positive for Delphi? Are you seeing it in the orders and just any qualitative information you can give around that would be great?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yes. So this is Liam. So, no, we don't see any major trends around \u2013 I'm assuming you're referring to kind of standardization across powertrain platforms between OEMs. We don't see any of that taking place at this point in time. Our bookings were very strong with GDi for example in the first quarter and our products are very much engineered, developed, and customized, and calibrated according to any specific OEM's requirements especially in terms of the software and how we calibrate our injection technology. So, we don't see any kind of cross developments across different OEMs.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","No. But Liam, I also mean maybe just less variance within specific OEMs rather than offering 30 different types of Powertrain options, if that's...","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Sorry. Yes.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Yeah.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Absolutely. Yes. So, one of the big programs that we booked in Q1 was for a global OEM for their next-generation of engine platform. And the volumes on that platform are substantially higher than on the prior platform because they've consolidated \u2013 you could say, for example, a 1.2 and a 1.1 have all consolidated to a 1.4. I don't know, 1.6, 1.5 have consolidated to a 1.6 engine. So yes, we do see less variance across the engine platforms within the OEMs. So, that's fair.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Okay, great. And just with \u2013 on Power Electronics, obviously it's so impressive. You're booking $2 billion per year, it sounds like it's a gigantic number in Q1, even if it's lumpy. Just help us, what are we missing in terms of \u2013 if we're booking $2 billion per year, right, and I know it's a bunch of different programs, but if, let's say it's $2 billion a year, another two years, with a four or five-year sort of difference between orders and production, you would think by maybe 2022, 2023, that you could almost have $2 billion in revenue. But I think some of the guidance you've discussed is around $700 million or $800 million. Could you just help us bridge that difference, because it's such an important growth driver for the company.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. It's Vivid here. In terms of our Power Electronics, we've obviously had some strong growth, both in 2017 and in Q1 2018. We've given a medium-term outlook, that we expect Power Electronics to be growing about 35% a year and that was given last year. So, we continue to see strong growth and investment in that.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. And maybe just to add a bit more color. So, the bookings that we are making, especially in Q1, those programs are launching starting 2021 and beyond. And one of the things that we are seeing on Power Electronics is this is not kind of board-in-a-box technology. This is very, very complicated technology that's been packaged in all sorts of different areas and locations on the vehicle and also the software systems and software capabilities required to integrate with the vehicle platforms. The time from booking to vehicle launch, we're seeing that being a little bit pushed further out than we would on say a typical fuel system. So, 2021 to 2022, 2023 is where we really start to see acceleration in the numbers.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's great. So, essentially, if it takes a little bit longer than the four to five years, a continued $2 billion in bookings maybe it's not 2023 but 2024, 2025. The number obviously would get pretty big, pretty quick anyway at 30%, 45% growth rates.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","It would be a fair assumption, yes.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. But our growth rates we took out were till 2020.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yes.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","So, just to be clear.","Chris McNally - Evercore ISI","Perfect. Thank you so much, guys.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","No problem. Thank you.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I know before you commented on potential industry consolidation and your expertise in attracting synergies from previous transactions you've been involved with. Perhaps you can update us, as you talked about the leverage and the share buyback program here, your capital allocation philosophy and how that translates to your thoughts on acquisition?","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yes, so maybe I just give a few comments and maybe Vivid can comment a little bit on capital allocation. But in terms of where we are as a business since we spun out at Delphi, clearly, a lot of discussion around industry consolidation. If I look at the company where we are today in terms of the portfolio of technology, our mix of customers and our geographic reach, we may remain even more convinced now that this company is in a fantastic position from a technology and portfolio standpoint.","We don't need to make any specific acquisitions to fill a capability gap that we don't have or to penetrate a new area that we're not in today. So, the way that we think about acquisitions is really about how can we have nice bolt-on acquisitions that can widen the technology moat in certain parts of our portfolio. And clearly, Power Electronics is an area of interest for us, but we have some great technology there already today. So, it's Power Electronics but it's also in our other parts of our business, in fuel systems or anything that can bring more efficient fuel, fuel systems, fuel management to our customers.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","And just in terms of capital allocation itself, we're still a relatively new standalone company, and our absolute priority this year is to ensure that we execute on our target and position this company for long-term growth. Liam has already spoken about the great bookings momentum we had in Q1 and last year, and we're going to continue to invest in the business.","And our business is a relatively strong cash flow characteristic business, and we're going to take the opportunity to further strengthen our balance sheet, and we're targeting the leverage ratio of about 1.5 times this year. We think that's important because it's going to give us further optionality going forward to either support the future growth through continued organic means or through M&A activities with bolt-on technologies to add to our business. But shareholder return is going to be an important part of our portfolio.","We've already announced our Q1 dividend at $0.17 and we've also mentioned that we're going to grow the dividend in line with cash flow going forward. And going ahead, we haven't taken share repurchase off the table either. That remains an important part of our capital allocation strategy. Just right now our focus is going to be on implementing growth and hitting our targets for this year.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And when I think about bolt-on acquisitions for Power Electronics, you're not the only one talking about this. So maybe you can talk about the M&A landscape there, how competitive the processes are and just the availability of Power Electronics asset to the market.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. So, we continue to look very closely at what's going on in the market. And in terms of the landscape of Power Electronics, you're right, there's a lot of activity out there. But as I said before, we have a fantastic portfolio of technology and capability. I'm not lacking anything that we don't desperately need something from a technology or product standpoint to complement our portfolio. And we continue to look and see what's out there in the market.","And I think the confirmation of the technology that we have and the fact we don't need to make an acquisition is really \u2013 if you look at our bookings performance last year and the pipeline of pursuits that we have is incredibly strong.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. And I think this is an important part of our business. I mean, before the spin, M&A was not the focus of this business. And as Liam said, we have everything in the pipeline that we need to hit our targets and to grow successfully.","But now, we are going to take the opportunity to look, we're adding capabilities within the company. So, we're actually bringing additional resources to review that. So, I think what's really good for Delphi Technologies is we have the pathway to deliver our targets, but also we have the optionality to review and look at opportunities that's maybe out there, and we're going to enhance that.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Yeah. And just I don't want to go on too much about it. But just to confirm, we are not going to go out and do some crazy non-value acquisitions because it's something that we need to do. We're not in that position where we desperately need to do something.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Much appreciated. Congratulations.","Vivid Seghal - Delphi Technologies Plc","Okay.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back to Liam Butterworth for any further remarks.","Liam Butterworth - Delphi Technologies Plc","Okay. So, thank you very much, everybody, for joining us on today's call. I think as we've shown you today, we had a great start to the year, and I look forward to updating on our progress at our next earnings call.

With me today in London is our Chief Executive Officer, Liam Butterworth, our Chief Financial Officer, Vivid Sehgal as well as our Chief Technology Officer, Mary Gustanski.","This call include a discussion of our Q4 and full year 2017 financial results as disclosed in today\u2019s press release as well as our outlook for 2018. In order to follow along with today\u2019s presentation, you can find an accompanying set of slides on our investor relations website at ir.delphi.com.","Please note that our discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the tables within our press release.","Now before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements.

Thank you for joining us today for our first quarterly earnings call as Delphi Technologies. Before I provide an update on progress we have made on our strategy and share my perspective for 2018, I want to share with you some of the highlights from 2017. We had a tremendous year, delivering on our commitments with strong 8.5% year-on-year revenue growth and 180 basis points of margin expansion. In addition, there were other significant accomplishments across the business. ","We had record bookings of $7.1 billion, including significant electrification wins, positioning us well for long-term growth. We flawlessly completed the separation of our business ahead of schedule, showing our strong execution capability, enabling us to commence 2018 as a fully operational independent company. I was especially pleased with our bookings performance in 2017, which is a clear reflection of our customers\u2019 recognition of the technologies we provide. We had strong performance in all our areas of strategic focus. ","And in addition, we launched more than 90 programs in the year, well balanced across our portfolio, regions and customer base. We concluded 2017 with a strong balance sheet and liquidity profile, which allows us to continue to reinvest in the business to drive long term growth and maintain a balanced approach to capital allocation. In summary, we continued to deliver in line with our commitments, while executing the spin on laying the foundations for future success. Vivid will take you through the details of our 2018 outlook, but at a high level, we expect another year of growth and margin expansion and we remain confident in returning to our pre-spin margin levels by 2020.","As I said, we are now fully operational, having flawlessly executed the spin. The response from customers, suppliers and employees has been extremely positive. We are now laser focused on coming off the transition service agreements in a timely and cost effective manner, while continuing to invest in building our own standalone functional capabilities. We have an outstanding leadership team in place and a highly experienced and supportive board of directors. Now, the organization is fully focused on delivering our commitments for 2018 and beyond.","One of the many highlights of the year has been our bookings performance. Here, you can see our bookings growth trajectory, which fully reflects our disciplined commercial strategy. This continues to serve us well and showing that we maintain balance growth across regions, customers and core technologies. In 2017, we saw acceleration in electrification bookings with almost $2 billion in lifetime revenue. Bookings were also strong for fuel efficient solutions for internal combustion engines across passenger car and commercial vehicle applications.","This clearly underscores the strength of our balanced portfolio and depth of our technical expertise across the full spectrum of propulsion systems. In particular, our proven expertise in power electronics design, development, software and systems engineering continues to uniquely position us to capture significant incremental content per vehicle and our extensive track record on differentiating technology is clearly highly valued by our customers in assisting them in their path to electrification. Our DNA of a rigorous and disciplined commercial strategy will continue through 2018 where we fully expect to further grow bookings in our core leading technologies.","As this is our first results as a listed company, I wanted to take a moment to outline our vision. Our primary goal and commitment is to create value. Everything we do every day in this company is fully aligned towards our objective. It is with this goal in mind that our technologies are obsessed with developing pioneering solutions for today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s propulsion systems. Whether it is a combustion, hybrid or electric vehicle, we are committed to ensure that the driver has a very best driving experience, while the vehicle operates more efficiently and cleanly.","Before moving more into the detail of 2017 and outlook for 2018, I would like to outline the main elements of our strategy. Our portfolio sits at the heart of our strategy. In the dynamic markets we operate in, it is imperative that we have the right products, technologies and services to meet the needs of our customers. We continually work to strengthen our portfolio on the broader business by focusing on three key strategic levers that have really served us well over the last four years and we\u2019ll continue to do so in the future.","The first lever is technology and innovation. This is how we develop and expand our portfolio. The second is our focus on execution, which allows us to competitively launch and deliver our products and services to customers. And thirdly, our emphasis on value creation across our entire business drives our commercial and capital allocation approach.","I\u2019ll now take you through some examples of these and a bit more starting on slide 8. We have a deep rooted culture of excellence in innovation and engineering. Our customers consistently depend on us to innovate and deliver to solve their complex problems in vehicle propulsion. I want to highlight a few examples across our portfolio that demonstrate how this makes a difference, starting with our power electronics technology.","2017 was a major milestone year for our power electronics business in terms of product shipped, bookings, technology advancements and capacity expansion. As an example, volumes substantially increased on our combined inverter and DC\/DC converters with BMW, Ford, GM and especially Volvo for their T8 platform, which encompasses XC and V range of cars and SUVs. The program ran so flawlessly during 2017 and we've also secured an expanded scope of applications across most of the related GD platforms.","Our CIDD inverter with Viper switch technology is a great example of our innovation and engineering capabilities. It is smaller, lighter and have superior thermal properties to help meet packaging challenges, whilst also managing the higher power levels needed across the spectrum of hybrid technologies and full electric vehicles. Also at the start of 2018, we announced an equity investment in PolyCharge, which will further differentiate our technology.","The second example I want to highlight is our leading fuel systems technology for combustion engines. We were the first to market with our 350-bar gas direct injection solution shown here for Volkswagen. First launched in China, it has been gaining strong praise from many major OEMs, resulting in significant bookings over the course of 2017 and already continuing the momentum in 2018.","In addition, our innovation has gained industry recognition with our GDI solution being named as the 2018 PACE Award finalist. In simple terms, our 350-bar GDI system reduces particular market by 70%. This helps our customers meet the more stringent Euro 6d regulations in compliance with the latest real world testing protocols. ","And finally on the right hand side of the slide, we have a great example of innovation in the commercial vehicle segment with our long term partner DAF PACCAR. We supplied DAF PACCAR with our latest Euro 6 ultra-high pressure fuel system, contributing to a 7% fuel efficiency improvement across their fleet of heavy duty trucks. We also supply the same technology to Volvo, Hyundai and Daimler truck.","Additionally, I\u2019d like to comment on our aftermarket business, which has delivered above market growth last year and where we've been focusing on aligning our portfolio and global distributions footprint. Our theme has been reinforced and is now focused on supporting distributors and installers with products, solutions and services to support the latest vehicle technologies.","Now, I want to move on to execution. We\u2019re in line with our DNA. We remain laser focused on our footprint, flawless launch and our obsession for operational excellence. We've been diligently rotating our footprint for the past four years with the objective of aligning with our strategy, customers and industry dynamics. And we\u2019re now in a position where we have a world class footprint that is significantly more efficient and flexible.","Starting in 2014, we began to proactively rotate our footprint away from light duty diesel to advanced gasoline solutions, mitigating the headwinds we see in the market today. In addition, we localized capacity in China to the medium and heavy duty diesel markets, doubling our production in 2017. This enables us to capture the higher content opportunity, which has been driven by the enforcement of CN5 and CN6 emissions regulations. ","We also recently broke ground in China for a major capacity expansion for our electronics and electrification business that will come on stream during 2018. And as a result, we expect revenue for our power electronics product family to increase by over 50% versus 2017. I\u2019ve already referred to our launch pipeline where our team around the world would be laser focused on flawlessly launching more than 120 programs in 2018. And finally, we relentlessly continue our journey to leverage our enterprise operating system, which has been the foundation of our manufacturing strategy with a focus on safety, cost, quality and efficiency.","Moving to slide 10, value creation, our focus on innovation and execution is grounded on our fundamental principle of creating value. As I previously mentioned, we've taken a very deliberate approach to balancing our business by products, customer, market and region. And this remains an important element to our value creation philosophy. This balance combined with our operating model allows us to adapt our business to change the market dynamics such as the light duty diesel decline, regulatory driven demand for cleaner and more efficient vehicles and the ongoing transition to electrification.","As Vivid will highlight, improving our cash flow performance is a priority for us. We ended 2017 with a strong foundation for future cash flow generation and we have a clear line of sight to delivering significantly higher cash flow as we roll off spin related costs and return to more normalized levels of CapEx and restructuring. We will continue to have a balanced approach to how we deploy our capital in the future, reinvest in organic growth, value enhancing M&A and shareholder returns. And consistent with that approach, our board recently approved our first quarterly post-spin dividend.","So before I hand over to Vivid, let me summarize. 2017 was a milestone year for us. We successfully executed the spin, while delivering strong growth, margin expansion and record bookings. Looking into 2018, we are focused on executing the strategy I laid out and delivering our commitments to drive long term value. Our market continues to be driven by regulations and our customers are increasingly depending on us to support them in meeting their future propulsion system challenges.","So in conclusion, we feel great about where we are as a company and are well positioned in an attractive market. We have an amazing team, the right strategy and market leading technologies that will enable us to deliver on our 2018 commitments.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Vivid to take you through the financials in more detail and our outlook for 2018.","Vivid Sehgal","Thank you, Liam and good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. As Liam outlined, we had a tremendous year and I'll start with a high level recap of our full-year financials, which you can see on slide 13. Given that we completed our separation in December, we have presented our full-year 2017 results on both a reported and adjusted basis. But just to explain the difference.","Our reported results reflect 11 months performance of the power train segment of Delphi Automotive plus one month standalone December results as Delphi Technologies. Our adjusted results reflect 12 months performance as the power train segment of Delphi Automotive, which is directly comparable to the full year 2016 results, presented in the third column. The difference between the reported and adjusted results reflect two pro forma adjustments for the month of December.","First, a portion of aftermarket revenue that was transferred to Aptiv as part of the separation agreement. And second, spin related and public company cost for the month of December. Adjusted revenue of $4.85 billion, up 8.5% year-on-year and operating income of $641 million, up 25% year-on-year were driven by a continuation of the trends we have seen across our business and especially in the power train systems.","Adjusted operating margin of 13.2%, an increase of 180 basis points year-on-year was primarily driven by strong volume flow through and the benefits of prior restructuring. On the right hand side of the slide, we have provided pro forma financial highlights for the full year 2017, which reflect the two adjustments I just referenced, but on a full year basis. Our pro forma revenue was $4.77 billion and our pro forma operating income was $569 million or 11.9% operating margins.","Relative to our adjusted results, you can calculate that the pro forma impacts being $81 million of revenue and $72 million of operating income. This walks you from the 13.2% adjusted operating margin to the 11.9% pro forma margin you see on the right hand side of this slide. To be clear, these pro forma figures of $4.77 billion of revenue and the 11.9% of operating margin are the right comparison points for our 2018 outlook. Operating cash flow of $389 million was in line with expectations. And finally, we closed 2017 with a total cash balance of $338 million and an operating cash balance of $266 million.","Turning to slide 14, we had a very busy Q4, preparing and completing the spin, while continuing to execute on launch activities and pursuits. Adjust Q4 revenue of $1.3 billion was up 8.7% year-on-year. The left hand side of the slide walks through our year-on-year revenue growth for the quarter. Underlying global vehicle production of around 1% was slightly better than expected. We also had a strong growth across our portfolio. GDI and commercial vehicle revenues were both up approximately 40% year-on-year. Power electronics revenues increased by approximately 20%. In addition, we saw favorable foreign exchange movements, primarily related to the Euro.","Price concessions were slightly lower than expected in the quarter. From a regional perspective, our strong revenue performance was driven by growth in all of our regions and especially in China where we saw growth of more than 20% year-on-year. Slide 15 walks you through our operating income growth for Q4. Adjusted operating income was $168 million in Q4, up 26% year-on-year, resulting in 140 basis points of margin expansion. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by revenue growth and strong operational performance as well as foreign exchange benefits.","As a new independent company, we have two reportable segments, power train systems and aftermarket. Slide 16 gives you an overview of each segment. Starting with power train systems, which offers a comprehensive portfolio of innovative technologies for both passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Moving to the right hand side of the chart, aftermarket [indiscernible] replacement products to independent and original equipment service customers. One important dynamic to highlight is that a portion of power train revenues are sold through the aftermarket business. At a total company level, these internal sales are eliminated and are disclosed in the financial tables on page 10 of today's press release.","Moving to slide 17, power train systems revenue grew 9.7% in the quarter, consistent with its full year performance. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by strong performance in GDI, commercial vehicle and power electronics, partially offset by the expected decline in light duty diesel revenues, which fell by approximately 11% versus the prior quarter. Adjusted operating margin of 13.1% for the quarter was up 210 basis points. For the full year, adjusted operating margin was 13.4%, which increased 250 basis points year-on-year.","Both on a Q4 and full year basis, our margin expansion was primarily driven by strong material and manufacturing performance, the benefits of prior restructuring efforts and foreign exchange tailwinds. We believe power train systems is well positioned to deliver long-term growth, supported by strong bookings performance that Liam referenced, our ongoing focus on innovation and operational excellence and by leveraging our industry leading cost structure.","Turning to our aftermarket segment on the next slide, adjusted revenue of $255 million increased by 3.8% in Q4. On a full year basis, after market adjusted revenues were up 6.2%. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong sales to the OES channel and to a lesser extent by growth in the independent aftermarket channel. From a regional perspective, we saw growth across all regions, with the exception of North America where growth was impacted by lower sales at both OES and independent aftermarket customers.","Turning to operating income, at the beginning of 2017, we modified our internal transfer pricing model between power train and aftermarket. This adversely impacted the year-on-year operating income growth and margin performance of the aftermarket segment, but had a corresponding but relatively smaller positive impact on the power train segment margin. Excluding this, which of course has no impact on our overall company results, the underlying operating margins aftermarket was 9.8% in Q4 and 9.3% for the full-year. You can see this on the right hand side of slide 18.","The underlying decline of 120 basis points in the quarter was primarily driven by unfavorable products. As we look into 2018, we are focusing on higher margin revenue opportunities in order to drive operating leverage and return margins closer to the company average.","Now, let's move on to our expectations for 2018. Slide 19 outlines our outlook for the year. At a high level, our outlook underscores our confidence in the pathway to returning to pre-spin operating margin levels by 2020 while significantly improving our cash flows. I\u2019ll come back to this on the next slide. For 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion. Relative to the revenue growth that we delivered in 2017, our outlook assumes first approximately a 200 basis point headwind to our top line from the expected decline in our light duty diesel business, which is split roughly two-third to one-third between the rollout of certain passenger car programs that are coming to end of life and lower diesel market penetration, especially in Europe. ","Second, lower growth for the aftermarket segment as a result of our decision to focus on higher margin channels. Third, we expect GDI and commercial vehicle to deliver another year of robust growth, but not at the elevated levels of 2017, which benefited from a significant uplift in content growth due to the ongoing transitions from PFI to GDI in passenger car and Euro 5 to Euro 6 in commercial vehicles.","And finally, as Liam referenced, we expect our power electronics business to see more than 50% growth in 2018. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the 12.2% to 12.4% range, up 30 to 50 basis points from our pro forma 2017 margin levels of 11.9%. This margin outlook includes approximately $17 million of spin related in company cost, which we will start to roll off aggressively in 2019 and beyond.","In terms of the key drivers of our expected margin expansion in 2018, I would like to highlight the following. Positive drivers include ongoing benefits from prior restructuring efforts and material and manufacturing cost improvements, part of the Delphi Technologies DNA. This is expected to be partially offset by price concessions in the region of 1.5% to 2%, incremental R&D spend to drive long-term growth and a modest negative mix impact driven by higher sales of power electronics and GDI. ","And for adjusted EPS, our outlook calls for earnings per share in the range of $4.50 to $4.80. Please note that our 2018 outlook assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of $1.15. Driving improved cash flow performance is a priority of Delphi Technologies. For 2018, we\u2019re expected to deliver operating cash flow in the range of $440 million to $480 million. We are focused on generating operating cash flow in the region of $700 million by 2020 and we have a good line of sight towards reaching that goal. For 2018, our cash flow performance is expected to be impacted by $75 million to $80 million of one-time separation costs, $95 million to $100 million of restructuring charges and elevated CapEx in the range of $280 million to $300 million due to separation activities.","Looking beyond 2018, there is a clear opportunity to significantly improve our cash flow performance by rolling off the spin related and separation costs over the next two or three years, reducing annual cash restructuring charges and returning CapEx to a more normalized level of around 5% of sales. While we are not providing a specific quarterly outlook, I wanted to provide you with some color on how we see our phasing through the year.","Starting with revenue, we expect to see stronger growth in the first half of the year, driven in part by the rate of decline in our light duty diesel business, which is expected to accelerate over the course of 208. In addition, our aftermarket revenue growth assumptions are more weighted towards the first half of 2018. And in line with historical trends, we expect the first and the third quarters to be the lightest in terms of adjusted operating profit and hence of our adjusted EPS. Finally, we expect engineering spend as a percentage of sales to be the highest in the first quarter, primarily due to the timing of spend to support customer programs.","On slide 20, we have sketched out our longer term margin framework, layering in our 2017 performance and our outlook for 2018. On the left hand side, you can see our starting point. The adjusted pro forma operating margin for 2017 which came in at 11.9%. As you move to the middle, you can see our margin outlook for 2018, which assumes 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion. And moving to the right, you can see that we are continuing to target 140 basis points of margin improvement by 2020 from the 11.9% in 2017. As we continue to gain leverage from the revenue growth and realize the roll-off of spin related and efficiencies. And as I mentioned earlier, we also believe we can significantly improve our cash flow performance.","Before turning the call back for your questions, I wanted to share some perspective on our balanced approach to capital allocation. We closed 2017 with more than $330 million in total cash, which is a good basis for future capital allocation decisions. In January, our Board of Directors approved our first quarterly post-spin dividend, and we also announced an equity investment in PolyCharge to further differentiate our power electronics portfolio.","Looking ahead, our capital allocation framework starts with investments in our base business and to a lesser extent restructuring initiatives to drive long-term organic growth. Our previous portfolio of choices and investments to support organic growth has resulted in strong bookings momentum and has significantly improved our cost structure, an approach we intend to maintain going forward. And while organic growth remains our focus for 2018, we continue to have a selective approach to potential M&A opportunities as a way to further drive shareholder value.","So in closing, we had a great 2017, delivering strong growth, margin expansion and ended the year with an improved cash balance. Our strategy of profitable growth through organic investments remains our priority. And as our 2018 outlook demonstrates, we are squarely on the pathway to returning to our pre-spin operating margin while significantly improving our cash flows.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Leiker of Baird.","David Leiker","I wanted to talk a little bit, trying to figure out what slide it was you're talking about, some of the things you're doing in terms of new technologies, new investments and try and put some scale on some of these. If we take a look at your bookings that you did for the year, what share of those do you think are coming from some of these newer technologies, GDI, the next generation commercial vehicle emissions, hybrids, electrics versus a more traditional gasoline diesel business.","Liam Butterworth","Yes. So David, let me maybe add a few comments to that and I think, first of all, we declared or we announced that we have got over $2 billion of bookings in power electronics and really the overall approach or philosophy in what\u2019s been driving our commercial team and engineering teams is to focus on core products and technology in our portfolio. So the remainder of our bookings for last year were really across the spectrum of fuel systems for GDI, for commercial vehicle, heavy duty diesel systems and also for electronic controllers and some other smaller products in our portfolio. But we remain focused really on those three main areas of our business.","David Leiker","And you think that's most of what you're bookings were last year or in those products?","Liam Butterworth","Yeah. That's the majority of where our bookings are and that's where we're spending the majority of our R&D in terms of future technology developments and how we\u2019re steering the business going forward.","David Leiker","And then the other part of that is if you take a look on those newer technologies versus some of the more traditional technologies, where do you think your win rate is on that and where your market share might be shaking up relative to what you would have had in the current technologies?","Liam Butterworth","Yes. So in terms of win rates, David, I would say that if we look at Conquest business, it's probably in the kind of mid-40s, mid to high 40s. And then incumbent business is probably well over 80% in terms of the incumbent pursuits. In terms of market share, we\u2019re not market chasers is what we do \u2013 obviously, our priority is to focus on maximizing our technology and maximizing growth and value for the business. So we're not specifically hung up on chasing certain market share numbers, but I think one of the slides we shared with you with our GDI business, clearly, we have a very strong position that's growing and we were first to market in globally with our 350-bar GDI solution and that business clearly has been growing strongly in \u201917 and will continue to do so as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Lim of Wells Fargo.","David Lim","Just quickly on that 50% power electronics growth for 2018, can you give us some additional color like who may be the OEMs or is it global or is it more regionalized to one specific region, that would be helpful.","Liam Butterworth","It's pretty much across the board. As I said on my script, with supply in BMW, Volvo, Ford and GM and we're seeing strong pull across our entire portfolio of power electronics and the main regions where we\u2019re supplying is in Europe and clearly as we said, we've been implementing more capacity in China. So we're seeing a strong ramp in China as well as we go through 2018. And clearly, we continue discussions with those customers regarding installed capacity and what that rates are going to be.","David Lim","And then this morning Daimler announced something about [indiscernible]. In the situation where you're getting these within the major metropolitan areas in Europe switching to more hybridization as well as fully electric, how does that help your content? And then I have one other follow-up?","Liam Butterworth","Yes. So maybe I'll give a couple of high level comments on that and then I might just ask Mary to remark. But in terms of electrification in the medium and heavy duty space, clearly, there are opportunities for further growth in the content per vehicle using our power electronics, specifically around our Viper technology, really gives us an opportunity for a big uplift in content per vehicle.","Maybe, Mary, do you want to add a couple of?","Mary Gustanski","Yeah. I think what I would add to that Liam basically in a truck application or commercial vehicle application, you need more of the technology that we supply enhances your vehicle. So the way to think about it is rough numbers about three times the content opportunity as what we have in passenger vehicle for commercial vehicle. It's more power, more higher voltages and that's really what they're after. And for sure, every commercial vehicle customer that we talk to is focused on how do they use electrification wisely for the future.","David Lim","And then finally Liam, if you could give us some idea, China was really or Asia Pacific was really, really strong. Can you give us some idea that you\u2019ve launched the GDI over there, but are there any other product groups that is particularly gaining traction?","Liam Butterworth","Yeah. So one of the comments I made, with our medium duty and heavy duty diesel business, clearly, that market's been going through a transition as the emissions regulations start to become enforced, which is basically forcing the commercial vehicle market to move from traditional rotary technology to high pressure fuel systems, so that\u2019s giving us a significant content uplift and it\u2019s really those regulations are enforced, we've been gaining a lot of traction in \u201917 and we see that continuing in \u201918 really as our fuel systems become implemented.","And then in addition, again, our power electronics, we've implemented more capacity in China. We broke ground on our new facility very recently and that will be ramping throughout the course of 2018.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.","Rod Lache","Had a couple of questions. One is you talked about 4% organic growth for this year. Based on the bookings that you see coming through, can you talk about how the cadence of backlog starts to filter in in 2019 and 2020. It sounds like there are a number of significant power train programs that launched in that timeframe with GM launching DSF and their large trucks.","Liam Butterworth","Yes. I\u2019d say at a high level, if you look at our bookings trajectory from \u201914 through to \u201917, we've gone from around mid-4.7 billion lifetime revenue to over 7 billion. And then from a growth standpoint, we\u2019ve said that \u201918 and \u201919 will clearly be transition years as we get through the light duty diesel headwinds. And then from \u201919 onwards, we really start to see the, our GDI business getting -- taking hold, so much stronger revenues of GDI and also power electronics and continuing to grow again with our commercial vehicle business specifically in Asia Pacific. So I\u2019d say those three elements to get traction and obviously as we've burned through the light duty diesel headwind, we will see growth accelerate in \u201919 and beyond.","Rod Lache","The net backlog of new business is similar in \u201919 versus what you see this year. Is that correct?","Liam Butterworth","Yeah. I think maybe, well, we might need to just follow-up with you on that point, just to understand the methodology around that backlog.","Rod Lache","And I had a couple of housekeeping questions. It looks like if I take -- if I look at the FX impact, $13 million from slide 15 on $51 million of revenue change, it looks like a 25% margin impact on FX. Am I misinterpreting that or is that correct?","Vivid Sehgal","Rod, it\u2019s Vivid here. The way to look at it is for every cent of the dollar euro moves, it\u2019s about $15 million of revenue for us, which equates to about $3 billion on operating income basis. So, we do have a range of currencies that are there, but yeah, we've certainly seen strength in relation to the dollar right now.","Rod Lache","And you\u2019re at 115 in your assumptions. And just two other quick housekeeping ones. Can you tell us what magnitude of restructuring benefit you've incorporated in 2018 versus 2017? And then lastly, the guidance that you gave on slide 19. I just want to confirm the margin is net of one-time separation costs, but it excludes restructuring of about 100 million. Is that correct?","Vivid Sehgal","Yes. So let me answer both of those, Rod. So in terms of the net benefit of restructuring in 2018, it's a similar impact that we had in 2017, the main driver of our margin expansion is actually from the continuation of the manufacturing and the material efficiency gains that we've got. But yet, the numbers are relatively similar in both years.","In terms of the -- how we got through the adjusted margin, if you look at it from -- there are really -- there is what is being excluded is one-time separation costs of around about the sort of $70 million mark and then restructuring in the 95 million to 100 million range. What we have included in the adjusted numbers is the public company and we called it efficiencies, which are around about the $70 million mark as well.","Rod Lache","So on the right, you've got -- I'm at slide 19, you say one-time separation costs of 75 to 80, restructuring charges of 95 to 100. Those are both excluded, but you do that 70 million of \u2013 coincidentally, it's also in the 70 in efficiencies.","Vivid Sehgal","Correct. Yes. And that\u2019s the numbers that we talked about in terms of setting ourselves up from a public company across the TSAs and the \u2013","Liam Butterworth","Yeah. It's just a coincidence, Rod. It\u2019s the same number.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Murphy of Bank of America.","John Murphy","Just maybe a sort of a follow-up on the two David's questions at the beginning. The power electronics business, can you give us just a rough number on what the revenue is in 2018 and what you think that one should be on a dollar basis? And when we think about, not just the backlog that David was asking about, but really the 120 launches that you're talking about in 2018, sort of the mix between gas, diesel and anything that we\u2019d have to do with EVs, whether it be power electronics or other products, is there kind of a mix in these new launches for 2018 you can highlight to us?","Liam Butterworth","Yeah, if I take your first question, so our power electronics business in 2018 is going to be in the region, yeah, $250 million. Could you maybe just repeat your second part of your question? I'm sure I didn't fully capture it.","John Murphy","Well, on slide 9, you highlight that you have 120 new launches in 2018, so I would imagine that's all obviously, that represents all of your new business or the bulk of your new business, I guess, there are some incremental that would come from existing products, but of those 120, could you sort of delineate or bucket what is gas, what is diesel and what is EV? ","Liam Butterworth ","Yes. Clearly, we don't break down by product line launches, but I would say around 80% of those launches are in the internal combustion engine space across GDI, valve train and our commercial vehicle business. And then the remainder is in the electrification, power electronics space. ","John Murphy","Okay. That's very helpful. Then just on slide 13 and I may be dense on this, when I look at the adjusted to the pro forma, if you can just sort of walk me from that. It looks like there was $81 million lost revenue and there is also $72 million of lost or delta I should say, not lost, but a delta of 72 million in operating profit. So what is really going on there? I'm just trying to understand, so we make sure we get the right basis for 2017, off of which to walk, because that means, 81 million of lost revenue and 72 million of lost op income is an 89% margin on whatever you're taking out of there, which is a big giant margin?","Vivid Sehgal","Sure. So I mean there's nothing lost on this side at all, but the way to think about it is that as part of the separation that we went, a level of revenue that was once recorded in the powertrain business actually moved out of Aptiv. So that represents about $82 million of the revenue that we will no longer record and there is a margin impact on that and the remainder, about sort of $70 million odd of cost, adjusted cost that Delphi Technologies will incur as being a public company.","And in terms of the TSAs that we have with Aptiv and the sort of costs that we're basically bringing up to be a standalone company. So that's really the cost, there's nothing lost in that side. This is just a pro-forma based on revenues that have moved over and our public company and structural inefficiencies.","John Murphy","That's incredibly helpful. And then when you think about sort of the separation costs and the restructuring costs, I mean they are both rationalization costs, if you will. I mean when you think about the separation cost, those just go away and then the restructuring, as you work them down, I know it's tough. And then the restructuring charges would typically have an 18 to 24 month payback or would the separation costs also have some sort of payback as you think about this going forward.","Vivid Sehgal","No. The separation costs are primarily related to the spin. I mean these are related in IT set up. It\u2019s related to a whole bunch of things, but these will dissipate mostly by the end of 2018. We do not expect these costs to reoccur. In terms of the restructuring cost, you've seen the benefit. I mean if you look at sort of the margin benefit, 180 basis points in 2017 and some of the margin expansion plans, restructuring has been used as part of our capital allocation profile of the company and we've seen some great benefit on that. So there will be benefits going forward. Our intention going forward is to begin to ratchet down the level of restructuring we have in the company and in about three years\u2019 time, we will look and we\u2019ll normalize in our restructuring efforts more in the sort of $15 million to $25 million.","Liam Butterworth","Yeah. We spent a lot of time and effort over the last several years rotating the footprint for the one that we have now. So our goal is to significantly ratchet down restructurings to go forward, because what confident that we have a fantastic platform in place to take the business forward.","John Murphy","But just somewhat exposed by the question, if you spend a dollar on restructuring, it would be fair to assume that payback would come in 18 to 24months, is that sort of your rough rule of thumb of how you would think about that or is there some kind of a different thought process?","Vivid Sehgal ","No. I think look, I think when we look at the benefits we're getting mostly on the manufacturing side, I think your thought process is right. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Langan of UBS. Your line is now open.","Colin Langan","When I look at the margin for Q4 of the 12.7%, does that include the impact of stranded cost, is that just seasonally stronger because your guidance for next year which have stranded costs is 12.2 to 12.4?","Vivid Sehgal","Yes. So in the Q4 of 2017, we have one bunk of stranded cost. That's the -- if you look at slide 13 on the deck, you can see the difference really between the reported and the adjustment. Those two columns are the one month worth of stranded costs that are included.","Colin Langan","And then when we think about capital allocation, what are the key priorities? There is several potentially large powertrain assets on the market. Would you consider a large transaction or should we consider most of that is cash that you are generating towards buyback. How should we think about that?","Liam Butterworth","So let me -- first let me give you some perspective really on the M&A, the M&A element of our capital allocation strategy and Vivid can maybe talk a little bit more detail about the other pieces. But really as I said before, we've been putting in place a strong foundation for this business over the past four years from a footprint, technology and customer perspective. And with that now, with the business where we don't have a hole in the portfolio from a technology standpoint, from a product standpoint or a capacity headwind coming out as well, we believe that we need to do something to fill a gap.","Our focus is really laser-focused around organic growth, delivering our commitments for 2018 through to \u201920. As I said, we have 120 programs in the pipeline, $7 billion of lifetime revenue. So it's really around delivering organic growth and that's what's in the plan and we will deliver to our commitment. ","Now looking forward, clearly, we have a strong balance sheet in place and the cash profile gives us options to be able to look at inorganic opportunities and clearly M&A is an option for us and clearly that would need to bring the right technology and market position, but above all just generating long-term shareholder value. So we will look at what opportunities are out there and consider them appropriately.","Vivid Sehgal","Yeah. And actually just to add, look our capital allocation framework is really underpinned as Liam said by driving strong balance sheet and driving through sort of incremental cash flows. And that's reflected in our 2018 outlook. Our main focus right now is on organic growth investments in R&D and CapEx and as Liam said, there is an element of selective approach on M&A and we are going to have a balanced approach to shareholder returns. We\u2019ve already announced our dividend in Q1 and we will evaluate share repurchases, but we're early days as a company now and our focus right now is on delivering our commitments for 2018 and driving improved cash flow performance for the year.","Colin Langan","And any color on the types of assets, you said selective approach to M&A. I mean, are you looking for more complementary products to build out your footprint, core products you have today. I mean, how should we think about the types of things we are looking for?","Liam Butterworth","No. Well, I think we are not going to get into specifics, but as I clearly said, we don't have a hole in our portfolio where there is desperately something we need to acquire to have a position of relevance. I think the way that we've been looking at M&A, and I think the PolyCharge investment that we recently made is just looking at how can we invest deeper technological opportunities to help us be more innovative and stronger in the market. ","And if you look at our -- the position that we have with our power electronics, we're incredibly happy with where we are from a differentiated technology standpoint and the PolyCharge investments just makes us even stronger in that space. So I think those are the kind of opportunities that we've been looking at and consider. But clearly, we have a balance sheet in place that we can look at other options as well, should it create long-term value.","Colin Langan","And just one last question. In your assumption, what is the off-highway and commercial truck market outlook? And what percent of your sales today are in those markets?","Liam Butterworth","So we don't break down that part of our business in terms of revenues, but in terms of the overall outlook, it's relatively -- I think it's around 1% growth for next year, sorry for 2018. But clearly our business is growing kind of double digits in 2018 in that space and that's really primarily because of the content shift that's been taking place that I referred to earlier on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Emmanuel Rosner","So first question on the margin side. So the 2018 guidance for operating margin was maybe slightly below where we\u2019d have expected it. And when they look at it, I see two factors. The first one is 2017 pro forma of 11.9, I think you had spoken about 12% or so and then obviously expansion of 30 to 50 versus the 40 to 50 framework that you had spoken about. So just wanted to see if you can give a little bit more color on both.","First of all, do you have a fourth quarter pro forma margin and was there any -- what were the factors that sort of like may have made it weaker than previously expected? And then as you move into 2018, it looks like the low end of guidance may be a bit less margin expansion then your framework, maybe what would drive that?","Vivid Sehgal","In terms of the margin, I think the important way that we look at margin for 2017 is that we increased operating margin by in excess of 180 basis points during the year and we talked about the ongoing restructuring activities, we talked a lot about our operational efficiencies that we put in place. Sort of Q4 margins really came about, we were very comfortable with that, but looking at them, there is probably two impacts that impacted us. The first one, we had a very strong growth in GDI and power electronics in Q4 and as I have spoken in the past, these have a lower margin on an operating basis than the rest of our portfolio. So that is part of the reason why the margin was lower.","We did have some elements as well in terms of the mix on the aftermarket business, which actually came in a little bit lower. We had higher sales on the OES side of the business. So I think really that's where it is, it\u2019s 10 basis points of difference from where we talked about and we're not overly concerned about that at all. I think going forward into 2018, if you look at our midpoint of our guidance, we are exactly in line with the range that we gave previously and we just feel that right now, given where our business is, given with our investment profile of the company, we\u2019re very comfortable in light of where the business is. And more importantly, we are firmly on track to deliver the 140 basis points of margin expansion that we talked about to get us back to pre-spin levels by 2020.","Emmanuel Rosner","And just as a quick follow-up on this one and then I've another question. But, so you were talking about this sort of negative mix impact on margins from GDI and power electronics. I assume this is a temporary issue due to low volume of these products. What kind of revenue ballpark do you need to be in for those businesses to generate sort of average type of margin?","Vivid Sehgal","Yeah. I mean in terms of the margins, we talked about power electronics for example being a $250 million business in 2018, but really from our perspective, both businesses need to be around about the $750 million to $800 million worth of sales before we get back to company average margins. We expect GDI to get to that number around about 2020 and we expect power electronics to get there around about 2022 to 2023.","Emmanuel Rosner","Then the, sort of the housekeeping question. Would you be able to update us on the lifetime bookings product category? This was a very interesting disclosure as part of your split, marketing, but specifically gas direct injection, power electronics, commercial and valve train. Just curious how those lifetime bookings have grown since the last disclosure that we had in September?","Liam Butterworth","Yeah. It\u2019s Liam. It's something that we don't intend and we don't give down really a breakdown of bookings by product family. Clearly at the Investor Day, we gave a high level overview of how those three main groups were going to be growing over the course of the plan. But, as I said earlier, the 7.1 billion that we booked in \u201917, around 2 billion obviously in the power electronics space. The remainder really being split again across our core product lines and portfolio. So that's kind of the level of detail that we disclose.","Emmanuel Rosner","And then very finally, on the question on light duty vehicle diesel revenue, I think you were talking about revenue down 11% in the fourth quarter year-over-year. Obviously, your assumption going forward basically includes maybe a 20% above the annual decline sort of a meaningful acceleration from what you saw in the fourth quarter. Can you please go over again sort of like the timing of when that happens and what would be the drivers of it?","Vivid Sehgal","Sure. So if you think about 2017 for the full year, we saw around 100 basis points worth of headwind in terms of light duty diesel on our top line revenue. We're expecting 200 basis points of headwind in 2018 and that's really sort of broken down into two parts. About one-third of that headwind is related to the actual market dynamics in the diesel penetration, primarily in Europe and about two-thirds of that headwind is related to the rolling off of more mature diesel programs in passenger car that we will see rolling off over time. What we have said it that we believe that there will be a 200 to 300 basis point headwind on our top line revenue for the next three years. And at that time, we'll start normalizing back in the 2020 timeframe.","Liam Butterworth","Yeah, that's really a reflection of again looking back at our bookings profile, if you look back to 2014 where we were around 4.7 billion, that's a reflection of, there was a number of light duty diesel programs in the market and our commercial discipline strategy was that we didn't book those programs and we're seeing those rolling off now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets.","Joseph Spak ","Maybe just to follow-up on that quickly, so the one-third of the 200 basis points headwind on diesel or the 67 bps I guess, what does that correlate to in terms of a diesel mix shift that you expect in the European market?","Vivid Sehgal","Sure. So we\u2019re estimating that the diesel power market penetration in Europe will go from around about 44% to around 42%, 41% in 2018. And for every 100 basis points of decline, we equate that to being around about $15 million of revenue at about company average margins. And then the rest of it is really about the roll-off of the legacy programs.","Joseph Spak","Just On the electrified sort of bidding process or I guess actually more on the 48 volt programs you've already won. As automakers, your customers may have increasingly difficult times hitting 95 grams of CO2 per kilometer as sort of diesel demand is probably lower than what they thought a couple of years ago. Are you seeing them move timelines or raise values on the 48 volt programs at all yet?","Liam Butterworth","So I think, maybe if I just thought more holistically around the electrification and what we\u2019re seeing in the space, there's clearly a tremendous amount of activity going on across nearly all of the OEMs that we deal with and every OEM is kind of taking different approaches in terms of how to electrify. But clearly, I would say over the last 12 months, the number of pursuits that we're working on, our engineers are deeply engaged with, is accelerating and I would say in terms of the complexity of these programs, how to package the electronics, how they're integrating different features and functions and software into the electronics is increasing significantly. ","Now in terms of 48 volt, maybe Mary, do you want to add a couple of comments on the technology side?","Mary Gustanski","Yeah, absolutely. I think the biggest point that I would make is, as Liam points out, lots of activity around electrification and what the OEMs are looking to do, but they're really debating, do they take the 48 volt mild hybrid stuff, whether they jump right to higher voltage. ","So ETDs, plug-ins, BEDs and the reason they're considering that is if they look at the regulatory outlook, particularly in Europe and China, there is another step function they believe coming right behind the current regulatory around the books, and so their debate is just right to the higher voltage where they could get the bigger bang for the buck. And for us, from a Delphi Technologies standpoint, as you know, that's really where we differentiate ourselves and our biggest opportunity and increased CPD for electrifications. So we\u2019re going to remain focused, making sure that we have all different levels of solutions available to help our OEMs, but with a high focus on that high voltage electronics.","Joseph Spak","And then last one from me and sorry if I missed this. But can you point to a couple of the drivers that really strong Asia Pacific growth in the fourth quarter and what should we expect in that region for \u201818?","Liam Butterworth","Yeah. It's GDI and commercial vehicle. GDI, I\u2019d say two things happened in GDI. One is just continuing transition from PFI to GDI technology, which clearly gives us the content increase, but also just more penetration with our technology and then the second one on the commercial vehicle space, which is in the medium and heavy duty platforms, again emissions and regulations driven and content per vehicle increase and that's ramping up from our facility in China and that will continue through 2018.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Liam Butterworth, President and CEO of Delphi Technologies for any closing remarks.","Liam Butterworth","So thank you all for joining us on today's call. We look forward to providing an update on progress at our next earnings call. I also look forward to meeting some of you at our upcoming roadshows in the next week or so. So enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."]}}
