My name is Shannon and I'll be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the presentation over to David Rosenbaum, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Rosenbaum, you may proceed.","David Rosenbaum","Good morning and thank you for joining Brighthouse Financial's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. Our earnings release, slide presentation and financial supplement were released last night and can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at brighthousefinancial.com. We encourage you to review all of these materials, and we will refer to the slide presentation in our prepared remarks.","Today you will hear from Eric Steigerwalt, our President and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Ed Spehar, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer period. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are Myles Lambert, Chief Distribution and Marketing Officer; Conor Murphy, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rosenthal, Chief Investment Officer.","Our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Brighthouse Financial's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in Brighthouse Financial's filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Information discussed on today\u2019s call speaks only as of today, February 11, 2020. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed on today's call.","During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles, also known as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures on a historical basis to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related definitions may be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website in our earnings release, slide presentation or financial supplement. And finally, references to statutory results including certain statutory base measures used by management are preliminary due to the timing of the filing of the statutory statements.","And now I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Steigerwalt.","Eric Steigerwalt","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2019 was a very strong year for Brighthouse Financial as we made significant progress executing our strategy. I\u2019m very pleased with our outstanding results in 2019 as we exceeded our targets for sales, normalized statutory earnings and adjusted earnings per share less notable items.","Importantly, we significantly strengthened our capitalization, ending the year with approximately $9.7 billion of statutory total adjusted capital, up $2.3 billion compared with 2018 and with an estimated combined RBC ratio of approximately 550% for 2019.","We also achieved several strategic milestones. First, we successfully managed through early adoption of variable annuity capital reform contributing to the significant growth of statutory total adjusted capital in 2019. Second, we introduced Brighthouse SmartCare, our first new life insurance product launch as a public company. And finally, we completed the full transition to our multi-manager investment platform.","In addition to the strategic milestones, we continue to prudently manage our transition service agreements with MetLife to ensure a stage and systematic implementation of our operating platform. And we generated additional statutory capital through a focused effort on balance sheet optimization, including receiving approval to take a $600 million dividend from Brighthouse Reinsurance Company of Delaware.","Moving forward, we believe that we are well-positioned to continue the execution of our strategy, which we expect will drive shareholder value in 2020 and beyond. As we have previously discussed, one of our goals is to be a consistent returner of capital over time and we continue to make progress toward achieving this goal. We repurchased approximately $128 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter and we've continued repurchases in the first quarter of 2020 with approximately $23 million of our stock repurchased in January.","Since the announcement of our first stock repurchase authorization in August of 2018, we have repurchased a total of approximately $570 million of our common stock through January 2020, well ahead of our initial expectations. Last night we announced that the company authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $500 million of our common stock.","We currently anticipate fully utilizing this new authorization within the next 12 months. Assuming full utilization of this new authorization, we will have repurchased $1.1 billion of our common stock more than 70% of the way towards our target of returning $1.5 billion to our shareholders by the end of 2021.","Now let me turn to fourth quarter results. Our key highlights for the quarter are summarized on Slide 3 of our earnings presentation. First, we had another strong sales quarter. We had approximately $1.9 billion of annuity sales, up 10% compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. We continue to be very pleased with our sales as well as the quality of new business we are adding each quarter.","Additionally, we're continuing to see excitement from our long-standing distribution partners and remain focused on making our distribution network as broad as possible, as we help consumers in the United States achieve financial security. To that end, just last week, we launched our Secure Advantage 6-Year Fixed Indexed Annuity.","The launch of Secure Advantage Six-Year represents the collaboration of Brighthouse Financial and Market Synergy Group, which gives us access to an exclusive network of independent marketing organizations and reflects our continued commitment to provide a tailored set of products that respond directly to client needs in a changing retirement landscape.","Moving to life insurance. We continue to focus on our hybrid life insurance product Brighthouse SmartCare. We generated approximately $19 million of deposits in 2019. I am very excited about the strong sales momentum as we enter the new year and we expect significant growth from SmartCare in 2020. We have made good progress adding major distributors for our SmartCare product with access to a network of over 56,000 advisors. And we intend to roll out this product to additional distributors over time.","Second, total annuity net outflows were approximately $1.2 billion in the quarter, down from the fourth quarter of 2018 and up sequentially due to normal seasonal variation. As we\u2019ve said previously, we expect to see a continued shift in our business mix profile over time as we had more cash flow generating and less capital intensive new business coupled with the runoff of less profitable business.","Third, corporate expenses, which do not include establishment costs were $283 million in the fourth quarter, consistent with our expectations. We are still projecting $150 million of corporate expense reduction on a run rate basis by year-end 2020 and an additional $25 million of corporate expense reduction in 2021.","Fourth, we continue to make necessary investments in our technology infrastructure and in our businesses. We refer to these investments as establishment costs. In the fourth quarter, establishment costs were approximately $32 million before tax and $118 million before tax for full year 2019. We believe establishment costs will be around $150 million to $160 million in 2020 and $25 million to $35 million in 2021, both on a pre-tax basis.","As I\u2019ve said before, we are being prudent in how we are managing our way through our expected final couple of years of TSAs. These TSA exits and associated system transitions put us one step closer to our future state operating platform.","Next, let me touch on our earnings results. Normalized statutory earnings were very strong in the quarter at approximately $600 million, bringing the 2019 total to roughly $1.9 billion. Adjusted earnings less notable items increased sequentially to $265 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 or $2.46 per share.","Full-year adjusted earnings, less notable items were approximately $1.1 billion or $9.58 per share, a 15% growth in adjusted EPS less notable items compared with 2018. And finally, we continue to prudently manage our statutory capitalization.","As I mentioned, at year-end 2019, our estimated combined risk-based capital or RBC ratio was approximately 550% with total adjusted capital of approximately $9.7 billion and approximately $1.7 billion of assets above CTE98. Going forward, we plan to discuss our capitalization using RBC rather than CTE, because under variable annuity capital reform the regulatory framework now aligns with how we manage the business.","Our hedging program continues to perform well across a wide range of economic conditions and in line with our expectations. In the fourth quarter, we made revisions to our variable annuity hedging strategy that fundamentally lowered the risk profile of the company and preserves distributable earnings across different capital market scenarios. Ed will discuss these revisions in a moment.","Before closing and as we announced last night, we plan to hold the business update teleconference and webcast for analysts and investors on March 5, 2020 at 8 AM. We will provide additional details closer to the call.","To wrap up, we delivered outstanding results during 2019 as we continue to execute on our strategy. Our sales remain strong, our variable annuity hedging program continued to perform well and we repurchased more of our common stock. Additionally, we have taken steps to optimize our statutory balance sheet, resulting in significant capital generation as we reduced risk in our variable annuity hedging program.","Going forward, we remain confident in our strategy, which we continue to believe will enable us to generate long-term value for our shareholders, our distribution partners and the clients they serve.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed to discuss our financial results in more detail. Ed?","Edward Spehar","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2019. Our statutory metrics have continue to improve as evidenced by our strong capital position, our normalized statutory earnings and the performance of our variable annuity hedging program. And as a result of early adoption of variable annuity capital reform, we now have a statutory framework that aligns with how we manage the business.","Given that we manage the business on a statutory and cash basis, I will start off by walking through our statutory results, and then I will discuss revisions to our variable annuity or VA hedging strategy, which have positive implications for cash and capital. I will finish up my prepared remarks with comments on adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter.","To start off, statutory combined total adjusted capital was approximately $9.7 billion, up $1.3 billion sequentially. The increase this quarter was driven by two factors, strong statutory earnings and a $600 million dividend from Brighthouse Reinsurance Company of Delaware or BRCD. This is the first dividend from BRCD since the separation from our former parent company.","Normalized statutory earnings were approximately $600 million in the fourth quarter as business fundamentals were driven by strong equity market performance and favorable underwriting. Year-to-date, normalized statutory earnings were approximately $1.9 billion, primarily driven by strong equity markets and favorable hedge performance.","Turning to our VA risk management program. Our hedges continued to perform well and in line with our expectations. Assets above CTE98 were approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, a $200 million increase compared to the third quarter. Over the past 2 plus years, our VA hedging program has performed in line with our expectations and we have captured approximately $1 billion of market upside.","We have benefited from a strong stock market, at the same time that Brighthouse has become a much different company relative to when the initial hedging strategy was implemented. We have successfully established our brand, sales are significantly higher and growing and our statutory capital level is substantially above where it was in 2017. Given these developments, we believe it is prudent to adopt a lower risk strategy going forward.","We have revised our VA hedging strategy to reduce risk, preserve distributable earnings across market scenarios and protect the capital generated from the market upside experience to date. With this revised strategy, we plan to operate with a first loss position or deductible of no more than $500 million and are therefore comfortable operating with a smaller cushion relative to CTE98 in normal markets.","As a reminder, our initial VA hedging strategy assumed we would have a $2 billion deductible in 2020 and throughout 2019 this deductible was in the $1 billion plus range. Also, keep in mind that the first loss or deductible concept is related to the hedge target and normalized statutory earnings. The impact to statutory reserves and thus total adjusted capital could be greater than the maximum loss. But if it was, there would be a substantial offset in required capital.","I would also like to reiterate that with the adoption of VA capital reform, our regulatory framework now aligns with how we manage the business. Given this alignment and the fact that we have a large non-VA business going forward, we will discuss our capitalization using projected and actual combined RBC ratios rather than CTE's.","We estimate our 2019 combined RBC ratio at approximately 550%. This is well above our RBC ratio target of 400% to 450%. Additionally, our 2020 total subsidiary ordinary dividend capacity is roughly $2.1 billion. As a result of the substantial reduction in our deductible and strong capitalization, we currently plan to pay more than $1 billion of dividends from Brighthouse Life Insurance Company or BLIC in 2020.","As Eric mentioned, we plan to have a business update call for analysts and investors on March 5 where we will provide an update on VA distributable earnings, which will incorporate the revision to our hedging strategy as well as the related sensitivities.","Before I move on to adjusted earnings, I would also like to mention, as of the end of the fourth quarter, our average financial leverage ratio was approximately 25% and our holding company liquid assets were approximately $800 million, which is flat sequentially and roughly 4x our annual fixed charges.","Moving to adjusted earnings. Last night we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings excluding the impact from notable items of $265 million, which compares with adjusted earnings on the same basis of $260 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $199 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.","There were two notable items in the quarter, which on a net basis increased adjusted earnings by $17 million. The notable items on an after-tax basis were a $42 million benefit from further refinements to certain actuarial assumptions and establishment costs of $25 million in Corporate & Other.","Sequentially, adjusted earnings less notable items were driven by the positive equity market performance in the fourth quarter along with better underwriting margins, partially offset by lower net investment income and an increase in corporate expenses. With respect to the market performance impact, separate account returns were positive 6.1% driven by the favorable equity performance in the quarter. As a result, DAC amortization and reserves decreased sequentially for a combined impact to adjusted earnings of $34 million or $0.32 per share.","The sensitivity of DAC amortization and reserves to changes in separate account returns was slightly below the guidance we have given that every one percentage point change in separate account return equates to $0.07 to a $0.11 per share.","Next, net investment income decreased sequentially. Alternative investment income was lower as the return was 2% in the fourth quarter compared with 3.6% in the prior quarter. Asset growth driven by our continued strong sales momentum was a partial offset. Moving on to our life insurance businesses, sequential results were favorably impacted by improved underwriting margins. Overall, underwriting was favorable relative to what we consider to be a normal quarter.","Lastly, corporate expenses were $283 million, up approximately $35 million before tax compared to the third quarter and above the normal level, which brought full-year 2019 corporate expenses slightly above the 2018 level. As Eric mentioned, we still expect a reduction of $150 million of corporate expenses on a run rate basis by year-end 2020, and an additional $25 million of corporate expense reduction in 2021.","Turning to adjusted earnings at the segment level, starting with annuities, adjusted earnings excluding notable items were $223 million in the quarter. Expenses were higher and fees were lower sequentially, which had an unfavorable impact on earnings. This was partially offset by the favorable market impact. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items in the Life segment were $75 million in the quarter. Sequentially, results were impacted by lower claims, partially offset by lower net investment income.","The fourth quarter reflected the strong results for the Life Insurance segment. Results for full year 2019 were modestly better than 2018 and in line with our expectations. The runoff segment reported adjusted earnings excluding notable items of $6 million in the quarter, which were comparable to the prior quarter.","Corporate & Other had an adjusted loss excluding notable items of $39 million. Sequentially, results were driven by higher taxes. Overall, I'm very pleased with the results this quarter. We increased our already strong capital position and we continue to prudently manage our statutory balance sheet as we shift our hedging strategy to reduce risk, preserve distributable earnings across market scenarios and protect the capital generated from strong equity market returns since separation. Finally, adjusted earnings per share less notable items were solid in the fourth quarter and grew 15% in full year 2019 compared with 2018.","With that, we'd like to turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Andrew Kligerman","Hey, good morning. So I'd like to focus on the hedging. In the second and third quarters of 2019, Brighthouse have reported substantial benefits from, I think, kind of increasing the hedging for interest rates. I think you generated $600 million or $700 million of incremental benefits. And so the question is, has that strategy changed given that we\u2019re looking into 2020 and we've already seen the 10-year down maybe 30 bps. So what might be the effect on 2020 capital as a result of hedging this year? But has that strategy changed from what we saw in 2Q and 3Q?","Edward Spehar","Hi, Andrew. It's Ed. So I think I'll start off by the comment on normalized statutory earnings of $1.9 billion was a significant -- significantly benefited from with strong market and a favorable hedge performance as I said in my prepared remarks. So our old strategy really allowed us to capture the benefit of significant up markets. So the significant statutory earnings we had last year really reflected that market capture strategy. So as we look forward, we're talking about a strategy that will have a more consistent distributable earnings profile and will not be looking to capture upside to the same extent. But we will obviously have a very significant benefit in terms of limiting downside. So the idea of preserving the significant statutory earnings we had last year is really a key driver. When you think about interest rates, we will continue to protect ourselves against low rates. So you -- as you pointed out, and I don't know that the numbers is large as what you stated, but we did see a significant benefit last year from our rate hedges. We continue to have significant rate protection and that will be an element of the revised strategy as well.","Andrew Kligerman","Yes, I really like that shift in strategy. And just kind of -- just kind of rounding it out, so you\u2019ve talked about putting capital at risk of $500 million definitely more prudent versus the potential for $2 billion. And I'm wondering how to think about the cost because I think just as recently as last quarter, the amounted risk was about 1.2 or 1.3. So could -- Ed, could you give us a little -- what\u2019s the delta in the hedging costs that we might see going forward into earnings?","Edward Spehar","Okay. Andrew, it's Ed again. So as you pointed out, the key element of this revision is we're moving from a high deductible strategy to a low deductible strategy. So the benefit here is we obviously have a meaningful reduction in our losses in stress scenarios. In addition, this does allow us to preserve distributable earnings across more market scenarios, which we think is a key element as well. In terms of the hedging program, we are moving to more -- or we have moved to more symmetrical hedges, which means more swaps and less options. So when you think about hedge costs, right, I would just say the way we think about is you've got sort of the fixed cost element of it, let's say, the premiums you're paying on options and the related time decay. And you also have the mark to market from gains or losses in the equity market. So as we have moved to the symmetrical strategy and away from options to swaps, we have a reduction in the time decay element of our hedge costs. But it does mean that our hedge gains and losses are going to be more sensitive to market movements. So in the context of total hedge costs defined as I\u2019ve just stated, I think the way to look at this would be in down markets we obviously have a significant benefit because of the much smaller first loss position. In flat markets, we have significantly reduced hedge costs with the revised strategy. In what I would call normal markets, the hedge costs are pretty consistent. And finally insignificant up markets we would have more hedge costs associated with the revised strategy. But keep in mind that we continue to benefit when the equity market goes up, driven by the future fees associated with our VA account balances. But in down markets, we have substantially reduced the maximum loss we would expect to see.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it. Very helpful, Ed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. First question is the more than $1 billion dividend that you expect to take out of BLIC in 2020. What are your plans with that? Clearly, that\u2019s going to give you a lot more at the holding company than the $500 million buyback. Are you planning on reducing leverage or what are your thoughts on that?","Edward Spehar","Hi, Tom. It's Ed. So let me be a little bit more specific about the dividend plan. So we plan to take $1.25 billion from BLIC in 2020. And when you think about that number, approximately $1 billion of that dividend relates to the revised hedge strategy. And the other $250 million you could think about is more than normal dividend we would've anticipated taking even before we revise the strategy. So as you pointed out, we ended the year with $800 million of cash and liquid assets. The holding company, if you think about that dividend from BLIC and you compare it to the new share buyback authorization, I think you can see that the plan is we would continue to see an increase in cash and invested assets of the holding company. We think it's prudent at this point to build some flexibility at the holding company and I think that just overall prudence around cash at the holding company, invested assets to the holding company, prudently managing the risk-based capital ratio down to our 400% to 450% target over time. I think this is going to be the type of what you think you should see or expect to see from us consistent with what we've been saying all along. In terms of the buyback, because I'm anticipating as you go through this math you see that the capital position, the cash position is very strong. We think that returning a double-digit percentage of our current equity market capitalization to shareholders in the form of a buyback is a pretty compelling value proposition.","Tom Gallagher","So, Ed, the -- so the plan would be to run with a lot - with that excess amount, you probably be what up to maybe almost a $1.5 billion at the holding company. But the plan would be to just run with a lot more access at the holding company for the time being?","Edward Spehar","Correct.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And then my follow-up is, Ed, I heard your comment about the distributable earnings under a range of scenarios. Can you provide a little more context about how we should think about quantifying that a bit in terms of whether it's in proportion or a percentage terms of GAAP earnings or dollars amounts in terms of baseline expectations for ongoing cash flows and dividendable earnings that you would expect to be able to take out of BLIC and the other subs every year? Because I think the biggest question that has surrounded the Brighthouse stock has been the lack of a cash flow story that that people can kind of wrap their head around on a consistent basis. So any way you can kind of frame that would be helpful.","Edward Spehar","Okay. So I guess the first thing I would say is this -- the plan to take the dividend from BLIC this year is the first dividend that we are taking out of BLIC since separation. And $1.25 billion is pretty good number. Of that, the $250 million is more indicative of what we would consider to be a more normal dividend from that operating company. And you've heard us talk about the $60 million to $70 million of normalized run rate we think we would see from NELICO. You also heard us discuss on the call, last quarter about the approximately $200 million of flows that we get to the holding company associated with other flows than dividends. So that gives you a sense of kind of what comes in a normal year. We are going to have to wait until our business update on March 5 to get into the specifics on the distributable earnings under scenarios. As you can appreciate, we're still sort of finalizing all of that analysis based on year-end. So we will have to hold off on that. But the one thing that I would sort of direct you to that maybe help you out here is, the comment I made about hedge costs, under the base scenario, we wouldn't expect a material difference in our hedge costs with the revised strategy versus the old strategy. And I think I'm not going out on a limb here to say that in a bear scenario, this is clearly a lot better considering the significant reduction in the deductible from $2 billion to -- up to $500 million.","Tom Gallagher","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Krueger","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. On your comments on dividends from BLIC, I guess you did mentioned the $600 million that weigh into BLIC from Brighthouse Re. If that something you also plan the dividend up to the holding company over time?","Edward Spehar","Hi, Ryan. It's Ed. Yes, thank you for bringing that up, because I meant to mention that. The dividend we are taking from BLIC in 2020 has nothing to do with the dividend we received from BRCD. So that obviously benefits our risk-based capital ratio. 550% is above our 400% to 450% target. And as you alluded to, I think we would say the strategy is to manage toward that target over time. And the BRCD dividend clearly gives us more flexibility on a statutory basis.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, thanks. And then can you -- you\u2019ve made a lot of changes to the variable annuity hedge strategy. I guess in the context of all of this, can you just give us an update on your thought process potential risk transfer solution as well going forward.","Eric Steigerwalt","Hey, Ryan. It's Eric. I\u2019ve said since the beginning I don't think we've had a conference call where I haven\u2019t gotten this question. And my answer really hasn't changed. If there's a transaction that can add long-term shareholder value and is executable, then we would absolutely look at it. I would say and I hope it actually goes without saying a little bit here that anything we would consider doing in the future, we would consider doing from a position of strength.","Ryan Krueger","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi. I just had a question on your -- just overall competitive environment in the annuity market and your outlook for Shield. And specifically in the buffer annuity market, because you\u2019ve seen a lot of other companies come out with similar products to the Shield and you are growing fairly faster, but at a slower pace than you were before. So just any comments on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of competitive trends in the market?","Eric Steigerwalt","Hey, Jimmy. Sure, Jimmy. It's Eric. I will start and then I will let Myles jump in here. Just the one thing I want to say is, we've had a number of years here of excellent sales growth. And while we're working really hard at Brighthouse, I got to thank our distribution partners and the advisors, who work for them. They have done a terrific job for us. We continue to get inbound calls from new distributors and we\u2019ve got a new product that just came out. So let me turn it over to Myles and walk you through it a little bit.","Myles Lambert","Good morning, Jimmy. Thank you for the question. Yes, so we remain very pleased with our Shield results. Actually the fourth quarter last year marked our best quarter yet with Shield results a big driver of that. As Eric just mentioned a moment ago is that last year for three firms with their first full-year in selling our Shield product and those three firms did about $800 million of incremental sales. So as we continue to add wholesalers and bring on new distributors as well as enter new channels with our Shield product, we remain very optimistic. We are going to be able to continue this type of grow.","Jimmy Bhullar","And you think the competitive environment is still fairly rational in terms of other companies coming out with similar products and pricing in terms of their offering?","Myles Lambert","Yes, I mean, we like the competitive environment. We think it's a good thing for our advisors and consumers. It further validates the product category and we like our competitive position -- positioning within the product category. So we think it's a good thing.","Jimmy Bhullar","And just relatedly how fast are you expecting your Life sales to ramp up? And are you assuming -- are you expecting to roll out any additional products this year or is it mostly just through further distribution expansion of your -- the previously introduced product?","Myles Lambert","Yes, we are very pleased with the progress we are making with SmartCare. We are selling the product now through over a dozen firms. In the fourth quarter, we had a $11 million of deposits for the second half of the year. We paid for about 250 cases. SmartCare will be our focus this year, but we are also looking to introduce new products in the foreseeable future.","Conor Murphy","Hi, Jimmy. It's Connor. And I'm just going to add as well. Maybe I can orange you back to what we talked about a couple of -- about a little over a year ago at the last outlook call, and which we will talk about again at the next outlook call as we are looking towards substantial sales -- increase in sales in Life over the coming years and momentums continued nicely here in the beginning of the first quarter.","Jimmy Bhullar","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Scott","Hi. Good morning. First question I had was just on the statutory earnings. You expect to generate, I guess thinking through 2019 is probably not great in terms of been representative of go-forward just because of the implementation of the VA reform and so forth. So I was wondering if you could help us out with that. I mean is that expected to be roughly in line with the 250 you mentioned? I mean that sounds kind of like relative to what you\u2019ve been calling normalized stat earnings. So I was just interested if there is some other use of the expected stat earnings?","Edward Spehar","Hey, Alex. It's Ed. So if you look at the comments I made on dividends, so $250 million expected from BLIC and say the $60 million to $70 million from NELICO. If you take that combination and then -- remember, we're growing. So as you just heard, there's a very good sales story here. Sometimes I don't know that it gets as much attention as it should, but there is some strain associated with that. And so if you're thinking about normal stat earnings, I\u2019m not going to give you a number, but take those two dividends and assume it's something about that.","Alex Scott","Got it. And could you frame how we should think about the amount of capital that's sort in use for business growth?","Edward Spehar","Yes, I think that is an excellent question to ask at our business update on March 5.","Alex Scott","Okay. And then, maybe one more housekeeping item quickly. The corporate expenses, overall, I know you mentioned how much it come down. I think that was like the run rate for the 12 months after the IPO, it's relative. Can you just frame how corporate expenses should come in 2020 and how that will trend down off the $283 million you had this quarter?","Edward Spehar","Yes. So, first of all, this quarter was unusual. I think if you look at the 246 of adjusted earnings, the way to think about it is we've -- we had probably about $0.25 a share of unusual market favorability relative to our base assumption for separate account returns. And that was essentially offset fully by the operating expenses being above a normal run rate level. So the fourth quarter expense level is clearly not indicative of what we would expect in the first quarter of 2020 or throughout. In terms of the target, the second half run rate of corporate expenses annual basis is $900 million, which is what we had given as our target for 2020 and that would be the $150 million reduction that you referenced versus the initial starting point of expenses.","Alex Scott","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. Maybe following up on that last question. And you mentioned some noise, specifically in annuities around the favorable market impacts in the fourth quarter as well as the higher expenses. So can you just help us think about the run rate earnings power of the annuity business in 2020?","Edward Spehar","So, what I think I'd rather do is maybe give you a little bit of help on the run rate earnings power of the company, overall. So if you looked at this quarter, as I said, the big items would be the market and the expenses and they essentially offset. There are obviously puts and takes every quarter. We talked a little bit about underwriting was little favorable, but overall the number is probably a pretty decent number to think about, or maybe a little higher. And if you look out to 2020, I would be thinking about growth driven by the reduction in corporate expenses that we just -- that I just referenced and the full-year impact of the buyback we had in '19 and whatever buyback you're going to see in 2020.","Erik Bass","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then one for the hedging program. Just can you talk about the impact of shifting away from an options based strategy on the required cash outlays for the program? And does that have free cash flow implications since, I guess you have an upfront cost of purchasing options?","Edward Spehar","No, I think the -- the cash implication is there could be more liquidity needed associated with a symmetrical hedging strategy, but that is not an issue for us at all. In terms of the distributable earnings, I would say, I go back to the comment I made that in a base type scenario, there is not a material difference in hedge costs between our new strategy and the old strategy, overall. And again hedge costs defined as premium that you're paying and the associated time decay with options, and the mark to market gains and losses that you would expect to see with the symmetrical instruments like swaps.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, if you guys said approximately went during the year, that dividend from BLIC should take place. And I guess, as we think about that and then share repurchase, should we just think about kind of consistent repurchases, I guess throughout the fourth quarter. And just another capital related question I will throw it in there. It sounds with all the talk about repurchase that we should assume that that\u2019s the main capital return metric versus perhaps say dividend at some point to shareholders.","Edward Spehar","Hi, Elyse. It's Ed. So I think on the last question, yes, I think you should assume that buyback is the way we're returning capital to shareholders. I think in terms of the BLIC dividend, you probably should expect to see it spread out throughout 2020. And then remind me again your middle question.","Elyse Greenspan","I was just asking about share repurchase. Should we think about that kind of being even throughout \u2026","Edward Spehar","Run rate, right. So I think the run rate will be -- I think you see a little bit less in the first quarter, because of the -- really the blackout dates associated with the update call, so it would be a slightly lower run rate -- slightly lower than the run rate we've seen. I think it's like $80 million, something like that $80 million, maybe is what we would expect. And then if you look at the subsequent three quarters, you probably should be looking at consistent with what you've seen in the prior quarters.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then in terms of the $600 million dividend from BRCD. I just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly. That\u2019s not necessarily all coming up with the Holdco in 2020. That\u2019s part of the RBC drive down over time. Is that correct?","Edward Spehar","Correct. Except I would modify just a little bit to say that there is no plan to take any of it to the Holdco in 2020.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just to kind of circle back on the revision in the hedge program. So in the past, you used kind of out of the money options as part of the strategy, and now it's changing to swap. Is there still an element of that kind of out of the money kind of component in your hedge program? And if so, has that changed compared to where it was in the past?","Edward Spehar","Hi, Humphrey. It's Ed. There's still an out of the money component associated with interest rates.","Humphrey Lee","But not equity markets?","Edward Spehar","Yes, not to any substantial than -- some, but \u2026","Humphrey Lee","Okay.","Edward Spehar","\u2026 much, much, much different.","Humphrey Lee","All right. Got it. And then in terms of -- I understand you talked about your intent to keep a little bit more at the Holdco at least in the near-term, while the RBC you\u2019re kind of saying you gradually you would draw it down to 400% to 450% from 550%. But is there any plan to hold on to at least additional RBC buffer for the time being so that essentially probably won't see a draw down below that level until a later period.","Edward Spehar","Sorry, Humphrey, what was the last part of your question about the RBC cushion?","Humphrey Lee","Yes. So, right now you have 550% versus a target of 400% to 450%. Is there any plan to hold onto additional buffer for the time being similar to you guys holding to more cash and liquidity at the Holdco?","Edward Spehar","Well, you may keep in mind that as we take $1.250 billion out of BLIC, the 550% RBC comes down by a lot, right. The denominator of the combined RBC ratio is about $1.8 billion. So, obviously, that movement of RBC to the holding company is what you're seeing.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ian Ryave with Think America. Your line is open.","Ian Ryave","Thanks. Good morning. One of your competitors expects a decline in annuity earnings as they have some policies that are rolling off, they\u2019re past kind of surrender charge periods. Since many of them were sold, I think in 2010 to 2012, legacy Met sold a lot of these policies in about 2011. When would these policies roll off? And could this dynamic happen to you as well?","Conor Murphy","This is Conor. Let me take that. I would say for us you're seeing a pretty consistent level of outflows over the last 10 quarters. That was remarkably consistent in 2019, and we expect it to be consistent and maybe taking down a little bit in 2020. But you're right, different -- we\u2019ve different tranches, if you will. So yes, we have now some sort of 2011, 2012 Met policies that will be rolling out. But we\u2019ve seen that phenomena over the last few years. We have a little bit. Shield's now is at the 6-year level where we started selling it, but we can actually sell that much of it in 2014. So there is nothing really significant there as well. So we talk about this. We constantly see a pretty consistent level of outflows. Obviously, we're seeing a significant growth in the inflows, getting us to an improving that position all the time. That trajectory should largely continue into 2020. And again, just a reminder that much of what flows out for us is positive from our perspective, and not much of it is from this sort of older more capital intensive like of business from 10 plus years ago.","Ian Ryave","Got it. Thank you. And just on the increased sensitivity of the hedge gains and losses. Is this just a function of switching to more of swaps than using out of the money options?","Edward Spehar","Yes.","Ian Ryave","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Steigerwalt for closing remarks.","Eric Steigerwalt","Thank you, operator. Well, I hope you got a sense here. Obviously, we had a great quarter and a great year. 2019 was a great year for Brighthouse. You can see that our discipline is paid off. And now I sort of think about it as we're adding an extra level of flexibility. And if you watch this in the last 2.5 years, our goal is to turn that flexibility into shareholder value as we move forward.","I just couldn't be more pleased with our progress. We've been prudent and thoughtful in our approach to managing our business, and it's obviously paid off and we are going to continue to do that. The revisions we made to the hedging strategy in the fourth quarter fundamentally lowered our risk profile going forward. And as Ed said, at least three or four times on this call, preserves distributable earnings across various capital market scenarios and we will talk about that more on our update call in March 5.","We are running this company for all of our stakeholders and believe we are well positioned to continue the execution of our strategy, and we expect that to drive shareholder value in 2020 and beyond. So we look forward to speaking with all of you on March 5 and thanks for being on the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Mr. Rosenbaum, you may proceed.","David Rosenbaum","Thank you, Sonia. Good morning and thank you for joining Brighthouse Financial\u2019s First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Our earnings release, presentation and financial supplement were released last night and can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at brighthousefinancial.com. We encourage you to review all of these materials. And we will refer to the slide presentation in our prepared remarks.","Today, you will hear from Eric Steigerwalt, our President and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Conor Murphy, our Chief Operating Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer period. Also, here with us today to participate in the discussion are; John Rosenthal, Chief Investment Officer; and Myles Lambert, Chief Distribution and Marketing Officer.","Our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Brighthouse Financial\u2019s actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in Brighthouse Financial\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Information discussed on today\u2019s call speaks only as of today, May 7, 2019. The company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed on today\u2019s call.","During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures that are not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, also known as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures on a historical basis to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related definitions may be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website, in our earnings release, slide presentation or financial supplement. And finally, references to statuary results are preliminary due to the timing of the filing of the statutory statement.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Steigerwalt.","Eric Steigerwalt","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Brighthouse delivered solid results during the first quarter of 2019. Equity markets were strong and favorably impacted both adjusted earnings and capital generation during the quarter. Investment income from alternative investments was lower as expected, given fourth quarter market performance.","Claims were higher in life insurance due to lower reinsurance recoveries, but within normal quarterly variation. Sales remain very strong and we continued to reposition the investment portfolio and manage expenses. Moving forward, we remain focused on executing our strategy, which we continue to believe will generate long-term shareholder value.","As we have previously disclosed, one of our goals is to be a consistent returner of capital over time. And we are making progress toward achieving this goal. We repurchased approximately $52 million of our stock in the first quarter. And we\u2019ve continued repurchases in the second quarter of 2019 with approximately $14 million of our stock repurchased in April.","Through April, we have purchased $171 million of our stock, under the $200 million authorization announced in August of 2018.","Last night, we announced that the company authorized the repurchase of an additional $400 million of our common stock. This brings our cumulative authorizations to $600 million, 40% of the way towards our target of returning $1.5 billion to our shareholders through 2021.","We currently anticipate fully utilizing this authorization within the next 12 months, but we will continue to be measured in our approach to repurchasing stock.","We believe we have multiple levers to achieve the remainder of our capital return target. First, we are prudently managing the capital backing our variable annuity block. During the quarter, we completed a successful preferred stock offering. The net proceeds were contributed to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company or BLIC. And this higher level of assets puts us in an even better position to reduce hedging costs over time.","Although BLIC has ordinary dividend capacity in 2019, we are currently planning for regular dividends to the holding company from BLIC to begin in 2020, post the implementation of variable annuity capital reform in our statutory financials. As we have said before, this will be an important milestone for the company.","Second, as we have said previously, our reinsurance subsidiary, Brighthouse Reinsurance Company of Delaware is robustly capitalized. We believe there is redundancy in the reserves and thus the possibility that over time excess capital could be released. We are beginning conversations on this topic with our regulator in the coming months.","Third, the New England Life Insurance Company, or NELICO, has been and we anticipate will continue to be a stable source of capital for the holding company. As you may recall, during the fourth quarter, NELICO paid a dividend to the holding company of $400 million. Additionally, NELICO\u2019s 2019 ordinary dividend capacity is over $100 million.","We intend to dividend this amount to the holding company later this year. Our ability to take out capital from NELICO was an important factor in determining our new stock repurchase authorization. We expect NELICO will continue to generate $60 million to $70 million of dividend capacity per year over the next several years.","And finally, we currently have excess capital at the holding company. As a reminder, our goal is to have liquid assets at the holding company of at least 2 times our annual fixed charges. And as of the first quarter 2019, we are well in excess of our target.","Before I provide a few perspectives on our first quarter results, I wanted to update you on our CFO search. There is a lot of interest in this role. We have begun the interview process and I would like to have this role filled in advance of our second quarter earnings call.","Turning to first quarter results, our key highlights for the quarter are summarized on Slide 3 of our earnings presentation. First, I\u2019m very pleased with our outstanding sales results in the first quarter. We had approximately $1.7 billion of annuity sales, our highest quarterly sales result, since becoming an independent public company in 2017.","Annuity sales were up 36% in the first quarter, compared to the same period in 2018. In February, we launched our new hybrid life insurance product, Brighthouse SmartCare. This launch marked our first life insurance product introduction since becoming an independent public company and is part of our strategy to reestablish a competitive presence in the U.S. life insurance market.","This product builds on our foundation of experience and knowledge in the life insurance space as we enter the expanding hybrid market. The early feedback from our distribution partners has been extremely positive. We intend to roll out this product to additional distributors throughout the year.","Second, we\u2019re continuing to make necessary investments in our technology infrastructure and in our businesses. We refer to these investments as establishment costs. In the first quarter, establishment costs were approximately $34 million pre-tax. We still expect establishment costs of approximately $175 million to $200 million pre-tax cumulatively during 2019 and 2020.","Third, let me touch on our earnings results. Adjusted earnings, less notable items improved sequentially driven by the strong equity market performance in the quarter. This positive impact was partially offset by the lower investment income from our alternative investment portfolio, which was in line with our expectations, given the unfavorable equity markets in the fourth quarter of 2018, as well as higher claims due to lower reinsurance recoveries in life insurance in the quarter.","And finally, we continue to prudently manage our variable annuity capitalization. As we have talked about previously, we are managing our VA business to CTE98 or higher. As of the end of the first quarter, our VA assets were $1.1 billion in excess of CTE98 consistent with our strategy. Our hedging strategy continues to perform in line with our expectations.","To wrap up, we had solid results this quarter and we are very excited about the new stock repurchase authorization and the value that it creates for shareholders. Moving forward, we continue to remain focused on executing our strategy and continue to believe that it will enable us to achieve our longer-term financial targets.","With that, let me turn the call over to Conor to discuss our first quarter financial results in more detail. Conor?","Conor Murphy","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will start with our first quarter results presented on Slide 4, and then provide some perspectives on the key drivers for the quarter, and our hedging and balance sheet position.","Adjusted earnings, excluding the impact from notable items were $259 million in the quarter compared with adjusted earnings on the same basis of $199 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $288 million in the first quarter of 2018.","Adjusted earnings in the Annuities segment were strong, while results in Life and Run-off were lower sequentially. There was one notable item in the quarter of $27 million after-tax related to establishment costs.","Now, I would like to provide more perspective on the underlying drivers of the results. Overall, the strong equity market performance in the first quarter favorably impacted adjusted earnings results. This was partially offset by lower net investment income mainly driven by alternative investment results due to the equity market decline in the fourth quarter of 2018 and higher claims due to lower reinsurance recoveries in life insurance.","The market rebound in the first quarter resulted in a favorable impact to adjusted earnings of approximately $70 million after-tax or approximately $0.60 per share. The positive market impact is reflected through lower DAC amortization and SOP reserves.","While the first quarter equity market had a positive impact on fees, overall first quarter fees were lower sequentially driven by lower beginning separate account balances due to the challenging market conditions in the fourth quarter coupled with fewer processing days in the first quarter. Variable annuity separate account balances ended the quarter at $98 billion, up from $92 billion at year-end 2018.","Next, our net investment income was lower sequentially driven by alternative investment income, which broke even in the quarter. This was in line with our expectations and down $40 million sequentially post-tax. As is typical, alternative investment income is reported on a one quarter lag. Given the favorable first quarter market performance, we expect alternative investment income to be higher in the second quarter of 2019.","The negative impact on net investment income from alternatives was partially offset by gains from asset growth and the ongoing repositioning of the investment portfolio. Through the first quarter of 2019, we\u2019ve repositioned approximately $6.9 billion of treasuries into a diversified mix of high-quality spread assets putting us approximately 90% of the way towards completion of the repositioning program.","Another key driver of adjusted earnings results in the first quarter was our life insurance claims experience. Sequentially, we saw higher claims driven by lower reinsurance recoveries. However, claims experience was within normal quarterly fluctuations.","Lastly, our corporate expenses in the first quarter were $225 million, down approximately $8 million pre-tax sequentially consistent with our expectations. We anticipate full-year 2019 corporate expenses to be in line with or slightly below the 2018 full year level, as we continue the transition to the Brighthouse\u2019s operating platform. We are still projecting $150 million of corporate expense reduction on a run rate basis by year-end 2020 and an additional $25 million in 2021.","Now, turning to adjusted earnings at the segment level, which excludes the previously mentioned notable item. Adjusted earnings in the Annuities segment were $295 million in the quarter. Sequentially, results were favorably impacted by the first quarter rise in equity markets, resulting in lower DAC amortization and SOP reserves, along with an increase in net investment income. This was partially offset by a decrease in fee income from lower beginning separate account balances and fewer processing days as I discussed earlier.","Total annuity flows improved sequentially, despite the fact that the first quarter capture remnants of the outflow of 10-year-old block of fixed annuity business that reached the end of its surrender period in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Adjusted earnings in the Life segment were $25 million in the quarter. Sequentially, results were unfavorably impacted by higher claims due to lower reinsurance recoveries along with lower returns from alternative investment. This was partially offset by lower DAC amortization related to the positive market performance in the first quarter.","The adjusted loss in the Run-off segment was $36 million in the quarter. Sequentially, results here were unfavorably impacted by lower alternative investment returns. Corporate & Other had an adjusted loss of $25 million. Sequentially, expenses were lower, partially offset by a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2018 that did not recur.","Before closing, I would like to provide a few updates on our variable annuity hedging and balance sheet position as of March 31, 2019. Firstly, our variable annuity block had $1.1 billion of assets in excess of CTE98, and our hedging strategy is performing in line with expectations. Balance sheet results both on a GAAP and CTE98 basis were in line with sensitivities shared in our 2018 Form 10-K.","Secondly, we completed a successful $425 million preferred stock issuance during the quarter. The net proceeds were contributed to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company and we believe this puts us in a better position to lower our hedging costs over time.","Additionally, total adjusted capital was $6.3 billion, down approximately $1.1 billion from the prior quarter. This reflects the existing variable annuity reserve requirement, driven by the standard scenario, which are less sensitive to market movements than our CTE hedging target.","We intend to adopt NAIC VA Reform for statutory reporting by year-end 2019, which will remove the existing standard scenario requirement. Also, our average leverage ratio was approximately 24% at the end of the first quarter. And as a reminder, we have no outstanding debt maturities until 2024.","And finally, our holding company liquid assets were approximately $1.1 billion at the end of the first quarter. With that, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Krueger of KBW. Your line is now open.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you give any perspective on how much redundant reserves you think you may have and be able to release in the captive entity? And also, any thoughts on the process around how long it may take to negotiate with regulators?","Eric Steigerwalt","Ryan \u2013 hey, Ryan, sorry. Thank you for your question. We\u2019ve talked about our captive and our expectation of having redundant reserves there over the last few months. Those conversations with our regulator are really planned for this summer. So any expectations we have would be following those conversations and following the adoption, the full adoption of VA reform later in the year.","We haven\u2019t quantified it for you. But it is something that we\u2019re going to be focusing on through the rest of 2019.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks. And then, it seems like Life claims are at least a little bit elevated in the quarter. Can you size that at all, just relative to your baseline expectation?","Eric Steigerwalt","Yeah, you\u2019re right, they were a little. I would say claims were a little elevated in \u2013 across Life, both in the Life segment and in the Run-off segment. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get into this as well. Both of those segments were also impacted by lower alternative returns. So within the Life segment, it\u2019s probably a little more to do with the mortality, not so much the level of claims, we had a little bit of an elevated claims frequency, but not severity.","It\u2019s more to do with the level of reinsurance was lower than our average run rate. And that can happen. That\u2019s just circumstantial based on the actual individuals affected in the quarter. But I would underline again that it was within the sort of expected range of mortality. It was a little less impactful in Run-off. But in Run-off had really more of an impact from the lower alternative returns.","So perhaps, not terribly different from prior quarter, but still a little bit elevated from where we would have expected the average level to be.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is now open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Good morning. I want to start with the VA capital generation. As we think about the buffer building over time, it seems like a fair amount of the increase has come from capital infusions or repurposing of assets. So just want to get a sense of when does the VA business start to build capital organically, what are your expectations there?","Eric Steigerwalt","Well, so thank you, Suneet. There are a few elements to that. So, yes, we contributed some capital over time into the VA business. And I was really, as we expected, beginning back in 2017 and we\u2019re separate. But I would argue that that\u2019s in line and probably actually a little less than what we might have expected over time.","In terms of the generation of the business, I would say, we\u2019re very much in line with our expectations even in this quarter. We generated approximately $300 million of normalized [start] [ph] earnings this quarter. So I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get into our new authorization. But that authorization is really more aligned to what we took out of NELICO last year.","But going forward, we\u2019re feeling very comfortable with the distributable earnings generation power and capabilities within the VA block. We don\u2019t anticipate contributing more assets there. Clearly, we\u2019ve been able to help fund the hedging program. We\u2019re very comfortable with how the program is working. We\u2019re very comfortable with where we\u2019ve ended up the quarter in terms of our excess amount above CTE98.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And then, if we think about capital return, the $1.5 billion, I believe in the past, you said that that was sort of predicated on your base case macro assumptions, which I think at least in terms of interest rates assume a higher level of rates than what the forward curve is currently implying. So if rates stay sort of where they are, so they don\u2019t pick up to the 4.25 over 10 years, you still feel confident in $1.5 billion of capital deployment guidance that you\u2019ve given?","Eric Steigerwalt","Hi, Suneet, it\u2019s Eric. Yeah, we do. I\u2019ve said in my prepared remarks that we have numerous levers, whether it\u2019s dividends from NELICO, whether it\u2019s BRCD, whether it\u2019s even just holding company cash levels now that move us into the back end of 2019, we\u2019re forced as many companies. You got to pick some scenario, right. Something has to be sort of the base case. And so you know what those numbers are. But in direct answer to your question, yeah, I feel at this point, that we\u2019re comfortable with and are not changing our target for capital return.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners. Your line is now open.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Looking at your VA surrenders and withdrawals, it looked better this quarter relative to where you\u2019ve been running in the past and that definitely helped your net flows number. But I was just wondering how should we think about net flows in general, but also specifically on the surrenders and withdrawals going forward. Do you feel like the $2.4 billion this quarter versus kind of $2.8 billion in the past is sustainable?","Conor Murphy","Thanks, Humphrey. Yeah. Let me say a few things and we begun to talk about this increasingly over the call. We feel great about the progress that we\u2019ve been making in terms of the new business for Brighthouse. You are seeing definitely not just a reduction in withdrawals, but an increase in the sales as well. And I\u2019ll let Myles add some color in a moment.","But certainly in terms of the annuity business, you can see across both the variable and fixed, we\u2019ve significant improvement, about a 34% improvement year-over-year and 38% sequentially in terms of the net number. So you\u2019re seeing withdrawals come down.","To be honest, this has been happening for a while. It was just a little clouded last quarter. If you remember, on the fixed side, we had a block of 10-year-old fixed business that was coming out of surrender, which is why the net flows progress, if you will, on the fixed account value wasn\u2019t evident so much last quarter. And even this quarter, I would say, that number is a little elevated.","So on the fixed, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re really much more to a neutral number. But on the variable, yeah, we\u2019re seeing a decline below the $1 billion a month mark for the annuity business going forward, and obviously an increase in the business that we\u2019re writing, which I\u2019m going to ask Myles to give a little color on as well.","Myles Lambert","Yeah. Thank you, Conor. So our expectations are that the majority of our flows throughout this year will come from our suite of indexed products, our FIA solution and Shield, but obviously, that can change with market conditions. But I think, as you think about our business moving forward, as it relates to new sales, we\u2019re pretty confident that most of our flows will come from FIA and Shield.","Conor Murphy","And, Humphrey, let me add one thing, because the last couple of quarters I\u2019ve been adding some color as well. In terms of the outflows, we consider whether those outflows are what you might term as good outflows for us versus outflows we\u2019d be quite happy had we been able to retain them. A lot of that is really based on the level of capital required, or the capital intensiveness of the business.","And we would characterize this quarter\u2019s outflows \u2013 the gross outflows at being about 35% to 40% of them as being good outflows from the perspective of Brighthouse and Brighthouse\u2019s balance sheet.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. And then, moving \u2013 shifting gear to kind of your VA deductible position. I think, you ended the year at $1.2 billion range. With the capital contribution this quarter, where do you stand in terms of that VA deductible level? And or is it compared to \u2013 and then, are you still targeting $2 billion as you kind of where you want to be?","Conor Murphy","Yeah. So broadly speaking, yes. We are \u2013 we have been operating at that level, but we highlighted at year-end at about $1.2 billion, and obviously, we \u2013 the underlying objective is to ensure that we protect the CTE95 level. So yes, we have more flexibility now that we\u2019ve been able to put the proceeds of the preferred in. But if you think about it maybe in a couple of ways, there are a lot of ways that we can accomplish this. We\u2019re currently sitting at $1.1 billion above CTE98. So even if we were to require or use the $1.2 billion, we would still be almost exactly at 98. So we have great flexibility there, which we\u2019re very happy with.","Another way to think about this, maybe, that might just be a simpler perspective is, we were \u2013really 98 would be what we might consider a AA level of capital, and 95 might be a A level of capital. So we\u2019re comfortably above that AA mark. Using the current amount, would still likely keep us at AA. But we\u2019re going to protect the A in the extreme scenario.","So really with how effectively the hedging program continues to work and our ability to participate in the upside and the start earnings that we \u2013 the normalized earnings that we generate in the quarter, everything is working really very much in line with how we expected it to.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alex Scott","Hi, good morning. First question I had was just on the FASB impact. I know, you\u2019re probably not ready to talk about a book value \u2013 transition book value impact and specifics like that. But I guess, just thinking more high level, could you comment on how you might plan to deal with your approach, increased volatility in the future? Is this sort of just remain at the current course in terms of strategy? Or would you potentially look at reinsurance any changes to the hedging strategy like this is change anything in the way that you plan to manage the business?","Conor Murphy","Thank you. So it\u2019s a fair question, but it\u2019s really just too early to tell. If I could maybe underscore a couple of things, remember, where we manage the company and the \u2013 our ability and capability to continue to distribute to shareholders on a statutory basis, and even within that on a CTE basis with a view to the full adoption of VA reform. So there\u2019s really \u2013 there\u2019s nothing with respect to the long duration contract accounting that we see that\u2019s going to really \u2013 that\u2019s going to impact our ability to return capital to shareholders or to reach our $1.5 billion capital return target towards 2021.","I know this question has come up a little bit on some of the other calls. And of course, we\u2019re doing our work and we\u2019re working through the operational elements of this, but it\u2019s going to be a while before we are going to be able to speak to the implications. But I would say, as maybe some of our peers have talked about as well, we\u2019re going to be the same Brighthouse after the long duration contract accounting is adopted as we are today.","Alex Scott","Okay. My follow-up question I had was on the Annuities segment. It looked like net investment income yield ticked up pretty significantly, and I know you\u2019re going through some reallocation, but I think it went up over 470 basis points. Do you think is that a good run rate or is there anything in that number that I should be thinking about as we head into the second quarter?","Conor Murphy","Well, so a couple of things, but yes, in terms of the relative performance of the segments, if you will, Annuities had a stronger quarter perhaps compared with expectations, and Life and Run-off a little less. And yes, annuity is a beneficiary of the bulk of the favorable market that we talked about, or that we highlighted in our deck. But it has higher recurring NII. So you\u2019re seeing the benefits of a couple of things here. You\u2019re seeing the growth of Shield is showing up here. So you\u2019re also seeing the benefits of the portfolio repositioning.","We talked about that, well, we highlighted it a lot last year at Investor Day. And much of that portfolio repositioning has been completed north of 90% at this stage. So you are \u2013 but Annuities too. It had favorable market. It had lower asset-based fees, that was a bit of an offset as well.","But, yes, it did outperform a little bit, because it is seeing more of the benefit of that portfolio repositioning that we\u2019ve been talking about.","Alex Scott","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, this is [Casta] [ph] on for Tom. I guess, just a follow-up on Alex\u2019s question. For the NII in Annuities, is it fair to assume that that\u2019s going to come down going forward or stay around this level? Can you just talk about what are your expectations are there?","And then, as a follow-up to that, how much of a \u2013 could you just frame the \u2013 like different impacts or the different benefits between Shield and the re-positioning in terms of a sequential increase?","Conor Murphy","Okay. Well, let me help you out a little bit here after, [Casta] [ph]. Thank you for your question. How I would think about annuities a little in terms of \u2013 I think you\u2019re really getting at maybe a bit more of a run rate question. And so you should \u2013 I would acknowledge that, yes, we had \u2013 the favorable market was a good guide, if you will.","But as you think about it going forward, remember that you would have the ongoing fee implications will improve Annuities next quarter. And we mentioned in the call about just the number of days impact on the fees, so those are going to be offsets to what you would kind of consider the annuity run rate going forward.","Then the other element that\u2019s probably worth mentioning is, we highlighted the relative underperformance in the old portfolio, but as I mentioned earlier, really the underperformance compared with what we might consider to be our expectations is really concentrated wholly in Life and Run-off. We do have a small allocation of [odds] [ph] to the annuity portfolio.","And they actually did perform in line with expectations, so that should continue or something. Obviously, that can be a little volatile but that should, broadly speaking, continue in the forthcoming quarters as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we do have a follow-up question from Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alex Scott","Hey, thanks for taking another one from me. I guess, I just wanted to go to NELICO and the dividend capacity that you mentioned. Could you help me understand why the dividend capacity is so strong out of that entity?","I guess just looking at year-end statutory balance sheet, the surplus looks like it\u2019s only around $200 million. So, I guess, I\u2019m surprised that at how much you expect to be able to consistently take out of that over the next several years. Do you have any color there, it would be helpful?","Conor Murphy","Okay. Well, so in terms of the capacity at year-end predicates $131 million after, obviously, having taken out $400 million. The way that I would think about NELICO is the expectation \u2013 NELICO, remember, it\u2019s a close block of business. It\u2019s not writing any new business. Therefore, it\u2019s a lot less sensitive to the vagaries of the market.","And our expectation is that on an annual run rate basis that we continue to generate maybe a little average around $75 million or $80 million. That might fluctuate between kind of $60 million and $100 million, but it will likely continue to do that for many years to come.","Alex Scott","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rosenbaum for closing remarks.","David Rosenbaum","Thank you.

Mr. Rosenbaum, you may proceed.","David Rosenbaum","Thank you, James. Good morning, and thank you for joining Brighthouse Financial\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Our earnings release, presentation, and financial supplement were released last night and can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at brighthousefinancial.com. We encourage you to review all of these materials, and we will refer to the slide presentation in our prepared remarks.","Today, you will hear from Eric Steigerwalt, our President and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Anant Bhalla, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer period. Also, here with us today to participate in the discussions are Conor Murphy, Chief Operating Officer; John Rosenthal, Chief Investment Officer; and Myles Lambert, Chief Distribution and Marketing Officer.","Our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Brighthouse Financial\u2019s actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in Brighthouse Financial\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Information discussed on today\u2019s call speaks only as of today, February 12, 2019. The company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed on today\u2019s call.","During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures that are not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, also known as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures on a historical basis to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related definitions may be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website, in our earnings release, slide presentation or financial supplement. And finally, references to statuary results are preliminary due to the timing of the filing of the statutory statement.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Steigerwalt.","Eric Steigerwalt","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2018, our first full year as an independent company, was a strong year for Brighthouse and we made significant progress executing our strategy. As we reflect on the year, we continue to believe that we have a solid strategy in place and that it will generate long-term shareholder value. 2018 provided many examples of our progress which are summarized on slide 3 of our earnings presentation.","First, I'm very pleased with our outstanding sales results in 2018, which we capped off with approximately $1.7 billion of annuity sales in the fourth quarter, our highest quarterly sales since becoming an independent public company in 2017.","Full year 2018 annuity sales of $5.9 billion are significantly ahead of our expectations at the time of separation and are a testament to the strength of our distribution relationships and the success of our branding initiatives. Annuity sales were up 36% in 2018 compared to full year 2017, led by shield and fixed indexed annuities.","I'm especially pleased with the success of Index Horizon\u2019s, a fixed indexed annuity product that is sold through MassMutual which had sales of over $1 billion in 2018.","And this week, we are launching our new hybrid life insurance product, Brighthouse SmartCare. This launch marks our first life insurance product introduction since becoming an independent company and is part of our strategy to reestablish a competitive presence in the life insurance market.","This product builds on our foundation of experience and knowledge in the life insurance space, as we enter the expanding hybrid market. Brighthouse SmartCare is currently approved for sale in 47 jurisdictions and then initially will be available through select distribution partners.","We are continuing to see excitement from our long-standing distribution partners and remain focused on making our distribution network as broad as possible, as we help consumers in the United States achieve financial security.","In 2018, we added shield annuities to the platform of two major distributors and we entered the Independent Marketing Organization or IMO channel. And in January 2019, we announced that Brighthouse will be among the first companies to offer annuities through the Envestnet Insurance Exchange, a program that integrates insurance solutions into the wealth management process on the Envestnet platform.","We believe we are entering 2019 with a lot of sales momentum and remain focused on growing sales moving forward. Overtime we expect to see a shift in our business mix profile as we add more cash flow generating and less capital intensive new business, coupled with a runoff of less profitable business.","To that end during the quarter, our total annuity outflows increased, in this quarter primarily driven by the outflow of a 10-year-old block of fixed annuity business that reached the end of its surrender period. Our variable annuity net flows were consistent with the third quarter of 2018.","The second example of the effectiveness of the execution of our strategy is the exit of Transition Service Agreements or TSAs with MetLife. We began 2018 with 147 TSAs and ended the year with 81 TSAs remaining inline with our targets. We expect additional TSA exits will facilitate further expense reduction.","We are also continuing to make necessary investments in our technology infrastructure and in our businesses. We refer to these investments as establishment costs. In the fourth quarter, establishment costs were approximately $49 million pretax bringing the 2018 total to approximately $239 million pretax and inline with our expectations.","We expect additional establishment costs of approximately $175 million to $200 million pretax cumulatively over the next two years. Annual establishment costs in 2019 are expected to be lower than the 2018 level and decline even further in 2020 helping to drive improvement in net income.","Third, let me touch on our earnings results. Focusing on the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings were unfavorably impacted by the challenging market conditions in the quarter. Full year adjusted earnings per share less notable items were $8.33 modestly below our guidance range, primarily due to the results from the fourth quarter. Adjusted return on equity less notable items was almost 8% in line with our guidance.","Next, we continued to prudently manage our variable annuity capitalization. As we talked about previously, we are managing our VA business to CTE98 or higher. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our VA assets remained in excess of CTE98 consistent with that plan. Our hedging strategy continues to perform in line with our expectations.","And finally, the $200 million stock repurchase authorization that we announced in the third quarter reflects our commitment to returning capital to shareholders and the confidence we have in our strategy going forward. This capital return commenced approximately two years ahead of the time line we communicated at the time of separation.","During 2018, we repurchased approximately $105 million of our stock and we've continued to repurchases in the first quarter of 2019 with approximately $19 million of our stock repurchased in January.","Before I turn the call over to Anant to discuss the fourth quarter results, let me touch on our longer-term financial targets. On our December 2018 Investor Outlook Call, we provided additional insight into key drivers of near-term performance and demonstrated how our financial targets have improved significantly since the separation.","Our outlook reflected meaningful earnings growth, ROE improvement, and robust capital return to shareholders. Despite the challenging market conditions experienced in the fourth quarter, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our longer-term financial and operational targets.","To wrap-up, we made significant progress executing our strategy in 2018. Our annuity sales were very strong and our operational performance was very good highlighted by the exit of 66 TSAs. I'm especially pleased with our hedging program, which performed in line with expectations in 2018 in both favorable and unfavorable markets. As we move into 2019, we remain focused on executing our strategy and continue to believe that it will enable us to achieve our longer-term financial targets.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Anant to discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail.","Anant Bhalla","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I will start with our fourth quarter results beginning on slide 4, and then provide some perspectives on the key underlying themes and our balance sheet position. Adjusted earnings excluding the impact from notable items were $199 million in the quarter compared to adjusted earnings on the same basis of $314 million in the third quarter of 2018 and $197 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. These results were inline with our expectations given the fourth quarter market performance.","I want to point out two notable items in the quarter; these items resulted in a $13 million after-tax decrease in adjusted earnings or $0.11 per diluted share. The notable items included, a $26 million after-tax net favorable impact related to modeling improvements which resulted from an actuarial system conversion and establishment costs of $39 million after-tax.","Now I'd like to provide some perspective on the market impact to adjusted earnings this quarter. Separate account returns were negative 9.2% in the quarter. This was favorable compared to various equity market index price decline of 13% to 20% as about one-third of our separate account assets are invested in funds that are more fixed income oriented.","Nevertheless, separate account performance was below our base case assumptions by approximately 11 percentage points. Overall the market decline in the fourth quarter resulted in an unfavorable impact to adjusted earnings of approximately $95 million after-tax or approximately $0.81 per share as shown on slide 5.","The quarterly market impact is not linear or symmetrical, primarily driven by DAC amortization and SOP reserves and can range from $0.07 to $0.11 per share for each percentage point change in separate account returns. Approximately three-fourth of the impact is from these two items, while the rest is from a change in fees on average separate account balances.","Variable annuity separate account balances which drives fee income, ended the year at $92 billion, down from $104 billion in the third quarter. Given the strong market recovery we experienced in January with separate account returns up approximately 6%, we currently anticipate no change to our annual adjusted EPS target of low-double-digit percentage growth.","We expect the drivers of adjusted EPS growth in 2019 to be investment income and capital return. Next our alternative investment income in the quarter was slightly above our 2017 quarterly average. As is typical, alternative investment income is generally reported on a one quarter lag.","Given the market declines in the fourth quarter, we expect alternative investment income to be lower in the first quarter of 2019, but it's too early to provide an estimate.","Staying with investments through the fourth quarter we have repositioned approximately $5.8 billion of treasuries into higher-yielding assets putting us approximately 80% of the way towards completion of the repositioning program.","Turning to expenses, corporate expenses in the fourth quarter were $233 million, down approximately $9 million pretax sequentially consistent with our expectations. We anticipate 2019 corporate expenses to be in line with or slightly below the 2018 full year level as we continue transition to the Brighthouse operating platform. We are still projecting $150 million of corporate expense reduction on a run rate basis by year end 2020.","Now, turning to adjusted earnings at the segment level, which exclude the previously mentioned notable items. Adjusted earnings in the annuities segment were $163 million in the quarter. Sequentially, results were impacted by the fourth quarter decline in equity markets, resulting in higher DAC amortization and reserves, lower fees, partially offset by lower expenses.","Adjusted earnings in the life segment were $64 million in the quarter. Sequentially, results were favorable, impacted by lower claims driven by lower severity in the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by higher DAC amortization.","Adjusted earnings in the run-off segment were $4 million in the quarter. Sequentially, results were unfavorable impacted by higher reinsurance costs and lower recoveries. We still expect the run rate of adjusted earnings in this segment to be approximately $15 million per quarter with possible variation quarter-to-quarter.","Corporate and other had an adjusted loss of $32 million. Sequentially, other expenses including debt interest expense were higher.","Let me now provide an update on our fourth quarter performance in terms of hedging and statutory results as well as our balance sheet positioning. First, this quarter provides a great example of how our hedging program is well-designed to work in times of market volatility and stress.","Our variable annuity block continues to have assets in excess of CTE98. Balance sheet results both on a GAAP and CTE98 basis were in line with the sensitivity shared on our December outlook call.","Second, statutory total adjusted capital was estimated to be $7.4 billion, up $1.4 billion from the prior quarter, driven by gains attributable to the performance of our variable annuity exposure management program in the fourth quarter.","Our 2018 combined risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be in the 475% area. Given the performance in the quarter, we have achieved a level of statutory results that enable our insurance subsidiaries to have meaningful ordinary dividend capacity even before implementing NAIC Variable Annuity Capital Reform. This is an important milestone for Brighthouse and we will be prudent on both the timing and amount of any dividends we take out of our insurance subsidiaries over time.","Third, full year 2018 adjusted statutory earnings were approximately $320 million, slightly above our expectations. Next, holding company liquid assets were approximately $750 million at year-end.","On February 1, we refinanced our $600 million term loan facility which was scheduled to mature in December 2019 with a new $1 billion term loan facility that matures in February of 2024. This results in liquid assets of the holding company that are currently in excess of $1.1 billion. Additionally, we have no debt maturities until 2024.","To close, given the strength of our balance sheet, our effective hedging strategy and our excess liquid assets at the holding company, we believe Brighthouse is well positioned to successfully navigate through market volatility and across market cycles. We remain focused on executing our strategy and committed to prudently returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis.","With that, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Josh Shanker","Yes. Thank you and congratulations on tough quarter. I was curious, the market was down 9% in December. The 10-year treasury yield fell a little more than 30 bps and obviously you came close, I assume, to breaching the CTE98 level, maybe you can put some numbers behind that?","Is that the kind of stress scenario that you're designed, I mean, to be able to succeed at? Clearly, look, we were all stressful at work during those days, but a 10% market correction is not an apocalypse. We're more concerned about 20% or even more than that. Should we be comfortable with the performance of the buffer over that period of time?","Eric Steigerwalt","Good morning, Josh and thank you for the question. You're right. In the fourth quarter, CTE98 did move around. Assets above CTE98 did move around as designed. So let me provide a little color on that. CTE98 requirements increased by close to $4 billion in the quarter with the market move, but they were offset by hedging gains and VA and shield statutory cash flows resulting in assets above CTE98 absorbing and that's the key word, absorbing, the market impact of just under $600 million.","This demonstrates the effectiveness of our out-of-the-money hedging program as assets above CTE98 is the level we were at the end of the quarter, even before putting in $200 million of capital into the company to continue to grow our out-of-the-money hedging program. So we ended at approximately $300 million over CTE98.","The last point I would make on that is, capital is a shock absorber, and we have flexibility in the way we designed this to go below 98 and build back up to 98, because remember the flow is at 95. So there is a huge amount of margin of safety for us to operate over time.","Josh Shanker","And just for identification, if the market had fallen another 5% to 10% in December, but there was also the increase in volatility associated with that fall not that we can say exact numbers, but hypothetically would those two factors be equally offsetting and it wouldn't have a dramatic difference in the ultimate CTE98 level at year end?","Anant Bhalla","The short answer is yes. Maybe, I'll add to that little short answer which is, wall going up is good for us. The bedrock of our program is a large number of long-dated options. So wall going up would help us. And I will dimensionalize because I'm sure this question will come up. The total market impacts were around $2 billion. You can see it in our NDGL line when you look at derivative gain. Of that, wall is a meaningful contributor, but most of it is level of market. And lastly, it doesn't matter if it says 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% throw the shock at it. The program would sustain it as we showed in our sensitivities back in December.","Josh Shanker","Okay. Well, thank you for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Elyse Greenspan","Yes. Just as follow-up question, I guess two parts. You gave the RBC ratio in your prepared remarks. Could you comment about the target for that ratio, I guess over time? And then, can you give us an update where the CTE98 is at quarter-to-date?","Eric Steigerwalt","Hi, Elyse, it's Eric. I'll start and Anant will jump in. As we said last year, as we get here to implementing the VA capital reform in the statutory financials. We will come up with our RBC target. And then of course, you're going to want to understand excess capital and that was all going to happen this year. We are not quite ready to do that yet, but it's on the way. Anant?","Anant Bhalla","And in terms of \u2013 Elyse feel free to reframe the question, if I didn't get your question, the second question which is as markets would come back in January we expect the assets above CTE98 to go up.","Elyse Greenspan","Yeah, I just wasn't sure if you wanted to give us a frame of reference where that could potentially sit today since markets have come back a bit in January?","Anant Bhalla","So January came back 6% on separate account returns as I said in my prepared comments. Fourth quarter was down 9.2%. While we're not going to run a clock on this to give it exactly point to point, you can see if it came down at around $600 million for that kind of decline, it's going to go back up in the same ballpark area for 6% rise.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you. And then one other quick question. The tax rate was about 13% for the full year 2018. I know you guys have said kind of the target is high-teens tax rate. So when you say that you're going to target low-double digit EPS growth does that assume that your tax rate will go from 13% to something in the high-teens over this coming year?","Anant Bhalla","Hi. It's Anant again. Yes. So we expect the tax rates to be in the teens as earnings grow it will go to the mid-teens while earnings are at current levels probably in the low-teens that's area we would be. We just had a benefit this time around, which is more one-time in nature, and hence the tax rate being low where it was this quarter. Effectively for the year it was 13%. ","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. ","Andrew Kligerman","Hey good morning. Maybe you could help me triangulate a little bit better on the CTE98 number. You reported, let me start with adjusted statutory earnings you reported $320 million for the full year. Last quarter on the call you mentioned that you have earned in the third quarter alone $700 million of statutory adjusted earnings and I assume there were some good earnings in the first and second quarters as well.","So it would strike -- let me give another data point. Last quarter when the market was up 7% it helped capital in excess of CTE98 by $400 million. So -- and that was with the management discussions. Now this quarter the market is down 14% and you are saying your capital in excess of CTE98 is $300-plus million. Last quarter you said it was $600-plus million. So that would only be $300 million drop-off. Is it not linear?","I think I heard you allude to that. Help out with trying to triangulate why it was so different last quarter and why doesn't it seem to square with adjusted statutory earnings? ","Anant Bhalla","Good morning, Andrew. Happy to do so, it's Anant. I'm going to walk you through -- you laid out a very good construct for us to have a dialogue on this. So as you just said last quarter, statutory adjusted earnings were around $700 million.","In the first half of the year I had shared earlier in the year in the second quarter earnings call we had made $175 million. So $175 million in the first half of the year another $700 million on statutory adjusted basis in the third quarter with separate account returns being up 3%, while equities were up 7% as we had mentioned.","That would have given us ending the third quarter, statutory adjusted earnings north of around $900 million. In this quarter, the swing in assets above CTE98 was $600 million as I answered to Josh.","So therefore the net statutory adjusted earnings for the full year go from north of $900 million through the third quarter down $600 million to $320 million approximately. The reason we have -- so we would have ended the year just based on results of the hedging program working and adjusted earnings in the year of north of CTE98 with them having come down -- assets above CTE98 having come down $600 million in the fourth quarter.","We ended at $300 million because we redirected $200 million of capital from NELICO into BLIC to support the VA business to continue our journey of going up in our deductible from $1.2 billion to closer to $1.5 billion sometime later in 2019. So as results stand, my answer would get you to CTE98-plus, as we add the additional capital to grow the hedging deductible we would get to 98-plus $300 million. ","Andrew Kligerman","I see. The NELICO would kind of get me closer. I'm missing by 100-or-so, but that was very helpful Anant. And the second question, how much capital at risk do you have right now, and how did the markets affect that in the quarter? You have your deductible rather, the $1.2 billion I think it is --is that right?","Anant Bhalla","That is right. It ranges between $1 billion to $1.2 billion at this point in time. And I intend this to evaluate it from time-to-time and ramp up when it's opportunistic to do so. To answer your first question on the rounding part, it's because that we have 600 plus and that's the reason why we\u2019ll get within $100 million.","Eric Steigerwalt","Yeah, Andrew it's Eric, I'll jump in for a second too. Anant great job and Andrew that's a great question. It's going to be hard for anybody to get closer than $100 million or $200 million. I mean, you\u2019d have to anticipate how wall worked in the down market and then how it works in an up market et cetera, et cetera.","I think the point that we\u2019re able to make now is the hedging program works in a lousy fourth quarter market. If you think about the answer to Andrew's question and Josh's question, hopefully we're starting to build some credibility around this hedging program. While you're never going to be able to get it down to the penny, I mean within $100 million or $200 million, I think can give people some real comfort. I know where this is going. If you think about Elyse's question, yes the market is up and I think all of you probably have a reasonable expectation of what would have happened if you had a January close. So any follow-up Andrew?","Andrew Kligerman","Yeah, just want to get a sense of where the $1.2 billion of deductible is right at year-end?","Anant Bhalla","Yeah, so in the quarter we would have used approximately 600 of that $1.2-ish billion. And it's dynamic it ramps up and down as we look at it. But two data points I shared with you. So we probably have around $400 million, $500 million of additional downside to absorb if markets continue to fall whatever level they fall to, but that's just a shock absorber. It will come back as we build capital through earnings that's one.","The second is, we don't have to really trade our program that actively as some others have to do. Frankly the natural way our deductible would increase if we didn't take any hedges off was with the next large maturities, which is not till June. So, very stable bedrock of hedges to protect the program.","But to answer your question, we've used half the deductible and it's more of a shock absorber since the hedges are long-term in nature. As January would have shown, the shock absorber has given back.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it. Thanks, Anant and Eric. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Hey, just a few follow-ups there. The \u2013 Anant, I think, did you also take a dividend out of NELICO to the holding company during the quarter? Was that the major driver of cash flow to the increased cash at the holding company? And if so based on your comment you just made, you also redirected capital from NELICO to the VA company. So it seems like a considerable amount of money coming out of NELICO. Was that just because there is significant excess capital there? Have you drawn it all down? Anyway this is my first question.","Anant Bhalla","Good morning, Tom. Yeah, so with us having to put NAIC reform behind us from a management point of view it will come through statuary reporting as we work through the year. It really allows us to think about excess capital where it is where can we take it out, where can we deploy it most judiciously for shareholders. We took $400 million out of NELICO, we put $200 million into BLIC because that's where the VA program is for all our entities. And then that helped holding company cash go up from around $600 million to $750 million in the quarter net of share repurchase.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. And are there other -- as we think about enterprise-wide capital, so clearly, the HoldCo cash is higher. I think you also have the SGUL captive, I mean is that a potential source of capital or should we just think about that funding that required reserves and not necessarily a source of capital?","Anant Bhalla","You've really seen us pivot from putting required behind us and talk about excess. So, over time, you're going to see us looking at taking out excess capital where we generate it through earnings or where it might be.","To answer your question where it might be in our views to come out over time, it's not going to come out overnight. Yes, so NELICO, we've taken some out. We still have around $200 million of capacity in there. We'll probably take some out over there over time and be more sustainable.","BRCD our life capital, specifically, answering your question is capitalized in a very robust manner. We believe that it's redundancy in BRCD in reserves and we expect to work with the regulators but that's more of a later part of 2019 or early part of 2020 dialogue as we can implement VA reform and start running the company on an RBC basis.","And BLIC is very well-capitalized and continuing to put capital in as we grow the deductible and take capital out as we generate statutory earnings, but these dynamics are over time.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. And then final question, Eric, as we head to the two-year anniversary of the spin, if all else is equal and the valuation doesn't change meaningfully, would you -- what are your thoughts on potentially doing something more strategic like whether it's annuity buyouts, or a transfer, where is your head at for things like that?","Eric Steigerwalt","Sure Tom. It's no different place than it has been since the beginning. We will always think about how do we create long-term shareholder value. I think we are demonstrating that we are doing shareholder-friendly things and we will continue to do that. I can tell you our Board is extremely focused on shareholder value.","But I get your point. Look we are heading down a journey here -- down a road, we're executing on everything we said we were going to do. And -- but over time our management goal is to add shareholder value, create shareholder value. So, I'm open to anything long-term.","For the time being, we are going to keep sticking to our strategy and hitting or exceeding all of our marks which is what we've done so far in the two years.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is now open.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, thanks. Good morning. On the 475% RBC, is that still under the old existing framework? And I guess if so when would you expect to fully shift to the new framework post the NAIC VA reform?","Anant Bhalla","Morning Ryan. It is under the old RBC framework only to the tune of RBC is based on CTE90. The new framework will be 98. We did move to using the new framework for all our CTE calculations. So when we talk to you about CTE95, 98, 90 even for RBC reporting, we are reflecting the new framework assumptions, all the proposals that we worked through, we are largely reflecting those. So when it's market returns or behavior assumptions or anything like that. For us, we put that behind us.","The only change that will happen is 90 will become 98, so they're two moving parts. For statutory reporting, when this year we get to adopted, reserves will come down which will take up. TAC will help unassigned funds and I'll talk a little bit about that in a minute.","So the numerator will benefit, the denominator will go up, but 475-area is a good place to be and later in the year we'll update you about our long-term views on running the business. You can see us being very robustly capitalized, relative to single A targets, because we have this out-of-the-money hedging program.","Lastly, on unassigned funds, one very important milestone for us with the program working and the results being strong is that unassigned funds is no longer a constraint or a governor on us. We have positive unassigned funds to the tune of $1 billion, 80% of that being in BLIC now. So if we generate -- as we generate over time, adjusted statutory earnings those have the ability to come out as regular ordinary dividends and all the dynamics I said to Tom about capital in the earlier questions still hold. ","Ryan Krueger","Great. Thanks. And then, similarly, I think, in the past you talked about the non-VA businesses, the cash flow generated from them, roughly equaling statutory strength from sales as well as, I think, holding company interest expense. Is that still roughly the case today?","Anant Bhalla","Pretty much so. ","Ryan Krueger","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. Can you talk about the rational for upsizing the term loan outstanding and your plan to use your proceeds? And also, given the increase in your debt outstanding, how are you thinking about the level of the holding company liquidity you want to maintain going forward? ","Anant Bhalla","Hi, Erik. Thanks for the question. Yes. So the term loan upsize was because, largely it provides us a lot of financial flexibility at the holding company. We've refinanced to our existing 2019 December maturity. So we have no debt maturities for the next five years. Sitting where we are in the economic cycle, that sounds like a good position to be in from the balance sheet holistically. So we can focus on executing our strategy and creating value for shareholders.","In terms of what that puts us in leverage and how we think about hold-co cash, leverage is in the low 20s, which is where we wanted to be, as we prepare for GAAP accounting change in the coming years. And holding company, no change in our thinking. We want to hold 2 times annual interest costs, that's in the $300 million to $400 million range, but this excess liquidity at the holding company is a good place to be. And I'll let Eric add, if he wants to add something to that.","Eric Steigerwalt","I would just say, demand was fantastic for this. So we took advantage of it. Most of our planning was, we would just refinance it and term it out in another five years, but when you have that kind of demand, it was very nice to take advantage of it. So nothing mysterious in there and the rest of Anant's answer stands.","Erik Bass","Got it. And is it something that -- I mean, if you felt comfortable with dividend capacity and other things, that it would give you some flexibility to potentially accelerate capital return or other things in the back half of the year? ","Eric Steigerwalt","Look, overall the name of the game here as we've said since the beginning is flexibility. Capital is fungible. You've seen us put some down. We are very excited about the fact that now unassigned funds is not a constraint as you heard. Anant kind of to walk through. And by the way that's only going to get better. Okay? The unassigned funds numbers are just going to get better in 2020. So yeah, overall, it's flexibility. With respect to capital in return, obviously you see we're buying back stock. I don't want to get ahead of my Board and I never will.","But as I said before in my answer to Tom's question, it is our notion, it is our desire to return capital to shareholders. And I'm hoping that, we will continue to do that. One thing that I will add as I've usually add each quarter is look the name of the game is to get to the point where you can return capital.","Then continue to have added flexibility, but finally the ultimate position to be in is to be a consistent returner of capital and that is where we are focused here. And you've heard a number of things today that, I think are helpful for us, not the least of which is the conversation around unassigned funds. So that's what I will add.","Erik Bass","Thank you. And I guess, Anant on the outlook call, you talked about eventually getting \u2013 excuse me, to a point where GAAP net income becomes a proxy for statutory earnings dividend capacity. As we look at 2018 really, you had adjusted statutory earnings, but \u2013 and I think the net income was a loss of $1 billion. Is switching this dynamic all of the function of reducing the hedge costs or is there something else that we should be expecting too?","Anant Bhalla","Yeah. So hedge costs are the biggest driver of it. The way I'd probably dimensionalize it is adjusted statutory earnings has a liability measure CTE95 and hedges that are moving in tandem with each other. Therefore, you got a liability that's in our view a realistic view of the liability, the economic liability and we are protecting that.","GAAP is not there yet, and statutory is going to get there with the VA and NAIC reform. And therefore, once GAAP gets there with accounting changes down the road that's when it will be closer to adjusted statutory. But yes, reducing hedge costs along the way will really converge those two.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","John Barnidge","Thanks. The fee environment in the asset management industry is certainly a buyer's market. Have you thought about how much you maybe able to save on the investment management agreement with Met when that comes up for renegotiation?","John Rosenthal","Hi. It's John. We actually filed an 8-K last Friday suggesting that we have renegotiated the IMA within Met and entered into a new IMA. Met's going to be an important asset manager for us going forward. We are also going to be \u2013 as we've suggested in the past we're moving to a multi-manager model. So we are going to be on-boarding other managers, during the first half of this year. The IMAs with them are not complete, so it's premature to name any names, but they're all world-class managers. And I would say, just in total, we are saving a material amount of money and that's all in our corporate cost savings projections that we have been discussing with you over the last two years.","John Barnidge","Okay. So that sounds like additional savings per se?","John Rosenthal","No.","John Barnidge","Okay. And then you talked a lot about not a ton \u2013 but going more into the IMO space, will you consider doing that inorganically if there was something compelling? ","Myles Lambert","Sure. This is Myles speaking. Yes, we launched in the IMO space last year and we are partnering with a large national IMO and they are distributing our shield product to certain broker dealers. We have begun having conversations with that organization on about a joint product opportunity that will speak about more in the future. ","John Barnidge","What about M&A for that? ","Eric Steigerwalt","John, it's Eric. Look right now, we are using excess capital to buy back stock. So over time certainly something like that could be a consideration. The right situation, at the right time etcetera, etcetera, but right now we are focused on capital return obviously with the stock where it is, that has to be our number one focus. ","John Barnidge","Makes complete sense. Thank you for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions. First, can you just discuss what do you expect your dividends that you're able to take out from the subs to be, net of any sort of contributions you might be planning to make to BLIC?","And then secondly on sales, on the indexed annuity inside, I think your results are benefiting a lot from the Index Horizon\u2019s product with MassMutual. If you could just discuss, whether there is room to ramp that up further or do you feel that you're sort of getting your full level of production through those agents? ","Anant Bhalla","I will take the first one Jimmy, good morning, on the BLIC dividend. Look BLIC having unassigned funds of north of $800 million is really constructive because while we might put capital aimed to continue to grow the deductible to $1.5 billion and then to $2 billion eventually.","Earnings as they come out through adjusted statutory earnings we can take those out as ordinary dividends, whenever. So if you ask me what is our plan? Our plan is right now to grow capital in BLIC through earnings or contributions to get to $2 billion deductible, but once we get there, we\u2019ll take adjusted earnings out. ","Myles Lambert","Yes, hi. It's Myles speaking. So as it relates to our FIA solution at MassMutual, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the results that we\u2019ve experienced. In the quarter we did $368 million of sales that's up 81% quarter-over-quarter and it marks the best quarter that we have had so far.","We feel that the advisers there really like the product, it's simple, it's competitive, it provides them flexibility around protected accumulation and potentially providing income to their clients. So we're quite optimistic that we're going to continue to see sales growth with the product moving forward. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with UBS. Your line is now open. ","John Nadel","Hey good morning. Anant I was hoping, you could actually walk us through the moving parts below the line on a GAAP basis. How much of the hedge results overall, would you characterize as sort of true mark-to-market gains versus the actual cost of the program?","And sort of back to Eric's question, I know you've been targeting a reduction in those ongoing hedge costs and the convergence between net and operating income. So I was just hoping, you could sort of parse that out for us? ","Anant Bhalla","Happy to do so, John. So, I\u2019ll answer your question in two parts. First of all, you asked what\u2019s the cost of the program relative to the total change. If you look at our VA hedges line, it changed by around $1.84 billion, a gain of the -- the market movements were north of $2 billion positive and then there\u2019s a cost of just the time value of options around $200 million a quarter. Hence the net 1.8\u2026","John Nadel","Okay.","Anant Bhalla","\u2026so, that holds up as we've said in the past and really feel good about the fact that the gains played out as we expected.","Walking from really adjusted earnings to net income, which is I think where you're going with the question, adjusted earnings post- tax of around just shy of $200 million, $185 million going to net income of $1.4 billion, you have the gains on the derivates. So you have the overall variable annuity, net derivative gain and loss, driven by the hedges and the fact that the embedded derivative while it moved, the rider liabilities moved, there was a benefit from the shield that's offset a lot of that line.","So net-net we have gains from shields, gains from hedges north of $2.7 billion offsetting an embedded derivative movement of around $1.5 billion.","John Nadel","Got you.","Anant Bhalla","The net of that is 1.2 swing and there\u2019s $200 million more to explain roughly it\u2019s driven by that own credit that other FAS 150\u2019s adoptions assumptions was around net $200 million, $300 million good guide. Let me pause there threw a lot of numbers at you. So, is that in computer, I can go back?","John Nadel","No, no, no that's very helpful. And then if I switch over to statutory, Anant, and we think about the $1.4 billion increase in statutory capital 3Q to 4Q, how would you advise us to think about that? How much of that is market driven, i.e. we've got a nice bounce in the market to start this year and maybe some of that is a giveback. And how much of that would you categorize more as sort of a permanent increase in statutory capital?","Anant Bhalla","Most of that is market driven as you can see with the movement. It's really adjusted statutory to earnings on what we can bank.","John Nadel","Got you. Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then if I can seek one last one then, just thinking about the Life segment earnings, it's been all over the place. I know you would characterize your expected run rate for the Run-off business at about $15 million quarterly give or take. Any change in your thoughts around the Life segment?","Anant Bhalla","Sure. So Life results this quarter were very good. And I would look at the last four quarters and really 2018 is a good gauge of the earnings power of that business, because we come in pretty steady, second quarter, fourth quarter have had some ups and downs, but if you even average those out and look at all of the four quarters of last year that's a good view on the Life business. Did you have a Run-off question as well, or largely Life focused.","John Nadel","No, no. I\u2019m all good then. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alex Scott","Hi, good morning. A lot of the questions have been answered, but I just had a follow-up on RBC. I guess, the BLIC RBC has been higher, significantly higher given by some of the VA elements of the existing framework. So, I guess those \u2013 just interested to hear some of the dynamics that lead to the 475, because it was a little bit lower of a number than I would have guess before implementing the VA capital standard. So just interested to know what extent did the SGUL captive dragged that down or are there any other dynamics I should be thinking about?","Anant Bhalla","Hi, Alex, good morning. Let me start with the last part of your question. The SGUL captive does not drag that down at all. The operating companies are separate from BRCD. So, BRCD's capitalization does not impact those. Over time, we expect to release some capital out of BRCD, but it's not reflected in RBC ratios.","In respect to what drove RBC ratio of around 475 area for a year-end 2018 relative to like north of 600 in the prior year end, I'll make a few points. And as we previously said, RBC on a pre-VA reform basis is less meaningful which is what we were at year end 2017. It did not reflect aspects of the VA capital reform.","In 2018, though, we have implemented all the assumptions that need to go in to CTE calculations in RBC. The only thing we have left to do now is to actually start reporting financial results where you'll go from CTE90 to CTE98. Therefore the RBC today in the 475 area is we feel pretty good. And as the next step of VA capital reform when statutory financials come through, TAC will go up with reserve release and denominator will go down -- will go up with -- going to CTE98, but RBC ratio is in a good area. The good part is the standard scenario headwind is behind us and unassigned funds are in a positive situation.","Eric Steigerwalt","Anant, I might add.","Alex Scott","Okay, got it.","Eric Steigerwalt","Hey Alex, hold on a second, it's Eric. I might ask you -- I think one thing that might be confusing is you're saying pre, right? It's sort of half pre, half post, right? I mean if you think about the RBC ratio. I'm asking him questions for Alex this is interesting.","Anant Bhalla","Thank you, Alex and Eric. That's right. 2017 pre-VA reform, 2018 was sort of semi-post-VA reform. That's the key point Eric's rightly making over here, because we are reflecting post-VA reform in our CTE90 calculation. So we're already there.","Alex Scott","That's really helpful. I think I got what I needed. And maybe if I could just do a quick follow-up. As it relates the deductible that you talked about , I think it sounds like the deductible is still intact, partly because the markets come back, partly because there is some injection.","I mean if we had a scenario where the deductible got hit say half of it was gone and it stayed there. I mean is there anything you'd have to change around your hedging program, like can you continue to implement the same strategy or does it sort of work both ways where if you ever to increase the deductible hedge costs go down, but if the deductible is hit and it's got to be go back up over time whether things you have to do to the hedging program that could increase costs?","Eric Steigerwalt","It's a great question. We got a lot of flexibility around how we manage the hedge program on the deductible. Because as we've shown -- so five quarters still at the end of third quarter, we made $1 billion the way we were running the hedge program with market upside participation.","Now, even if we eat into the deductible, I'll make two points on that. First of all, we have to between CTE95 and CTE98, we can go below CTE98. So, there's a large margin of safety there.","The second point is we can always toggle to being a little more at the money than out of the money. It's not that that toggle isn\u2019t there for us. This margin of safety that we have and the peace of mind that we've been able to work with all our stakeholders to understand gives us a lot of flexibility here to generate capital in good times, to absorb loss in stress times, and then rebuild capital over time.","Alex Scott","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Rosenblum for closing remarks.","David Rosenbaum","Thank you, James, and thanks to everybody for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings conference call and for your interest in Brighthouse Financial and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Sandra, and I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the presentation over to David Rosenbaum, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Rosenbaum, you may proceed.","David Rosenbaum","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining Brighthouse Financial's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Our earnings release and financial supplement were released last night and can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at brighthousefinancial.com. We encourage you to review all of these materials.","Today, you will hear from Eric Steigerwalt, our President and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Anant Bhalla, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer period. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management.","Our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Brighthouse Financial's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties including those described from time to time in Brighthouse Financial's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Information discussed on today's call speaks only as of today, February 13, 2018. The company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed on today's call.","During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, also known as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related definitions may be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website, in our earnings release and in our financial supplement.","Following recent SEC guidance, we changed the nomenclature for operating earnings to adjusted earnings while retaining the definition.","And finally, references to statutory results are preliminary due to the timing of the filing of the statutory statements.","And now I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Steigerwalt.","Eric Steigerwalt","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2017 was a transformative year for Brighthouse Financial. In March, we began offering annuity and life insurance products under the Brighthouse Financial name. Over the course of the year, we rolled out a focused set of advertising campaigns designed to introduce our brand and showcase our flagship Shield annuities. These campaigns have helped generate brand awareness in the market and allowed us to hit the ground running as a new public company. I believe our sales results this quarter reflect that momentum.","In June, we established the long-term capital structure for the company with a very successful inaugural debt offering. Specifically, we issued $3 billion of bonds equally split between 10- and 30-year maturities at attractive coupon rates. Of course, the highlight of 2017, a year with many important milestones, was our separation from MetLife on August 4 and our listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market on August 7. And today, we are reporting earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017, our first full quarter as a stand-alone public company.","Overall, I feel very good about our progress relative to our plans. With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss three topics, first, I'll touch on progress made on the product and distribution front. Next, I will make a few comments on our fourth quarter results. And lastly, I will provide some perspectives on 2 regulatory items impacting our industry.","Let me start with product and distribution. As I stated earlier, I'm very pleased with our annuity sales results in 2017 and the sales momentum we have carried into 2018. Our distribution partners, their advisers and the clients they serve have responded positively to our strategy and positioning as a focused annuity and life insurance company in the U.S. We see continued excitement from distribution partners that have worked with us for years and inbound interest from those that may want to explore a strategic relationship going forward. As a focused manufacturer of annuity and life solutions, we highly value and benefit from our distribution partnerships. We believe our fourth quarter sales results reflect strengthening relationships and solid sales momentum.","Our annuity sales were up 25% sequentially and 26% quarter-over-quarter. Sales of our Shield annuities were $794 million in the quarter, up 22% sequentially and up 74% quarter-over-quarter. In late July, we celebrated the launch of Index Horizons, the first product to be created as part of our 10-year distribution agreement with MassMutual. Index Horizons is a white-label, fixed-index annuity sold by MassMutual advisers. Brighthouse Financial assumes 90% of the economics through reinsurance with assumed sales of this product of approximately $203 million in the quarter, up from $69 million last quarter. We are pleased with the continued success of Index Horizons and excited to leverage our partnership with MassMutual's more than 9,000 advisers.","We plan to continue to offer new products that are simpler, more transparent and provide value to advisers, clients and our shareholders, and we will continue to listen to feedback from our partners and make product updates that respond to the evolving needs of their businesses. Just yesterday, we launched a new version of FlexChoice, our guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider available on our VA platform. This updated version of FlexChoice provides access to more investment options, giving advisers greater control to help build lifetime income for their clients. We believe this update strengthens our VA portfolio and serves as an excellent complement to our suite of Shield annuities.","Now I'd like to take a moment to provide a few comments on our fourth quarter results. First, I'm very pleased that the variable annuity capital strategy performed in line with our expectations, resulting in $2.6 billion of assets above CTE95 at quarter end. This gets us closer to our goal of $3 billion, which is an important milestone and the level at which we expect to begin returning capital to shareholders.","Second, our corporate expenses were $287 million in the quarter, up from the third quarter but in line with our annual run rate expectation in our first year post separation of between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Expenses are a key metric for us. As I have said before, a part of our business strategy is to be a cost-competitive manufacturer over time. Exiting transition service agreements or TSAs with MetLife and replacing them with more cost-effective solutions is essential to executing this strategy. We have made good progress and were able to exit 72 of our TSAs in 2017. We ended the year with 147 TSAs remaining. We will continue to prioritize exiting TSAs during 2018, and we believe this will put us in a position to begin reducing our expenses in the second half of the year.","As part of our strategy, we are also making necessary investments in our technology infrastructure and in our businesses. We refer to these investments as establishment costs. In the fourth quarter, establishment costs were approximately $72 million pretax.","Third, underwriting. We experienced elevated mortality in our life insurance businesses sequentially, but within normal quarterly variation. All in, the growth in expenses and unfavorable underwriting impacted results sequentially.","Finally, I'd like to provide a few comments on group annuity reserves. In December, MetLife announced that it was undertaking a review of the practices and procedures it uses to estimate its reserves related to certain group annuitants have been unresponsive or missing over time. And as a result of that review and based on information provided by MetLife, we have identified approximately 14,000 group annuitants across Brighthouse entities who may be owed annuity payments now or in the future. This drove a reserve increase of $38 million after tax in the quarter. This reserve increase related to legacy nonretail group annuity contracts that are all pension-risk transfer business in our Run-off segment and are administered by MetLife. We do not believe these issues impact the retail business that is also administered by MetLife as part of our TSAs.","Brighthouse Financial is committed to delivering on our promises. We are actively working with MetLife on this matter, are continuing to receive and review information and are monitoring for any other potential impacts. Anant will provide more detail on our fourth quarter results shortly.","Before I turn the call over to him, I want to spend a few minutes covering 2 regulatory items impacting our industry. Last year, I worked with a group of life insurance CEOs on Capitol Hill in an effort to achieve a balanced outcome for our industry, and I believe we achieved that outcome. Specifically, for Brighthouse, we expect to operate with a lower GAAP effective tax rate going forward and we recorded a favorable impact to book value of approximately $950 million in the quarter.","Another important regulatory item we are actively working through in 2018 is VA capital reform. As you may recall, we utilized the results of the quantitative impact study conducted for the NAIC Variable Annuity Reserve and Capital Reform initiative as an input as well as 1 additional year of our own experience in conducting our third quarter 2017 assumption review. And late last year, the current proposal and recommendations for VA capital reform were made public. We are supportive of the principles behind this initiative and believe it aligns with our view of managing to a total asset requirement. There are many details to work through with the regulators in 2018 including a 3-month public comment period, followed by a period of further regulator and industry engagement. Implementation would likely be year-end 2019 or later with a phase-in over a few years.","We have multiple levers that we can utilize to adapt to the impacts of evolving regulatory and capital requirements. For example, with our leverage ratio of approximately 22% and a target leverage ratio of 25%, we have significant financial flexibility to address any potential impacts. We remain focused on growing assets above CTE95 and managing through NAIC reform.","I began my remarks by noting that 2017 was a transformative year for Brighthouse Financial, and I feel very good about our progress relative to our plans. We expect 2018 will be an equally transformative year for the company, and we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the macro environment and proactively adjust to the evolving regulatory landscape.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Anant to discuss our fourth quarter financial results in more detail.","Anant Bhalla","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our results for the fourth quarter and provide some perspective on the key underlying themes. Net income in the quarter was $668 million compared to a net loss of approximately $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted earnings were $992 million in the quarter compared to an adjusted loss of $61 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our fourth quarter ending book value excluding accumulated other comprehensive income or AOCI was approximately $110 per share. Results in the fourth quarter included a $947 million favorable impact related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, also referred to as tax reform. Excluding the impact of tax reform, adjusted earnings would have been $45 million.","The enactment of tax reform during the quarter had a significant impact on our financial results. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing this impact and the implications from tax reform going forward.","A key element of tax reform involved remeasuring our deferred tax assets and liabilities on both a GAAP and statutory basis. The impact of this remeasurement increased stockholders' equity excluding AOCI by $947 million. However, the FASB is currently considering an accounting rule change to address an unintended impact of tax reform within the components of stockholders' equity. As a result, once the FASB's proposed change is adopted, we expect to reclassify approximately $300 million from AOCI to retained earnings. This will reduce stockholders' equity excluding AOCI by a corresponding amount, but will not change total stockholders' equity. We expect to reflect this in our year-end financial statements to be included in our 2017 10-K filing.","Book value excluding AOCI adjusted for this reclassification is estimated to be approximately $107 per share. On a statutory basis, after factoring in tax reform, there was a minimal change in admitted deferred tax assets and therefore a minimal impact on the combined total adjusted capital of our operating companies.","Our preliminary combined risk-based capital or RBC ratio as of year-end 2017 is estimated to be well in excess of 600%.","The industry and the NAIC are starting to work through how and when the NAIC will modify the RBC methodology to reflect the new tax environment. We estimate that our preliminary combined RBC ratio as of year-end 2017 would have been well in excess of 500% if the tax rates used in this calculation were changed from 35% to 21% at the end of the year.","On a go-forward basis, as a result of tax reform, we expect our adjusted earnings tax provision rate to be in the mid- to high teens. In terms of cash taxes that impact statutory results, we expect a negligible impact from tax reform in the next couple of years. Finally, we expect no change to our financial targets from tax reform. We continue to anticipate in our base case scenario an adjusted ROE of approximately 8% on average and over time and adjusted EPS annual growth of mid- to high single digits starting in 2019 as we reduce expenses.","When it comes to capital distribution to shareholders, under our base case scenario, we anticipate returning in excess of $1 billion of capital to shareholders through 2021. This expected level of capital return is consistent with our previously stated target of 50% to 70% of adjusted earnings. However, going forward, we expect to refer to a cash distribution target in terms of dollars of capital only given our focus on statutory results.","Turning back to earnings. In addition to the favorable impact of tax reform, there were 4 unfavorable notable items in the quarter that impacted adjusted earnings. These total $152 million after tax or $1.27 per share. Specifically, $53 million of reserve adjustments in the Run-off segment due to the recapture of reinsurance on universal life with secondary guarantees or ULSG, partially offset by reserve refinements; $47 million of establishment costs related to our technology transformation and branding initiatives; a $38 million increase in reserves in the Run-off segment for legacy nonretail group annuity contracts, these contracts are all pension-risk transfer business and are administered by MetLife; and finally, a $14 million tax additional item related to separation.","Now I'd like to provide some perspectives on 3 themes that impacted our overall financial performance this quarter. The first theme for the quarter is variable annuity exposure management. As a reminder, we are managing our variable annuity business to a total asset requirement floor level known as CTE95. CTE95 is defined as the amount of assets required to satisfy contract holder obligations across future market environments in the average of the worst 5% of a thousand capital market scenarios over the life of the contract. Assets above CTE95 were $2.6 billion, up $300 million on a sequential basis. We are very pleased with this result. The hedging program performed in line with our expectations, and combined with a strong equity market in the fourth quarter, contributed approximately $500 million to the growth in assets above CTE95. This was partially offset by the normal quarterly aging of CTE95 of approximately $200 million.","The second theme for the quarter is unfavorable underwriting. This impacted results across our life insurance businesses sequentially, primarily in the Run-off segment. Specifically, we saw incremental ULSG reserve growth and elevated mortality claims mainly due to increased severity. Sequentially, underwriting results negatively impacted adjusted earnings by about $45 million. While full year direct claims in 2017 were better than the prior year, we do have higher life mortality retention as a stand-alone company. And as we've previously shared, mortality results plus ULSG reserve changes can vary from quarter-to-quarter.","The last theme for the quarter I would like to discuss is expenses. Corporate expenses were $287 million pretax in the quarter, up approximately $46 million pretax compared to the third quarter of 2017. Corporate expenses do not include the $72 million of pretax or $47 million of after-tax impact of establishment costs that I mentioned earlier. As we make investments in our infrastructure over the next few years, we anticipate establishment costs to be approximately $40 million to $50 million after-tax per quarter. It is important to note that these establishment costs are already factored into our capital plan. Eric mentioned that one of our goals is to be a cost-competitive manufacturer over time. A tangible example of executing this goal is a recent partnership that we entered into with DXC Technology to outsource in-force administration and servicing, new business processing and support operations. This partnership with an industry-leading provider is expected to enable us to migrate to a more variable cost structure, thereby lowering our operating expenses over time. I look forward to updating you on our progress in this regard on future earnings calls.","Turning to results at the segment level. Adjusted earnings in the Annuities segment were $208 million in the quarter. Strong equity markets offset continued negative net flows, resulting in a $1.7 billion sequential increase in annuity account values to $133 billion. Sequentially, results reflected higher expenses, consistent with the increase in corporate expenses. Given its relative size, we allocate a majority of the corporate expenses to the Annuities segment.","Adjusted earnings in the Life segment were $5 million in the quarter, impacted by elevated mortality sequentially. The adjusted loss in the Run-off segment was $80 million in the quarter including unfavorable notable items of $91 million. ULSG mortality results and reserve growth were unfavorable sequentially. Expenses were also higher sequentially.","Let me close with an update on our capital position as of year-end 2017. First, preliminary combined total adjusted capital or TAC was $6.6 billion, in line with the prior quarter. Second, as I mentioned earlier, our preliminary combined risk-based capital or RBC ratio is estimated to be well in excess of 600%.","Third, variable annuity assets above CTE95 increased to $2.6 billion. Our plan is to grow the assets above CTE95 to $3 billion under our base case scenario. This is an important milestone before we begin returning capital to shareholders. Additionally, we anticipate updating our variable annuity and ULSG sensitivities in our mid-March Form 10-K filing. Fourth, liquid assets at the holding companies were $655 million or about 4x our expected annual fixed charges.","And finally, our leverage ratio of approximately 22% is below our target of 25%. This provides us financial flexibility in managing our overall capital position and allows us to be opportunistic in accessing the capital markets.","With that, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore.","Thomas Gallagher","First question on the ROE guidance. Anant, the 8% that you're still guiding to, despite having a pretty big drop in the expected GAAP tax rate, are you telling us that the run rate's likely to be lower than the old 8% ROE? Or is that not the right read on that?","Anant Bhalla","Thanks for the question. I think what we're really saying around that is that the approximate 8% on average over time is the guidance, no change from tax reform. Tax reform will be marginally better on the numerator, but the denominator did go up as well, so it rounds around 50 bps. It still stays approximately 8% on average over time.","Thomas Gallagher","So from the most recent run rate of 8%, on an apples-to-apples basis, would your view be that, that's still a good run rate despite some noise in this quarter?","Anant Bhalla","Yes, the approximate 8% is still approximate 8%.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay, I just wanted to confirm that. The -- and Eric, just a question on the regulatory changes with VA. I heard what you said about flexibility, the time frame around the implementation of the new rules and just a few questions around. Does that change your view at all in terms of the timing of potentially returning capital from 2020 given that uncertainty? Or do you feel like you have enough visibility where you actually are more confident that you're kind of on your way and you have enough flexibility to get there?","Eric Steigerwalt","Okay. So I'll try to thread that needle, Tom. Look, I think every management team hopes to beat their targets, right? And we're no different. We're working hard to execute on our strategy as fast as we can. I think I would wait until we get a little bit more into the year here, hear what's happening both with all the comments coming in and then the dialogue that's going to go back and forth between the industry and regulators and then we can have a little bit more of a basis to comment further. But I'm certainly willing to say that we want to execute on this strategy as fast as we possibly can. And if I see a point where we can update you on that, we certainly will do it.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. And Eric, if I could just slip one more in. Any -- in light of the Voya news about their variable annuity risk transfer deal, being mindful of the fact that you guys are in a different position because VA is such a big part of your overall business, do you think there's going to be potential opportunities for Brighthouse down the road here to utilize risk transfer to optimize capital in some way, shape or form?","Eric Steigerwalt","So here's what I would say about this. Obviously, there's interest in the marketplace. Everybody has seen these transactions. I've said and I'll repeat what I said on the last call, we are focused on executing on the strategy that we laid out and we laid it out in some detail. Having said that, we're always going to be evaluating our targets and we're always going to be flexible to what's going on in the marketplace. So we're executing on the strategy, but we see everything that's going on and we're continuously evaluating what's happening in the marketplace.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Just regarding the pension risk transfer business with Met, I was just wondering if the -- if any of the TSA agreements or any of the separation agreements would contain any potential indemnification whether it's -- to Brighthouse or to Met? Any kind of arrangement like that in the separation agreement?","Peter Carlson","Humphrey, this is Pete Carlson. Thanks for the question. As you would not be surprised, we're not in a position to say much about any specifics other than we are actively reviewing this matter with MetLife and we continue to receive information and review the information from them.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, got it. And then in terms of your CTE95 as a buffer, so it was definitely a good development in the fourth quarter, but first quarter is definitely a little bit weaker on the equity markets. The volatility did pick up. So if we were to assume the first quarter will end today based on where we are in terms of equity markets and the volatility, how should we think about the asset buffer compared to your target level?","Anant Bhalla","Humphrey, it's Anant. Thanks for the question. Well, we are very pleased with the way it performed in the fourth quarter, but let me take a step back and provide some perspective here. First of all, our hedging program utilizes more long-dated options with tenures between 1 to 3 years and some out even 5 years, right? Therefore, in any given quarter, we only have a fraction of the equity hedges that need to be rolled. To be specific, in each of like the first and the second quarter of this year, we have less than 10% of our equity option book that is coming up for rolling. Secondly, our cash flow projections in the Form 10 use long-term estimates for volatility in determining hedging costs, higher than where even current implied volatility is after the moves in February. So we feel very good about what we have and you'll see our updated sensitivities in the 10-K within mid-March.","Humphrey Lee","Yes. But I guess, what I'm trying to get at is so obviously the decline in the equity market in the first quarter will be a headwind to the asset level above CTE95, but I would assume the high volatility would be a potential offset. So I guess, hypothetically speaking, if we end at March 31 exactly where we are right now, should we expect the asset level above CTE95 to be slightly lower than the 2.6? Or how should we think about that?","Anant Bhalla","Okay. So let me break it up into the drivers and 2 drivers you can clearly see in the sensitivities that will be updated in the 10-K. One is interest rate's up. That's generally good and vice versa. Equity markets up is generally good and vice versa. So you can see the sensitivities from there that we would have. And finally, my point about volatility. Like we saw in the third quarter call, decline in implied volatility reduced the assets above CTE95. You could sort of in cue from that what vice versa would be. But I would go back to my point about the long-gated nature of our option book. Does that help?","Humphrey Lee","Yes, okay. And just for clarification of that $200 million of impact from the passage of time. Is that an annual impact? Or is that a quarterly impact?","Anant Bhalla","Quarterly.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.","Taylor Scott","So the first question I had was just around the 8% ROE kind of a follow-up on Tom's question. Could you just help us think about where the run rate came in after the significant items you called out this quarter, and I know you called out the mortality as well. But like what are some of the other things you'd point to that would sort of get us back closer to 8% ROE because I sort of adjust for these things and I'm around 100 basis points lower on ROE, so I'm just trying to think about the places where maybe there is a little bit of unfavorability elsewhere.","Anant Bhalla","Thanks, Alex. It's Anant. And I totally understand, it's hard to pin down segment run rates two quarters into being a public company. So feel for you there. Let me sort of give a little bit of explanation versus last quarter and this quarter, right, ex notables in this quarter. We had $152 million of notables, so you'd get to like $197 million ex notables. We've had a swing between last quarter expenses and mortality, both having been lower to now they're higher. What I would point on mortality is while we're sequentially $45 million worse, last quarter was $20 million better.","So I would look at $25 million being mortality in that and that's predominantly in ULSG. When it comes to expenses, last quarter, we had said we were $241 million, $15 million to $25 million pretext lower than what we would expect as a run rate. And this time, we are at $287 million. So if you sort of average those 2 quarters and look where it comes out, you would say expenses pretax at maybe around like $26 million-ish. So $15 million to $20 million post-tax. Those are what I would sort of give you as the building blocks to bridge 2 items that have been moving between the two quarters. Let me pause there.","Taylor Scott","Okay. And could you just provide some high-level commentary about the ROA in annuities of sort of the new business that you're putting on versus the old businesses running off just given the sales were good, net flows were still pretty negative based on some of the outflow, but I assume some of the outflow is probably less profitable. So just trying to think about how the mix shift of new sales versus losing some of the old will impact earnings over time.","Anant Bhalla","It's Anant again. Yes, to your point on the ROEs. Business that's running off versus business that's coming on, the one point I'd point you to as you look at the lines of the financial statement, Shield that's coming on is a lot of the new business coming on and it's not a fee-driven business. It's more an investment income-driven business, so I just point you to that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder Bhullar","I had a couple of questions. First, just if you could give us some details on the recaptured block and what drove the $58.3 million charge? And related to that, any impact of the recapture on your future earnings? I'm assuming that volatility and earnings will go up, but do you expect any impact on the base level of earnings in that business as well?","Anant Bhalla","Jimmy, it's Anant again. On the second question, let me take that one first. No impact going forward. And really, it was really a GAAP-driven impact, not a statutory impact when we recaptured it and that was a big driver of our decision there. To your first question of recapturing it, we look at reinsurance rates from time-to-time and we decided that it was prudent after looking at the rates and then economically on the book of business to recapture that. We had some slight mortality given our mix of business.","Jamminder Bhullar","And are the policy sizes or anything else, are they similar to your in-force block? Or would you expect a little bit more volatility in earnings because the policy sizes are higher?","Anant Bhalla","Nothing meaningful to comment on that. I think it's in line. It's a proportional share of our in-force block. So nothing peculiar that I would highlight for you on that. Largely in ULSG, so I would point that out. It's across both Life and ULSG. So you should see it in both going forward.","Jamminder Bhullar","Yes. And then on the charge for the group annuity business. Did you have any control over the whole process and then -- and just trying to determine your exposure independently? Or are you just reliant on whatever information you get from MetLife on that?","Peter Carlson","Jimmy, It's Pete Carlson again. What I'd just remind folks on is when we did the separation, we did along legal entity lines and that's how we ended up with this product. It was, in this case, mostly came from the Travelers acquisition, issued really prior to MetLife's acquisition of Travelers. MetLife, through the TSAs is the administrator of these policies. We do receive information from them. Based on that information, we recorded our reserve, but we -- they are the administrators of the business. We actively are working with them on this and continuing to receive and review information and monitoring for any other potential impacts.","Jamminder Bhullar","Okay. And then just lastly, clarifying on your ROE targets. I think your cash flows do include expected establishment costs, but the ROE targets do not, right?","Anant Bhalla","That is correct.","Jamminder Bhullar","Okay. And that $40 million after-tax, that's you said per quarter roughly?","Anant Bhalla","$40 million to $50 million after-tax per quarter, yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","I had a follow-up on volatility. I understand your longer-term comments about volatility, Anant. I was hoping you could give us some perspective on how to think about your sensitivity to increases in near-term volatility in terms of capital position. I guess, similar to the sensitivities you've given on equity markets and interest rates because, unless I'm incorrect, it seems like you would benefit from a capital standpoint from higher near-term volatility.","Anant Bhalla","You are right in that hypothesis. So I would agree with you on that because back to the point of having a long-dated option book, as volatility goes up we benefit. And what we saw in the third quarter volatility went down and we saw impact from markets and the hedging program not being as much as we had expected because of that. In the fourth quarter, while it was pretty flat, it went up just modestly. But since the end of the quarter through Friday evening, since things move around every day here, long-dated vol, 1 year vol is up around 4 to 5 points and 2-year vol is up around 2 to 3 points. So I'd leave it at that.","Ryan Krueger","I guess, is there anything you can help us with to think about the sensitivity to you from this?","Anant Bhalla","Ryan, I'd rather not give a sensitivity because these things change from time to time. Just look at what I said between 1-year and 2-year vol, right, I mean, there's such difference between the two. But up vol is good for us given our option book and vol is not above where we assumed when we came up with the hedge costs. So that's where I would leave it at.","Ryan Krueger","Got it. And then second question was with tax reform, you talked about the RBC impacts. Are there any -- the VA capital margin is not an RBC-based framework. Are there any impacts to how you think about and calculate the VA capital margin from tax reform on a go-forward basis?","Anant Bhalla","Thanks. That's a great question. Yes, we think of VA capital reform and tax reform impacts and the whole CTE calculation in combined way, so we think of them together. And we have, as Eric mentioned and I did in our comments, we have financial flexibility with leverage only at 22% to work through that.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. So there would likely be some negative impact, but you believe you can offset it with leverage?","Anant Bhalla","That's a fair point.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","Yes. I was wondering, first of all, if you can get into some detail on the $200 million of aging that occurred to the capital buffer or whatnot? How can we think about that in the future? Is this a recurring issue? Are we going to have to fight this on multiple quarters over the next few years? Sort of a framework for understanding that.","Anant Bhalla","Sure, happy to do so. Like we shared in our third quarter call, similarly in the fourth quarter call, now the buffer is impacted by how CTE95, the liability requirement changes. And naturally, in a quarter that goes up, in a scenario like our base case scenario, you would expect CTE95 to go up over time by $200 million a quarter. As insurance liabilities age, it's almost going -- your requirements are going up till they peak and then they go down as we had highlighted in our Form 10 and will update in the 10-Q.","Joshua Shanker","So we should expect on a normal year $800 million of aging moving against the increasing elements of the CTE buffer?","Anant Bhalla","That's right because I'd point you back to we collect almost $3 billion of fees in this business. So if you think of inflows coming in, in fees and one of the costs of that is funding your total asset requirements, reserves and capital. So around $300 million comes in each year, and to your point, around $200 million a quarter, $800 million a year would be the natural funding of the growth of the buffer.","Joshua Shanker","Okay. And in terms of businesses that you picked up on the statutory basis during the separation, group annuity, we didn't really have a great grasp and obviously because it's not core business do you. Are there other businesses of size that can be affected by Met's own investigation that we're not so familiar with as a noncore business that's nearly been put to you due to statutory separation?","Peter Carlson","Josh, it's Pete again. Thanks for the question. Yes, we talk about 2.7 million policyholders across all of the Brighthouse policies. For this group annuitant business, you're probably, in this pension risk transfer, you're talking 140,000 or so and less than 100,000 of those are actually in payout. When we look at it from a reserve basis, it's in the 2% to 3% of our total reserve so it's not overly significant. And what we have looked at overall, based on the information we have received from MetLife to date, we do not believe these matters impact the retail business that is also administered by MetLife as part of the TSA.","Eric Steigerwalt","It's Eric. I would just add to that. If you look in the filings in the Form 10, et cetera, you can see there's a structured settlement business. That's the one I would probably point to as, I think, that was the essence of your question there, is there anything else. Obviously, we're very focused on the retail business, and now as we've said a couple of times here on this call, we don't believe that there's any issues with the retail business. But theoretically, there could be an issue in the structured settlement business. I don't know of any issue, but I think that was the essence of your call so -- of your question. So hopefully, that helps.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Anant, I want to go back to this passage of time concept. If I look at the base case from the Form 10, it looks like over a 3-year period, the passage of time would equate to something like $400 million per year, maybe $350 million per year. So I guess, I'm curious, under that, why is it closer to $200 million per quarter or $800 million per year? Am I missing a piece of it?","Anant Bhalla","I would point you to the sensitivities when we update them in the 10-K. But as I spoke last time in the third quarter call, it is around $200 million a year. So we can take that off-line and walk you through it, so it's helpful. $200 million a quarter, sorry.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. But it seems like there was change here relative to what's in the Form-10?","Anant Bhalla","No. We can sort of point to it on that like I did on the last call, I'd just point you back to my comments there. If you triangulate between 256, 257, I have to be careful because the Form 10 is a bit old now so I would really want you to look at the 10-K. But even if you look at that, page 256, 257 versus the instantaneous sensitivities, you can sort of see how passage of time gives us around $200 million a quarter in the base case.","Suneet Kamath","Yes. I'm on 256 and I see that $1.1 billion in the base case.","Anant Bhalla","Yes, so when we look at that, it should translate to $200 million. I don't have my Form 10 in front of me, but we can walk you through that off-line.","Suneet Kamath","Okay, that'd be helpful. And then, I guess, on the Oliver Wyman study, can you maybe highlight just some other variables that you're seeing in the most recent update and how they could compare to what you're currently assuming? The premise is kind of back to this idea that you have the flexibility to reflect any of these changes and I just want to get a sense of which variables we should be focusing on?","Anant Bhalla","Sure, thanks for that question. As Eric mentioned, the dialogue and comment period will take a little bit of time to work its way through 2018 over here. However, to your specific point on the variable, there are 28 specific recommendations, if memory serves me right, which I would group into, one, 3 to 4 structural categories and the last category being how people are calibrating or parameterizing the methodology. So on the structural categories, first, it's about managing to a total asset requirement or TAR based on a high CTE requirement, just like our CTE95. So we're aligned with that. Second, it's the use of the standard scenario not as a binding requirement over the high CTE standard, but more as a validation on the impact of different companies' actuarial assumptions and models.","So it's almost a validation point and where it's going to work. There's prescribed assumptions anchored in industry data like what we did in our assumption update last quarter, but at a lower CTE like I think we're talking about CTE65, so it's a validation point. And third, incentivizing long-term hedging, not just short term, and increasing disclosure, all which is congruent with the way we've designed our strategy, the way we are executing our strategy and now growing the buffer. So I rarely then go structurally. Those are my comments on the 28 proposals. Finally, it boils down to the last category of calibration of a model or parameterization of a model and that will be the focus of dialogue over the coming year, how do you calibrate scenario definitions, whether it's equity returns or interest rates? Do you look from 1955 to now? Do you go back to the '20s? Do you go back to the 1800s? And then this is a long-term business and you have to look at the long-term nature of the business and what that means for these definitions and then what CTE you pick, 93, 95, 98. That was a mouthful so I'm going to pause, but hopefully you got what you're looking for.","Suneet Kamath","No, that's helpful. Just the last one on this. So between Oliver Wyman and tax reform, it seems like there could be some negative impacts on capital, but you think that you have the financial flexibility in terms of leverage, but also holding company cash to deal with both of them?","Eric Steigerwalt","Suneet, it's Eric. Here's what I would say. I think as we look at it from today's point of view, I would agree with what you just said. I mean, this -- we mentioned specifically the dialogue continues. You get more information, et cetera, et cetera. But I would agree with what you just laid out.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan with Wells Fargo.","Sean Dargan","I have a question about the relationship between total adjusted capital and the CTE95 buffer. So tax was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, but you did have a nice bump up in the buffer. Is that just because the CTE95 calculation is more sensitive to market movements? Or how should we think about that?","Anant Bhalla","Sean, you're spot on right. The blue books are not on a CTE95 basis. Standard scenario, which really drives the blue books, is less sensitive to markets than CTE95. So you got it.","Sean Dargan","Okay. And then you may hit that targeted buffer maybe sooner than people were thinking, maybe not. But will you put out -- will you ask the board for a share repurchase authorization as soon as you hit that buffer? Or are you going to want to stay at that level for a couple of quarters to make sure that you're -- you have better insight into staying at that level?","Eric Steigerwalt","Sorry, Sean, I had my mic off. It's Eric. So we're in our second quarter here as a public company and I would say we're having discussions just like that with the board. We're watching the buffer build and stay tuned. Obviously, even what I just said is consistent with we love to be able to go faster than our targets. But we're in our second quarter as a public company, so stay tuned. But these conversations are certainly being had with the board.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Eric Bass with Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","You've mentioned the significant liquidity at the holding company and -- well above your targets and it increased quarter-over-quarter. I guess, as you think about that going forward, would you expect the liquidity level to start to decline since you're not taking or not planning to take dividends from BLIC?","Anant Bhalla","Yes, it's Anant. We are holding on 4x our fixed charge coverage. We're not planning to take dividends from BLIC till we build up to $3 billion of assets above CTE95, so yes. And our long-term targets are to be like 2x, not 4x.","Erik Bass","Got it. But so over the course of 2018, you would expect that directionally to move lower?","Anant Bhalla","Yes.","Erik Bass","Okay. And then can you walk through how higher interest rates would affect your capital and balance sheet, and you mentioned the positive impacts certainly for the VA book. But are there any negative short-term implications for capital given the swaps used to hedge the ULSG well block?","Anant Bhalla","On a stack basis, high interest rates, generally speaking, for the life insurance business is good. On a GAAP basis, I think you've hit the nail on the head there, the ULSG block in the Run-off segment is fairly insensitive on GAAP, you see that in our sensitivity filings. But we do hedge the true economic risk of that and stack risk on that using swaps. We did dial up using options and not just swaps, so we've got a balanced mix there. But that's correct, we would see impact on GAAP equity because that's not in operating earnings. It's below the line from those swaps from mark-to-market movements. And I would just point you to sensitivities that we update in the 10-K because we'll also reflect the change in tax rates at 21% versus 35% when we do that.","Erik Bass","Got it. But there are no RBC impact?","Anant Bhalla","No, we've done our cash flow testing analysis as well on a preliminary basis and we feel pretty good about that even though it's preliminary.","Operator","And this does conclude today's Q&A session. So I'd like to return the call to Mr. David Rosenbaum for any closing remarks.","David Rosenbaum","Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call and for your interest in Brighthouse Financial. We look forward to talking again next quarter. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating today's conference.

My name is Sandra, and I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the presentation over to David Rosenbaum, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Rosenbaum, you may proceed.","David Rosenbaum","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining Brighthouse Financial's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Our earnings release, presentation and financial supplement were released last night and can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at brighthousefinancial.com. We encourage you to review all of these materials, and we will refer to the slide presentation in our prepared remarks.","Today, you will hear from Eric Steigerwalt, our President and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Anant Bhalla, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer period. Also here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of senior management. Our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Brighthouse Financial's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in Brighthouse Financial's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Information discussed on today's call speaks only as of today, May 8, 2018. The company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed on today's call.","During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles, also known as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related definitions may be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website, in our earnings release, slide presentation and financial supplement. And finally, references to statutory results are preliminary due to the timing of the filing of the statutory statement.","And now I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Steigerwalt.","Eric Steigerwalt","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our results in the first quarter of 2018, including our strong adjusted earnings performance and outstanding quarter-over-quarter sales growth. I also feel very good about our progress relative to our plans. We have a solid strategy in place, and it is working. Our focus is on executing with respect to the key elements of our strategy, including, offering a tailored set of annuity and life insurance solutions that are simpler, more transparent and provide value to advisers, their clients and our shareholders; selling our products through a broad well-established network of independent distribution partners; and leveraging our financial discipline to manage our expenses and our balance sheet.","Our top priorities in 2018 reflect the following goals. First, we are focused on exiting our transition service agreements, or TSAs, with MetLife. Exiting TSAs supports our goal of reducing our overall cost structure as a stand-alone company. Second, we are enhancing our distribution platform and network and developing new products that respond to the evolving needs of our advisers and the clients that they serve. And third, actively managing through NAIC variable annuity capital reform and growing our earnings power.","With that as a backdrop, I will now discuss four topics, first, I'll touch on progress made on the product and distribution front; next, I will make a few comments on our first quarter results; third, I will provide an update on NAIC VA capital reform; and lastly, I will provide some perspectives on three key measures to help investors and analysts better understand Brighthouse Financial.","Let me start with product and distribution. I am very pleased with our annuity sales results in the first quarter of 2018. Annuity sales of approximately $1.3 billion were up 35% quarter-over-quarter driven by Shield and fixed indexed annuities. Sales of Shield annuities were $729 million in the quarter, up 59% quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter growth in annuity sales reflects the strength of our distribution relationships and the ongoing momentum from our targeted advertising campaigns. To that end, in April, we rolled out a new campaign designed to further build brand awareness and showcase our flagship Shield annuities.","Now I'd like to take a moment to provide a few comments on our first quarter results. First, CTE95. I'm very pleased that the assets above CTE95 increased to $2.7 billion. Our hedging strategy continues to perform well. This quarter's performance is another proof point that the hedge strategy we put in place to operate Brighthouse on a stand-alone basis is working.","Second, our corporate expenses were $230 million in the quarter. This is down from the fourth quarter, but we continue to expect between $1 billion and $1.1 billion of expenses in our first year post separation. Additionally, we expect corporate expenses in the second and third quarters of this year to be the high watermark for expenses, consistent with the expense levels in the fourth quarter of 2017. As I've said before, a part of our business strategy is to be a cost-competitive product manufacturer.","Exiting TSAs with MetLife and replacing them with more cost-effective solutions is essential to executing on this strategy. We began the year with 147 TSAs remaining, and we were able to exit eight in the first quarter. Consistent with our strategy, we fully intend to begin reducing expenses in 2019.","We are also making necessary investments in our technology infrastructure and in our businesses. We refer to these investments as establishment costs. In the first quarter, establishment costs were approximately $47 million pretax. Third, underwriting results were improved sequentially and in line with expectations for the first quarter. And finally, taxes were lower, as expected, as a result of tax reform.","Let me turn now to NAIC VA capital reform. We remain actively involved in this important regulatory initiative. We are supportive of the principles behind this process and believe it aligns with our view of managing to a total asset requirement. As we said last quarter, there are many details to work through with the regulators in 2018. In March, the NAIC held its spring meeting where regulators and industry participants discussed approximately 1\/3 of the proposals. While there is more work to do, we believe the discussions have been constructive. As a reminder, implementation would likely be year-end 2019 or later, with a phase-in over a few years.","We have multiple levers that we can utilize to adapt to the impacts of evolving regulatory and capital requirements. We have significant financial flexibility to address potential impacts, and we remain focused on growing assets above CTE95 and managing through NAIC reform. Before I turn the call over to Anant, I want to provide a few perspectives on three key measures to help investors better understand Brighthouse and to provide a baseline for our foundational year as a new company. These measures are summarized on Slide 3 of our first quarter earnings call presentation.","The first is adjusted earnings per share. As I mentioned earlier, our adjusted earnings were strong this quarter. Many of the key drivers of performance were favorable. And as you know, these can vary quarter-to-quarter. As such, in our base case scenario, we project adjusted earnings per share of $8.50 to $9 for 2018, excluding notable items. We continue to expect an annual growth rate for EPS in the mid- to high single-digit range over the next few years.","The second measure I'd like to discuss is adjusted return on equity or ROE. Adjusted ROE is an important metric for Brighthouse. In our Form 10 filing, in connection with the separation, we established targets for selected financial metrics, including adjusted ROE. Since that filing, separation-related transactions in the second and third quarter of 2017 and tax reform in the fourth quarter of 2017 had a substantial impact on our balance sheet. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2018, we began to reposition our investment portfolio. Specifically, we rotated almost $2 billion of treasuries into higher-yielding spread assets with the goal of improving investment income in 2018 and beyond. With all of this in mind, we still expect an approximately 8% adjusted ROE in 2018, but we now expect growth in adjusted ROE in both 2019 and 2020. In our base case, expense reduction begins in 2019, and capital return begins in 2020.","With the previously mentioned 2017 separation-related transaction impacts, VA hedging migration and tax reform now behind us, portfolio repositioning, expense reduction and capital return drive the improvement in expected adjusted ROE. We expect to provide more details on adjusted ROE growth targets later this year as clarity on NAIC VA capital reform emerges. The final measure I'd like to discuss is establishment costs. As you can see on Slide 3, we anticipate establishment costs of approximately $235 million pretax in 2018 reducing to approximately $40 million pretax in 2020. It is important to note that these costs are already factored into our capital plan. These costs are a critical component of our strategy as we build out our technology infrastructure to support our needs as a stand-alone company and expand our branding initiatives to make Brighthouse Financial a recognized and respected name throughout the United States.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Anant to discuss our first quarter financial results in more detail. Anant?","Anant Bhalla","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our performance in the quarter. We had a good start to the year, generating strong adjusted earnings. And our hedge strategy had solid performance in the quarter. Before I discuss our results for the first quarter, let me explain some additional slides that we have provided last night. Specifically, Slides 4 through 6 that summarize the financial and risk profile of our variable annuity business as of year-end 2017. These three slides were previously furnished on March 16 on Form 8-K in conjunction with the filing of the underlying tables in our 2017 annual report. The key takeaway from these three slides is the meaningful improvement in the expected financial and risk profiles of the in-force variable annuity business as of year-end 2017 compared to year-end 2016. More specifically, in the five capital market scenarios that we provide to you last update our financial profile, the following is observable, distributable earnings are expected to be higher driven by lower future expected hedge costs; the risk profile is projected to be improved as seen in the lower variability of cash flows across the five scenarios; assets above CTE95 are projected to reach $3 billion by year three in the base case and in scenarios 2, 3 and 4.; finally, the present value of cash flows over the lifetime of the book of business is also expected to be improved in scenarios 3, 4 and 5 driven by market performance in 2017.","Now with that background, let me move on to discuss the first quarter results and provide some perspectives on the key underlying themes beginning on Slide 7. Adjusted earnings were strong in the quarter at $283 million compared to adjusted earnings of $280 million in the first quarter of 2017. Notable items were small in the quarter with two items that impacted adjusted earnings for a total unfavorable of $5 million after-tax impact or $0.04 per share.","Now I'd like to provide some perspectives on the 5 themes related to our adjusted earnings this quarter. The first theme for the quarter that I would like to discuss is expenses. Corporate expenses were $230 million pretax in the quarter, down approximately $57 million pretax compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This result is approximately $25 million after tax or $0.21 per share lower than our quarterly expectations, which are based on full year corporate expenses of $1 billion to $1.1 billion in the first full year post separation, as seen on Slide 8. Additionally, similar to prior quarters, corporate expenses do not include the establishment costs, which we expect as a notable item through 2020, as Eric outlined on Slide 3.","The second theme for the quarter is the investment portfolio. Net investment income was higher sequentially, primarily driven by an increase in alternate investment income. Alternate investment income was approximately $15 million after tax or $0.13 per share higher than the four-quarter historical average for 2017, as seen on Slide 8. This performance is related to strong results from private equity funds, which we report on a one-quarter lag.","Staying with invested assets, I would also like to note that in the first quarter of 2018, we completed our realignment of assets across our segments, now all based on statutory target asset requirements. Prior to this, assets in each segment were based on a GAAP methodology. While this asset realignment did not change our earnings in total, it did and we expect it will continue to have an impact on our segment results. Specifically, the impact will be beneficial to the life insurance segment and, to a lesser extent, the Annuities segment.","The third theme is the impact of equity market performance in the first quarter. DAC amortization was about $10 million after tax or $0.09 higher than our expectation in the base case scenario.","The next theme is underwriting. Underwriting results were solid and improved sequentially by approximately $20 million after tax. These underwriting results across the segments were in line with expectations for the current quarter.","And lastly, taxes. On a sequential basis, earnings benefited from a lower effective tax rate driven by tax reform. Specifically, the effective tax rate decreased from roughly 25% last quarter to approximately 14% this quarter, with a sequential benefit to earnings of approximately $25 million. This effective tax rate is at the low end of our expected range of a mid- to high-teens GAAP tax rate, driven primarily by timing differences during the year.","Now turning to results at the segment level. Adjusted earnings in the Annuities segment were $226 million in the quarter. Sequentially, results reflected higher net investment income, lower expenses and lower taxes, partially offset by higher DAC amortization given the equity market performance this quarter. Net flows and first quarter separate account fund performance resulted in a $3.2 billion sequential decrease in annuity account values to $130 billion.","Adjusted earnings in the Life segment were $66 million in the quarter, including a favorable notable item of $16 million related to the reinsurance recapture noted last quarter. Sequentially, net investment income was approximately $30 million higher pretax due to portfolio realignment, and taxes were lower. Additionally, Life underwriting results were favorable on a sequential basis.","Adjusted earnings in the Run-off segment were $50 million in the quarter, including a favorable notable item of $16 million related to the previously mentioned reinsurance recapture. Sequentially, underwriting performance, expenses and taxes were all favorable.","Corporate & Other had an adjusted loss of $59 million and included a $37 million unfavorable notable item for establishment costs. Expenses were lower sequentially, partially offset by lower net investment income in Corporate & Other related to the portfolio realignment into the business segment.","Let me close with an update on our capital position as of March 31, 2018. First, with respect to our variable annuity exposure management program, results were solid in the quarter. Assets above CTE95 were $2.7 billion, up $100 million in the quarter. In a fairly volatile quarter for capital market with higher interest rates and volatility and mixed performance across equity indices, we saw solid performance from our hedging program. Second, our leverage capacity and holding company liquid assets were consistent with the prior quarter's levels.","With that, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","First, want to go back to the NAIC variable annuity process. I appreciate the update there. But just wondering if you could provide any color on what are the next steps and when you expect to get more clarity on the final standard.","Anant Bhalla","Erik, it's Anant. Thank you for the question. We had - as Eric mentioned in our prepared remarks, we worked throughout 1\/3 of the proposals at the meeting in March. There's another meeting on, actually, May 16. We're actively involved in this. It's constructive, and we expect to update you in the second half of this year.","Erik Bass","Got it. And I mean, what are the key debates, I guess? And what are the pieces that you're most concerned about getting clarity on to feel comfortable, whether it's returning capital or just with your - I guess, your capital positioning?","Anant Bhalla","First of all, we feel very confident about our ability to manage through this, a, based on our cash flows and our leverage capacity, as we mentioned in the past. So we feel very confident of being able to manage through this. It boils down to your question that a few moving parts, there were 28 proposals. Of those, we, in the last call, shared what categories to think of them in. The standard scenario reform is important. That probably is going to be the focus of the May 16 conversation. The scenarios are moving as expected. So second half of this year, we'll be able to update you. It's about the timing of returning capital. We have the resources to manage through this with the levels we mentioned.","Erik Bass","Got it. And maybe just last one on the annuities. Could you just talk about the level of consumer and adviser interest in annuity products and how that shifted over the past couple of quarters? And I guess, given the pickup in volatility, are you seeing any differences in the level of interest in buffered products?","Eric Steigerwalt","Erik, it's Eric. I'll let Myles Lambert, who I'm not sure have spoken on any of these calls yet. Myles is in charge of all distribution and marketing. Myles, why don't you give some color here?","Myles Lambert","Sure. Thank you, Eric. So we remain very bullish on the buffered annuities base, in particular. As Eric mentioned during his opening comments, we were very pleased with our sales results for the quarter. Our Shield product at $729 million of sales, up 59% quarter-over-quarter, and our expectations are that we're going to continue to see that type of momentum, especially in light of some of the marketing campaigns that we're working on now.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan with Wells Fargo.","Sean Dargan","I just have a question about the guidance to make sure we're level setting expectations. So the $8.50 to $9 assumes a normalized, was it, $2.40 in the first quarter? And the way you're going to be reporting adjusting earnings going forward will include establishment costs, but this $8.50 to $9 will exclude the establishment costs. Is that way we should think about it?","Anant Bhalla","Yes.","Sean Dargan","Okay. All right. And so that excluding the establishment costs is the way you're getting us to focus on that 8% ROE?","Anant Bhalla","Yes.","Sean Dargan","Okay. And then, so looking out to the out-years, the EPS growth rate is the same. And now you're telling us that there - we should expect some growth in adjusted ROE in 2019. And I thought before we were kind of pointed to a similar ROE in 2019. So if the base case is we're not going to be returning capital in 2020, where will that ROE expansion be coming from in 2019?","Anant Bhalla","2019, we start ROE expansion. As Eric mentioned in his comments, we'll get expense reduction going and then capital return in 2020.","Sean Dargan","Okay. So any ROE expansion in 2019 will be coming from expense reduction.","Anant Bhalla","Plus the investment portfolio repositioning that we mentioned.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with UBS.","John Nadel","A question on - I'm just wondering if you could update us on the net cost that you incurred in the quarter and you expect to incur going forward related to the hedging program. And I was just wondering if you would consider splitting out that cost from the change in fair value that we're seeing coming through the results. I think you're indicating that with an update to your scenarios that you expect those actual hedge costs to decline relative to your prior expectations. So if you could give us some dimensioning on that, that would be very helpful.","Anant Bhalla","John, It's Anant. Happy to break it out for you. So as you rightly mentioned, there's the derivative mark-to-market that goes through NDGL, which is approximately $1 billion. The way I would break it out is in this quarter, you had ULSG hedges, which were around $450 million with rising rates. As we've previously mentioned, the GAAP liability is fairly insensitive; the stat liability is protected in the way we hedge. If you eliminate the ULSG hedging mark-to-market, the VA program by itself had around $371 million, as you can see on Page 16 of the supplement. Embedded in that is the concept of when we think of hedge costs at an option program, it's really one of the value of an option decay as time goes by because if nothing happens in markets, you give up a cost of the option. That, over our projection period, should come down, and it runs around $200 million as we think about it.","John Nadel","And that $200 million, Anant, is that an annual cost or a quarterly cost?","Anant Bhalla","That's the quarterly. It can be $200 million to $250 million a quarter, so around $800 million to $1 billion a year. When you look at our GMLB Rider P&L, we have around $800 million a year of fees from the riders, and we want those to offset the time decay of options as they expire.","John Nadel","Okay. And so the way we - and that's why I was sort of talking about net cost. So the net cost we should be thinking about, the roughly $800 million of rider fees, which is used effectively to fund the option costs. And so the net rate now between the two is the net drag in the range of a couple hundred million dollars, and I assume that's pretax?","Anant Bhalla","That is correct. And when you look at the rider P&L this quarter on the VA business, we saw a fair amount of convergence between operating and net income because the rider P&L was pretty much flat.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","First question, can you give us a sense of where you think your debt capacity is at this point?","Anant Bhalla","Ryan, good morning. So debt capacity is really a range as you think about traditional debt or more rating agency-friendly hybrid kind of debt. We would put it in the $500 million to $1 billion-plus range.","Ryan Krueger","Got it. And then just a follow-up on the portfolio repositioning. The $2 billion that you've done so far, is that - are you anticipating additional repositioning going forward? Or was what you already did pretty much the repositioning?","John Rosenthal","Ryan, it's John Rosenthal. We would anticipate continuing to rotate out of treasuries over time - more treasuries over time.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Just on the CTE95 with Voya disposing their block pretty soon if we look at sort of the public universe of VA companies. It seems like most other companies are CTE97 or 98. So I guess, how do you get comfort being at the CTE95 level?","Eric Steigerwalt","Well, Suneet, it's Eric. I'll start. So we're at CTE98 plus when you think about the buffer. The whole notion here is that through a cycle, we will floor out at CTE95. And the way we got comfortable with that is, first, going through the design of the program; but then, second, walking the rating agencies through it over numerous months before we went public. That gave us great comfort. They understand it. They understand that the notion is through the cycle. And I think sometimes, people might get confused. We're well above CTE95 right now, well above it. Anant, anything you want to add?","Anant Bhalla","Eric covered it, Suneet. Well, to maybe emphasize this, we're at 98-plus like Eric said. And 95 is the floor across markets, and everyone appreciates the clarity on - of floor to protect.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And so then if we just think about the philosophy around capital returns. So let's assume you get to your buffer of $3 billion, you change the hedging strategy, you start to distribute earnings. And if we're in a flat market from that point for a year, would that fee - would that buffer essentially go down to around $2.2 billion because of that $200 million per quarter passage-of-time concept?","Anant Bhalla","That concept you outlined is in the range of possibilities, I would say, yes, because you can see the difference between scenario one and scenario four. That's sort of what that outlines.","Suneet Kamath","Okay, but in that environment where the buffer is coming down to around $2 billion, let's say, $2.2 billion, the presumption is that you would still be comfortable distributing earnings in terms of share repurchase over that period even as the buffer is approaching $2 billion?","Eric Steigerwalt","Yes, depending - Suneet, depending on what's going on, I mean, you'd have to take environmental factors into consideration. But yes, I mean, even as we sit here now, the buffer is at $2.7 billion, and we've thrown out this $3 billion target to get to. But I would say really where we are now, it's all about VA capital reform. I mean, we're a big variable annuity company. You all know that. And as a result, I don't think it would be prudent for us to think about this until we get this clarity. Now the clarity isn't long in coming. We expect it sometime around the end of the summer or in the fall, and I think that's the key measure. I mean, whether the buffer is a $2.9 billion or a $3 billion, that differential, I don't think to me, is anywhere near as important as understanding VA capital reform and then thinking about, and obviously discussing with our board, capital returns. So I know I added some things here, but I think to your main point, yes, we expected the buffer will eventually slip below $3 billion. And VA capital reform behind us and taking into consideration some environmental impacts, we'd be comfortable continuing to return capital.","Suneet Kamath","Yes, makes sense. Maybe just one numbers one if I could. Just on the lapse rate for the deep in the money VA. I remember on the third quarter call, I think you reduced your GAAP assumption to around 1.5%. Do you know - can you give us what that assumption is sort of what's embedded in your CTE calculation in terms of the lapse rate? Is it the same number? Is it something different?","Anant Bhalla","It's the same.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse.","Andrew Kligerman","First question, just back to what John was asking about a few questions ago. Could you reconcile your presented $1.6-plus billion in gross hedging costs to the numbers that you provided to John? And I'm not talking about the rider fees. I get that $800 million, but more the gross $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion?","Anant Bhalla","Andrew, it's Anant. So the gross $1.6-ish billion number that you referenced for the year, if you look at it for the quarter, the VA program was around just shy of $400 million. And you can see that in the NDTL line.","Andrew Kligerman","Right. And okay, so that's - so if you multiply that times four, that's $1.2 billion - I mean, $1.6 billion, right? So you've got...","Anant Bhalla","Right.","Andrew Kligerman","So you were telling John, though, $200 million to $250 million in cost a quarter?","Anant Bhalla","In that $371 million, so John was dissecting - okay, you got total derivative mark-to-market of let's just say $400 million to stay with your example. Is that good?","Andrew Kligerman","Yes.","Anant Bhalla","Right. Using isolate out derivative mark-to-market versus what you think is cost, you take cash and you buy derivative, it has some value. So that's not really cost. Cost is if what you buy expires worthless, the time value of that option. And that's around $200 million to $250 million a year - a quarter, sorry. So it becomes $800 million to $1 billion a year.","Andrew Kligerman","I see. Okay. Got you. And just in terms of the March sensitivity that you put out, what changed from the Form 10 that allowed you to, I guess, pun intended, make the house a little brighter in terms of improved sensitivity? What type of sensitivity input was different in March versus what you did in the Form 10?","Eric Steigerwalt","You want me to start?","Anant Bhalla","Much better.","Eric Steigerwalt","If you check my prepared remarks, Andrew, you'll kind of see a litany of them laid out. One is you had - look, we knew there were going to be separation-related impacts. We knew that, and we couldn't be sure when those were going to end. So that's number one, and they were pretty big. Two, you had tax reform on the horizon. And there, we really couldn't anticipate what was going to happen. As you may remember when you back there, it was touch and go there with respect to what was going to happen. So we - it would just be impossible to project that. And then three, part and parcel of what John Rosenthal was talking about, this repositioning of the portfolio, we were working through all our modeling, liquidity modeling, et cetera, to figure out what and when we could reposition the portfolio. And so as those became clear, then we got more comfort in saying, in fact, you will see ROE growth here. Now I can't quantify that yet because, of course, VA reform is going to come in there, and that will have - whatever we do there will have GAAP effects, as you well know. So at this point, I feel comfortable, very comfortable in saying that we will have ROE accretion. And by the way, it'll be meaningful. I'm not - I wouldn't have said it if we were talking about 20 basis points here, okay? And so hopefully, when we get VA capital reform understood, as I said again maybe late summer, early fall, then we'll put out some targets. Anant, you want to add anything there?","Anant Bhalla","Well, Eric covered the ROE part. I'll just add to the meaningful improvement in VA statutory distributable cash flows that we put out in the few slides. That's driven by lower hedge gains and losses, and that's driven by two primary things. First of all, the strategy to execute it. We can see that we're being - we are optimizing relative to what we put out in the Form 10. And secondly, the more tangible measure that you can actually probably put your arms around is we made a tax selection at year-end 2017, which allows us to look at hedging needs on a pretax basis and not a post-tax basis. That's beneficial because we need to hedge less. We need less hedge gains in a stress. So we leave it at that, and Andrew we'll take any follow-up you have.","Andrew Kligerman","Yes, just clarify that pretax, after-tax basis on the hedge again just to come back to that.","Anant Bhalla","Sure. Historically, if we had gains on - from hedges in a market correction, we'd have to pay taxes on those gains. We had some tax friction. We made a tax selection at the end of 2017 separate from tax reform. We made a tax selection that does not have that tax friction. So now when you look for a hedge gain in a market correction, we're not paying for tax friction. So we need to hedge a little less because we don't have to compensate for tax friction anymore. We're marking and spreading the hedge mark-to-market for taxes over a number of years versus having to realize it immediately.","Andrew Kligerman","And that had an impact - a material impact on the net present value in some of those sensitivities?","Anant Bhalla","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.","Joshua Shanker","Yes. Please correct me if I'm missing something where I think you said in the prepared remarks that corporate overhead was high in 4Q '17, would be high in 2Q '18 and 3Q '18, but low in 1Q '18. If that's right, why is that variable? And what's the difference between corporate overhead and establishment costs that would be variable in that regard?","Anant Bhalla","It's Anant. Corporate expenses are basically expenses of running the company, all the functions. Think of the finance department, the cost of running the finance department. And that gets sprinkled across each of the segments. So it's not only in Corporate & Other. It's in Annuities. It's in Life. It's in Run-off and Corporate & Other. Those expenses, as Eric mentioned in our comments, were at $230 million, less than our $1 billion to $1.1 billion range. So around - and we've given the estimate on Slide 7, the difference over there. Establishment costs are really onetime-ish in nature through 2020, which are the cost of building out our infrastructure, our technology, our brand. And that's the difference.","Joshua Shanker","No, I get that. My question, I guess, is I would just think that corporate overhead costs would be fairly consistent quarter-to-quarter. Sometimes some of these companies that obviously pay out bonuses in 1 quarter, which would make that elevate, but why would we - why would corporate costs, I guess, over - and I'm understanding what you're talking about there. Why would they bounce around behind the variable quarter-to-quarter? And maybe is 4Q '18 a run rate for a normal sort of corporate cost expectation?","Eric Steigerwalt","Josh, it's Eric. I'll start. Anant, you're probably going to want to jump in here. But look, think about marketing costs. You think about seasonality of sales, well, you've got marketing costs, seasonality as well. Consulting costs, projects and the other one doesn't finish at the same time here. I mean, you're going to have some lumpiness here in the first 4 or 5 quarters. We expected that, and it's just not perfectly projectable. And so we're giving a little guidance here, so that you can understand that we can only project so much. We're running the business day to day. And as those costs then fall out, in one quarter it's higher, in one quarter it's lower. Eventually, I agree with you, those will normalize. And I think they'll be much easier to project. Do you want to add anything?","Anant Bhalla","You've covered it, Eric. And first quarter generally is running lighter for the reasons Eric said, consulting, marketing. And we've outlined some of the impacts of that.","Joshua Shanker","Okay. And then investment income on the Corporate & Other side. What kind of investment - I guess, what kind of assets fall into that Corporate & Other category as opposed to segment investment income?","Anant Bhalla","So just to clarify, you're asking about the investment realignment between the segments?","Joshua Shanker","No, if you look through the various segments in the Corporate & Other, there's an NII component in there that doesn't feel related to a product necessarily. I'm wondering - and that's also a little bit variable. I'm trying to understand how to model that out.","Anant Bhalla","Sure. There's a legacy direct business in there, which is very small. It'll have some reserves and some NII on those reserves.","Joshua Shanker","And that will bounce around quarter-to-quarter, I guess, as well?","Anant Bhalla","Well, this quarter, we moved assets out of Corporate & Other into Life and Annuities. So from here onwards, it should be around the level that it was in this quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Scott","I had a follow-up question on CTE levels. And I guess, the question is just around the tax rate that's being used in the calculation. Is it 21% or 35%? And am I right that it's after-tax calculation? And then just any kind of color you can provide around how we should think about that sensitivity if the tax rate was changed.","Anant Bhalla","Alex, it Anant. So it's 35%. For it to change, it will have to go through the NAIC process to change. And when we talk about VA reform, we've already factored in the fact of this change would - may happen. And so we'll give you guys a view on it later. It's a couple of hundred million dollars if you wanted 21%, but we believe it's manageable along what we said about VA reform overall.","Alex Scott","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the NII yield, when I look at, I guess, it was around 20 basis point increase quarter-over-quarter, and I think around half of that was alternatives. Was it the - some of the repositioning that drove the other 10 basis points? And I guess, any color on how much more we could expect that to go up over the next few quarters?","John Rosenthal","It's John. There were a number of things, including a bit of the repositioning. The portfolio was a little bigger, some benefits from our floating rate assets as your rates rose. I would say the repositioning and the floating rate benefits and the asset growth, which are smaller compared to variable income, will continue over the next quarters.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.","Thomas Gallagher","Eric, just going back to the comments you made on the capital buffer of $3 billion and why that's not necessarily the end-all and be-all, but it's more about visibility on VA reform. If that's the case, once you do get clarity at some point this year, unless there's a pretty adverse development versus what you're thinking now, why wouldn't a 2019 capital return make more sense for you? Is it because of the distributable free cash flow isn't strong enough yet? Or is 2019 a possibility here?","Eric Steigerwalt","Well, I'd never want to front-run my board. But if we're just being theoretical, why would you take it off the table? Your logic there seems sound. I really need to know where VA capital reform comes out. I imagine all of you think that's pretty prudent, but we want to return capital. We really do. That is creating value, and we want to do value-creating things. We've tried to be transparent with you as to where we are now. You had to have a base case. And so in the base case, it begins in 2020. But you read my comments correctly. I don't want to be completely tied to this $3 billion. I know over time that that's been out there. But it - in my mind, it's kind of been tied to the timing of VA capital reform. They're both going to sort of occur if markets continue here, you would imagine in the not-too-distant future. I'll also add, if you go back to the Form 10, we said, look, a $2 billion to $3 billion buffer would make us comfortable. So at this point, it really is VA capital reform. And as Anant said, we are participating in that. It's very constructive, and I'm very hopeful. So there's my comment.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. And I guess, my other question related to that is I know when the Form 10 first came out, the - or, I guess, in your net road show, you were talking about it, I think it was 50% to 70% distributable free cash flow as a percent of GAAP earnings. Is that still a decent way to think about if and when the capital return does start, the kind of annual sizing of how much you might want to do? Or - because I presume it's going to be more tied to what you think you're generating annually? Or might it be some drawdown of excess if you do determine there's excess at that point? And any help you can give on the way you'd be thinking about the size when you do get to that point?","Eric Steigerwalt","I love you, Tom. Look, let me just say something here in addition to sort of I think the thrust of your question. Look, we're very pleased. You heard my opening remarks. They were not throwaway comments. This was a clean quarter for us. Most of the drivers are going in the right direction. I don't think the concept of free cash flow there is going to be a restraint on us. But for now, I'm just going to hold off on taking now the second leap towards, well, if you are thinking of returning capital, how much will it be? But I think the operative line that I said is it's not going to be constraint for us. Anant, you want to add anything?","Anant Bhalla","Well, the only thing I'll add is we want you guys to think about it in dollar terms so you can see the dollar impact. And then as you see the earnings power emerge as we execute, you can then do the ratio after that.","Eric Steigerwalt","Does that make sense, Tom?","Thomas Gallagher","Yes, that does, that does. And then just one final question. Anant, on what you all are, I guess, most focused on with VA reform, I think the VM20 interest rate assumption is the obvious thing that may create a bit of pressure for you. Is there - is that right? And is there any other issues or areas of focus regarding VA reform that you would direct us to where there's some uncertainty?","Anant Bhalla","Yes. So you've got it on the VM20 side. We feel very good about actually managing through all the moving parts, right? There were 28 parts, which we can summarize into the scenarios and the VM20. And that would probably be lower levels of interest rates for mean reversion. But the timing of when you get them makes a difference. The single thing that we're most focus on is getting the standard scenario reformed. The standard scenario, which drives tax surplus is punitive to GMIB companies versus GMWB companies. It's not harmonized across the industry. So if you ask me what we think about the most is we want to make sure, and the regulators are all pushing for this, the standard scenario to be harmonized. And then we can focus on a CTE high-type measure like CTE95 and start to distribute capital.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Randy Binner with B. Riley.","Randolph Binner","Just a couple on the segments. So on Annuities, the negative flow, the sales are good. This is an - kind of looking at variable and fixed annuity - I'm sorry, variable and indexed annuities. But the flows continue to be significantly negative, and I think I've asked this question in the past. And I don't believe you've given an expectation of positive flows. But, I guess, when do we see kind of a material turn and when they stop being this materially negative?","Eric Steigerwalt","I'll start. Myles, you might want to jump in here. Look, we've been saying this range here of $1.5 billion to $2-ish billion for a while. As sales increase and frankly, as that book continues to mature, I think the lapses will stabilize, and we expect sales growth here. You heard Myles' comment on a previous question. We have a lot of momentum here. We had a lot of momentum coming into 2018. We've got a lot of momentum as we head into the second quarter here, new distribution channels, fabulous partners that we already have that are selling more of our products. And by the way, it's not just Shield. It's the new VA product as well. So look, with full transparency though, it's still going to take a while. You got to remember, and I think most of you will remember, these lapses are coming off business that was put on the books, not solely, but in '10, '11 and '12 if you remember back. And that was a lot of business. I mean, in 2012, it was $28 billion of deposits. So when you're more in the $5-ish billion range of sales, you can see that math here. Now again, as lapse rates stabilize and as we grow sales, which we will do, it's going to start heading towards zero. But you cannot measure it in quarters. It - that math doesn't work. I think you all know that. So it's going to take a couple of years. That's just the way it is.","Randolph Binner","That's helpful. And then on the Life segment, the earnings pattern there has been kind of up and down. And can you characterize whether or not this is - if you look at the adjusted earnings in the Life segment this quarter, is this an - it's probably better than a normal quarter, but what - is this within the realm of possibilities that we can plan on there? Or would that number be lower on a quarterly basis for the Life segment?","Anant Bhalla","It's Anant. So Life earnings ex notables is $50 million ex notables, right? And almost half of that is from the investment income from the realignment of the portfolio. So we moved a lot of assets into the segment. So it's got its stat reserves and capital. Now everything in the Life segment went very well this quarter. Underwriting was good, expenses were lower, taxes were lower. And then I think of underwriting both the severity was low and reserve development patterns were good. So if everything goes in the right direction, you get a quarter like this.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up question from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Scott","I just had a quick one on the captive. In the SQL, when I think about the reserves that have been ceded there, could you just discuss the amount of hard assets and the amount of reinsurance that's been done in that entity relative to the amount of stat reserves that have been ceded and, I guess, also just the amount of GAAP reserves that have been ceded. I'm just trying to understand how much hard capital is there and sort of how conservatively capitalized that that's been done.","Anant Bhalla","Thanks, Alex. It's Anant. In the 10-K, we outlined around $16.9 billion of total target assets for the ULSG book and around 2\/3 of that is in the captive. Those are with hard assets, with invested assets.","Alex Scott","Okay. And then if I think about how much third-party reinsurance was used down there, would I just look at sort of the difference between the net and gross reserves in your supplement? I guess, that's on a GAAP basis. But is there any way to think about that piece of it?","Anant Bhalla","The total stat reserve is around $19 billion, a little north of that. So the difference between - there's around $4 billion of what people call noneconomic reserves, which are funded with third-party assets.","Operator","And that does conclude today's Q&A session, and I'd like to return the call to Mr. David Rosenbaum for any closing remarks.","David Rosenbaum","Thank you, Operator.

My name is Carmen and I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the presentation over to David Rosenbaum, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Rosenbaum, you may proceed.","David Rosenbaum","Good morning and thank you for joining Brighthouse Financial\u2019s third quarter 2018 earnings call. Our earnings release, presentation, and financial supplement were released last night and can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at brighthousefinancial.com. We encourage you to review all of these materials, and we will refer to the slide presentation in our prepared remarks.","Today, you will hear from Eric Steigerwalt, our President and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Anant Bhalla, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer period. Also, here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of senior management.","Our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Brighthouse Financial\u2019s actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in Brighthouse Financial\u2019s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Information discussed on today\u2019s call speaks only as of today, November 6, 2018. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed on today\u2019s call.","During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures that are not based on Generally","Accepted Accounting Principles, also known as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures on a historical basis to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related definitions may be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website, in our earnings release, slide presentation or financial supplement. And finally, references to statutory results are preliminary due to the timing of the filing of the statutory statement.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Steigerwalt.","Eric Steigerwalt","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone.","I\u2019m very pleased with our results from the third quarter of 2018, including our strong adjusted earnings performance and outstanding quarter-over-quarter sales growth. I also feel very good about our progress relative to our plans.","In August, our Board of Directors approved a $200 million stock repurchase program, our first as an independent publicly traded company, and significantly ahead of our base case scenario. I\u2019m pleased to announce, we repurchased approximately 982,000 shares in the third quarter and an additional 523,000 shares in October or approximately $64 million of our stock cumulatively. As of the end of October, we have utilized approximately 32% of the authorization.","I\u2019m going to focus the remainder of my comments today around the progress we have made with respect to our top priorities for 2018. As a reminder, the top priorities are: First, we are focused on exiting our transition service agreements or TSAs with MetLife. Exiting TSA supports our goal of reducing our overall cost structure as a standalone company. Second, we are enhancing our distribution platform and network, and developing new products that respond to the evolving needs of our advisors and the clients that they serve. And third, we are actively managing through NAIC variable annuity capital reform and growing our earnings power.","Let\u2019s begin with the TSAs. Exiting TSAs with MetLife and replacing them with more cost effective solutions is essential to executing on our strategy. We began the year with 147 TSAs remaining, and we expect to end the year with approximately 85, demonstrating significant progress towards solidifying the Brighthouse operating platform.","Second, product and distribution. I am very pleased with our annuity sales results in the third quarter of 2018. Annuity sales of over $1.5 billion were up 43% quarter-over-quarter, our highest level of sales since we became a public company, driven by strong sales of our Shield product and our fixed indexed annuity. Sales of Shield annuities were $867 million in the quarter, up 33% quarter-over-quarter. The growth in annuity sales reflects the strength of our distribution relationships and the ongoing momentum from our branding initiatives. We are continuing to see excitement from our long-standing distribution partners, but we are also continuing to see inbound interest from distributors with whom we do not currently have a relationship. And we\u2019re working with all partners, both current and prospective to continue to make our distribution network as broad as possible, as we help consumers in the United States achieve financial security.","In September, we broadened our annuity product offering with the launch of two new fixed annuity products. As interest rates rise, demand for fixed annuities increases, making this an important enhancement to our product portfolio. As part of the development of these products, we entered into a reinsurance agreement with the theme to launch products that are very competitive in the market. The early feedback from our distribution partners has been very positive.","Turning to life insurance. As we have discussed in the past, life insurance is an important market for us to be in. And we are following a strategy that we believe will help us reestablish a competitive foothold in this space. We have made good progress with the development of our forthcoming life product and are pleased that it has been approved in 46 states so far. We are still targeting a launch of this product by the end of this year.","Turning to our third quarter results. Our key financial highlights for the third quarter are summarized on slide three of our earnings presentation. Adjusted earnings were strong in the quarter and improved from the second quarter. As we highlighted last quarter, the key drivers to improve performance in the second half of the year are equity market returns, investment results, lower expenses, and lower severity in universal life with secondary guarantees. All of these drivers performed in line with or better than our expectations in the third quarter.","Our corporate expenses were $242 million in the quarter, down $46 million sequentially and consistent with our expectations. Corporate expenses in the first 12 months post-separation were approximately $1.05 billion, and we still expect to reduce these expenses by $150 million by the end of 2020. We are also making necessarily investments in our technology infrastructure and in our businesses. We refer to these investments as establishment costs. In the third quarter, establishment costs were approximately $87 million pretax.","Finally, we incorporated the new variable annuity capital reform framework and lower tax rate of 21% in our calculation of CTE95 and CTE98 during the quarter. Variable annuity assets were more than $600 million, above the new CTE98 calculation, as of the end of the third quarter. The result is in line with our expectations, given favorable markets in the third quarter. We anticipate providing our variable annuity capital level relative to CTE98 on a qualitative basis, until we implement the new framework into statutory reporting, which we hope to do in 2019. At that point, we will likely transition to a risk-based capital disclosure.","To wrap up, we are very pleased with the results in the quarter and the continued execution of our strategy. Our sales in annuities were very strong and our operational performance in the quarter was very good, highlighted by improved adjusted earnings.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Anant to discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail. Anant? ","Anant Bhalla","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone.","Let me start with the third quarter results and provide some perspectives on the key underlying themes, beginning on slide four.","Adjusted earnings excluding the impact from notable items were $314 million in the quarter compared to adjusted earnings on the same basis of $197 million in the second quarter of 2018 and $294 million in the third quarter of 2017. The annuity segment continues to perform well and results in the life segment were strong.","There were three notable items in the quarter, lowering adjusted earnings by $44 million after tax or $0.37 per share. The notable items included establishment costs of $69 million after tax, a $121 million after tax net unfavorable impact from the recapture of reinsurance treaties, almost entirely impacting the run-off segment, and a $146 million after tax net favorable impact to adjusted earnings from our 2018 annual actuarial review, which is done each year in the third quarter. The total impact to net income from the annual actuarial review was an unfavorable $32 million after tax.","Let me provide some additional color on our annual actuarial review. Over the last couple of years, including 2017 as our first year performing the review as a standalone company, our actuarial reviews have focused on two themes: First, harmonizing the assumptions between GAAP and statutory accounting; and second, updating our actuarial practices. This involved being informed by the richest possible set of data available in the market on client behavior, including the quantitative impact study or QIS, conducted as part of the NAIC\u2019s variable annuity reserve and capital reform initiative.","These efforts resulted in Brighthouse being well-positioned with what we believe to be prudent, conservative behavior assumptions. These assumptions include annuitization election rates of 2% for post-retirement age, GMIB contract holders, and 1.5% lapse rate for all deep in the money living benefits.","This year\u2019s annual actuarial review focused on three primary outcomes: First, reflecting the new NAIC rules for variable annuity reserve and capital in our management metrics of CTE95 and CTE98, resulting in alignment with the new framework. This includes lowering the long-term mean reversion assumption for the 10-year interest rate to 3.25%. Second, reflecting the new 21% tax rate, consistent with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, resulting in a higher statutory total assets requirement. And third, performing the regular annual review models and assumptions, thereby incorporating one more year of experience on all of our businesses.","Now, I\u2019d like to provide some perspective on four themes related to our adjusted earnings this quarter. The first theme is the investment portfolio. Net investment income was higher sequentially, primarily driven by an increase in alternative investment income, the investment portfolio repositioning that we started in the first quarter and growth in assets. Alternative investment income was approximately $19 million after tax or $0.16 per share higher than the four-quarter historical average for 2017 as seen on slide five. Through the third quarter, we have repositioned approximately $4.4 billion of treasuries into higher yielding spread assets.","The second theme is the impact of strong markets on earnings. Separate account returns were approximately 3% in the quarter and above our base case assumptions by approximately 1.4 percentage points. This market outperformance relative to the base case resulted in higher fee revenues, lower reserves and lower DAC amortization, adding up to a favorable impact to adjusted earnings of approximately $15 million after tax or $0.13 per share as seen on slide five.","Let me also shed some more light on the underlying fund mix in our separate accounts, which drives the separate account return. Approximately one-third of our funds are bond like in each, while the remaining two-thirds out across equity indices including large cap such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ, mid cap such as the Russell 2000, and international funds such as the MSCI EAFE. Hence, our separate account return of 3% in the third quarter is consistent with this type of fund mix.","The third theme for the quarter that I would like to discuss is expenses. Corporate expenses were $242 million in the quarter, down approximately $46 million pre-tax sequentially, consistent with our expectation. On an after-tax per share basis, that translates to a $0.30 per share sequential impact.","The final theme for the quarter is life insurance claims. Third quarter results improved from the second quarter, driven by both, lower frequency and lower severity of claims, and in aggregate were in line with our expectation. ","Now, turning to adjusted earnings at the segment level, which excludes the previously mentioned notable items. Adjusted earnings in the annuity segment were $247 million in the quarter. Sequentially, results benefited from higher net investment income, lower expenses and favorable taxes. Adjusted earnings in the life segment were $50 million in the quarter, sequentially, results benefited from lower expenses. Adjusted earnings in the runoff segment were $35 million in the quarter. Sequentially, claims and expenses were lower and net investment income was higher.","As we\u2019ve mentioned previously, claim results can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We still expect the run-rate of adjusted earnings in this segment to be in the $15 million area per quarter with possible variation quarter-to-quarter. Corporate and other had an adjusted loss of $18 million. Sequentially, expenses were lower and taxes were favorable.","In closing, let me provide an update on our balance sheet position and our variable annuity hedging as of September 30th. First, we feel very good about our capitalization levels, including a stock repurchase program in place supported by excess cash at the holding company. Variable annuity assets were in excess of CTE98 by more than $600 million, reflecting the impact of both the new variable annuity capital reform and the lower 21% tax rate.","Going forward, as we manage variable annuity assets at or above a CTE98 level in normal markets, in 2019, we will likely transition to talking about capitalization in the context of a total company RBC ratio basis, which will include CTE98 for variable annuities in that calculation. Second, our hedging program is working and delivering results in line with our expectation for the market movements in the quarter. Third, statutory total adjusted capital was $6 billion or in line with the prior quarter. This reflects the existing variable annuity reserve requirements which we expect to sunset with the potential early adoption of the NAIC capital reform for statutory reporting by year-end 2019. Fourth, holding company liquid assets were approximately $600 million, primarily reflecting our issuance of junior subordinated notes in September as capital contribution to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company from the issuance of proceeds in addition to share repurchases in the quarter. We believe the capital contribution positions us well to begin reducing hedge costs further next year. And finally, financial leverage was approximately 23.5%.","With that, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question, so, in terms of as we think about investment income going forward from here, you guys highlighted the repositioning of the investment portfolio. Is this quarter kind of a good run-rate to think about going forward or any other onetimers other than the stronger alternative investment income you guys pointed to?","John Rosenthal","Hi. This is John Rosenthal. As Anant pointed out, this quarter benefitted from higher alts, higher average asset growth and repositioning. Alt was predominantly the key contributor to the increase. I think going forward, as you know, alternative income very difficult to predict quarter-to-quarter. I think having said that, we wouldn\u2019t expect alternatives in Q4 to reach the elevated levels that they reached in Q3. However, net investment income will continue to benefit from portfolio repositioning, higher asset growth and investing at higher interest rates.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then, you guys -- the ROE picked up and results were stronger in the quarter. Is the assumption that you guys still expect full-year earnings to come in, in line with that previous $8.50 to $9 per share range?","Eric Steigerwalt","Good morning, Elyse. It\u2019s Eric Steigerwalt. So, let me answer that question. And then, I\u2019m going to actually add a little maybe longer term strategic context for everybody. First, it\u2019s not bad often that we have equity markets like October. But, as long as markets do reasonably well for the rest of the year, I think that range is still appropriate. That\u2019s why we broke out the excess returns in the presentation for the third quarter, so that you can get a sense of how, slightly abnormal markets affect us. Now, obviously, it will take a pretty good market to be at the top of the range.","More importantly, on our December investor call, we will talk about like a longer term base case earnings growth percentage. Okay? And we expect that to be in the higher range than our current mid to high single digits. So, we\u2019ll talk about that in early December. And we\u2019re going to lay out our expense plans, our investment portfolio repositioning and our product strategy, so that you\u2019ll see the drivers of that EPS growth.","I might as well just add because I know the question is coming here. With respect to assets above CTE98, post the third quarter, so post October, roughly where we stand today, we believe we\u2019re still well in excess, despite the October equity market performance. However, again, it might be valuable to make a few strategic comments. As Anant said, and as we said before, actually, in the near future, in 2019, we intend to begin operating within a range of RBC levels. And I\u2019m looking forward to discussing that with you, as soon as we can. As I\u2019ve said before, we intend to be a consistent returner of capital across market cycles. And all of our efforts are centered around being able to adopt VA capital form in 2019 to that end. So, I hope I answered your actual question. But, I thought that that additional strategic context might help everybody.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. One last question. Corporate expenses lower than what was implied by your run rate in the quarter. Is that -- should we assume that they will continue to go down from this quarter\u2019s level?","Eric Steigerwalt","Anant and I are battling as to who gets to go here. So, I\u2019ll start and you can jump in, Anant. Look, again, strategically, they absolutely are going to go down. We are going to hit that $150 million goal period. Obviously, there\u2019s quarterly fluctuations. Generally, a lot of companies have higher expenses in the fourth quarter. But, we\u2019re very focused on this. And it\u2019s a little bit different for us and that we\u2019re on a journey over time here to lower expenses year after year after year. So, the third quarter is a reasonable run rate. It could fluctuate a little bit around that, but you\u2019re certainly not going to see dramatically higher expenses in the fourth quarter.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Nadel with UBS. Your line is open.","John Nadel","Hey, good morning. So, Eric, you sort of touched on the October market decline. And my question was going to be, how much volatility you expect that we could see in that capital level above CTE98 as you think about some of the drivers including the equity market performance?","Eric Steigerwalt","Well, John, as you know, the markets are going to move around. We all know that. Our goal is to be in a position both with managing the CTE98, sort of in any regular market environment and then having our CTE95 floor in more severe markets that little fluctuations are not going to stop. I mean, I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re headed towards capital return. And what happened in October will have zero effect on our share repurchases. We will continue to repurchase stock. I can follow up, if you want to direct us further.","John Nadel","Yes. I\u2019ll follow up offline to get maybe a little bit deeper into the weeds. But, I guess, that\u2019s what I\u2019m sort of trying to understand. You guys have laid out at the spin-off that over time you would take on more risk, effectively your own deductible, if you will. And just trying to understand how much that whole theme may have changed as a result of the VA capital reform.","Eric Steigerwalt","Yes. I\u2019ll add a little. Anant, you can jump in there. Look, we\u2019ve put a couple of hundred million down into the operating company. That positions us even better with respect to that deductible going forward. So, there is sort of two pieces to that, keep in mind. But secondarily, over time, I\u2019ve said and I will continue to say, the goal is to be a consistent returner. So, I sort of think of like we\u2019re transforming the Company. We\u2019ve come a long way in the last couple of years. And as we continue to execute on this strategy, the goal is to be more consistent with respect to returning capital. And again, it seems to be the overall notion of your question.","John Nadel","Yes, understood. And then, just maybe two quick ones, one for John and one for Anant. John, could you just tell you us what the private equity annualized return was in the quarter? And then, Anant, if we look at the year-to-date effective tax rate on an operating basis, it looks like it\u2019s about mid-13% range. That\u2019s definitely below your high-teens expectations. I\u2019m just wondering whether this is more reflective of the level we should expect going forward, or is this just a matter of timing and we should expect the high teens rates as we look out to 2019 and beyond?","John Rosenthal","I\u2019ll take these. It\u2019s John. The actual return, the absolute return for the quarter was 4%. So, the annualized was about 16%, which is higher than we would normally expect, John.","John Nadel","Yes. Thanks. ","Anant Bhalla","Hi. It\u2019s Anant. On the tax rate, you\u2019re right. We have came in on the lower end of our range. We actually expect to be at that lower end of the range for the rest of the year. But, as earnings go up, we will be at the upper end of the range.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","Hi. Thanks good morning. I assume you\u2019ll give us updated variable annuity cash flow spend here, in the 10-K again this year. I was hoping to get some perspective on I guess how meaningful do those change they get impacted by the new NAIC VA reform. And then, related to that, I guess, you\u2019ll -- I believe you said, you\u2019ll reflect the 3.25% long-term tenure going forward as well?","Anant Bhalla","Hi, Ryan. Good morning. The answer to your second question is yes, the 3.25% long-term 10-year treasury is already reflected in our numbers with our annual actuarial review this year. So, when we say we\u2019re CTE98, plus more than $600 million, that\u2019s already factored in.","To your first question on sensitivities, we will update them as we update our 10-K. But, let me take a step back, adding on to the earlier answer and how we think about it. Our hedging strategy is not changed. We\u2019re doing exactly what we laid out, diligently executing it and protecting the floor level while managing capital within RBC range with CTE98 going into that calculation, which means we will grow our, what we colloquially call, a deductible or asset -- a shock absorber from $1 billion up to $1.5 billion and then up from there to $2 billion. We\u2019re on path to doing that. I\u2019ll take any follow-on. But I thought, that would be helpful context.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks. And separate question, actually. In terms of the legacy SGL, do you see an opportunity to free-up any reserves to either reinsurance transaction or renegotiating captive [ph] with regulators?","Eric Steigerwalt","It\u2019s a little hard to hear you, Ryan. But I think your question was freeing up capital from the ULSG block. Was that what you said?","Ryan Krueger","Yes, right. And I guess, either through reinsurance or renegotiating the terms of the captive [ph] with the regulators. ","Eric Steigerwalt","Okay. So, yes, there\u2019s certainly a possibility. It\u2019ll happen over time. Because it needs regulatory approvals, et cetera. So, again, like we\u2019ve said many times, there could be potential opportunities. It\u2019s just one of the arrows in the quiver. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to happen tomorrow. But over time, yes, there could be some capital potentially freed up with respect to the ULSG block.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. It sounds from your comments that you feel pretty confident about being able to early adopting new NAIC for market in 2019. If you can, would this enable you to potentially contemplate an extraordinary dividend from BLICin 2019?","Anant Bhalla","Erik, it\u2019s Anant. We can do an extraordinary dividend even without early adopting it. But yes, the short answer is yes, and we feel very good about that.","Erik Bass","Okay. And then, do you have any perspective on -- realizing it\u2019s early on the new GAAP accounting standards that will come into effect and the potential implications for Brighthouse?","Anant Bhalla","It is pretty early to talk about that. It\u2019s an effective date of 2021. What I would say, it does not impact us stack results. We don\u2019t expect it to impact our plans for capital return. We as a management team have demonstrated with VA stack reform that we can successfully navigate through regulatory and accounting changes. And finally, we believe we\u2019re very well-positioned with the leverage ratio that\u2019s in the low to mid-20s, low relative to rating agency expectations for a single year financial strength rating. So, we feel good about our ability to navigate things over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman","Hey. Good morning. With regard to the 600-plus-million in excess of CTE98 versus what was quoted as 500-plus last quarter. What if the market were locked in today where it is now, down, since the quarter started? Would you be back at the 500-plus, where do you think you would be?","Eric Steigerwalt","Andrew, like I said before, I think on the first question, and I\u2019m going to try not to get into this, like on a weekly basis. But, we would still be well in excess.","Andrew Kligerman","Okay. I\u2019ll leave it at that. And then, with regard to the portfolio repositioning, how much more do you have to go? And what types of securities, do you want to do with the remainder of this week, repositioning?","John Rosenthal","Andrew, hi, it\u2019s John. As Anant said, through the end of Q3, we\u2019ve rotated at about -- out of about $4.4 billion of treasuries. We\u2019re continuing to rotate out of treasuries into spread assets. That\u2019s the predominant portion of our repositioning. And we will provide more details about the size of the program, its timing, and the ultimate income pickup during our call next month.","Andrew Kligerman","I mean, is it more than $1 billion? I mean, what kind of spread assets are you looking at?","John Rosenthal","Remaining more than $1 billion is that what you\u2019re asking?","Andrew Kligerman","More to go in terms of repositioning, I mean\u2026","John Rosenthal","There is more to go, and we\u2019ll talk about exactly how much or relatively how much next month. And we\u2019re investing in our really high-quality well-diversified normal asset mix. So, nothing unusual on the reinvestment side.","Andrew Kligerman","Okay. And Eric, just one last one. You talked last quarter about being measured and prudent in terms of the buyback. And certainly, 40-plus, that was sort of a quarter of your -- or close to a quarter of your 200. When you did that 300- plus-million-dollar debt offering, so I thought you might accelerate that. Is there a chance you might want to accelerate the buyback as we move forward?","Eric Steigerwalt","So, are you talking about the current buyback authorization, Andrew that\u2026","Andrew Kligerman","Correct.","Eric Steigerwalt","Okay. Look, it\u2019s worked pretty well for us during the period that we\u2019ve purchased. The stock has been up and down, and we\u2019ve got pretty nice dollar cost averaging there. I would expect it to be just like we\u2019re doing now, a measured but consistent repurchase plan.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Josh Shanker","Good morning, everyone. Curious if internally you have any goals around a timeline for turning to net positive flows in annuities. And if we were to think about losing $5 billion a year net flows of annuities that probably have higher capital charges given the older vintages than the ones that you\u2019re writing today, is that a capital and ROE positive event, losing those assets?","Conor Murphy","Yes. Hi. It\u2019s Conor. Let me start, I\u2019m sure Eric may want to join in as well. So, look, as we\u2019ve discussed previously, we have a large book to begin with. Clearly we had a good quarter in regard to flows. And we\u2019re very pleased with the business that we\u2019re putting on both in terms of the quality of the business and the return on that business. And as you know and as you acknowledged, much of what comes off is less profitable. So, this isn\u2019t preventing us from expanding our profitable growth goals here.","Josh Shanker","Is it positive to move to those flows, is that actually beneficial to you over time?","Conor Murphy","Much -- it\u2019s mix, much of it is. Now remember, some of the flows is just the normal course of what\u2019s happening at annuitization, some of it is surrenders. And a reasonable amount of those surrenders are positive to us because they\u2019re surrenders that are in the money, some of it is significantly in the money. So, that helps us from a profitability and capital perspective.","Eric Steigerwalt","Yes. It\u2019s Eric. I would add to that. Look, I mean, we don\u2019t pray each day for lapses. Okay? Because over time it will affect your earnings growth. But, the comment that I made at the beginning of this Q&A period, you\u2019re going to see pretty good EPS growth power out of Brighthouse in the December call, and that factors in the net flows, right, for years here. Having said that, there are some lapses that we prefer not to lose, but there are a meaningful amount that that qualify for what you said, Josh, at the beginning of your question, that in the end you\u2019d have to say are sort of ROA or capital positive to us. So, we\u2019re in a little different position maybe than some other companies here. So, I hope that was -- I\u2019m trying -- we\u2019re trying to give you the balanced answer. But, the answer to your original question is, yes.","Josh Shanker","And is there an internal target for the idea of Brighthouse returning to a net positive flow company?","Eric Steigerwalt","I don\u2019t have a target. Look, I\u2019ve said this before. It\u2019s going to take a number of years, okay, notwithstanding the fact that as we just discussed, some of these lapses are actually positive for the Company. But, it\u2019s going to take a while. So, I\u2019m not ready to give out a target yet because it would just sort of be a quarterly while you\u2019re still a ways away from it. But, overall, in December, you\u2019re going to see that despite the level of negative net flows, we\u2019ve got some real EPS growth power here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Barnidge with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","John Barnidge","Thank you. I guess, it\u2019s a difficult thing to quantify but some other companies did provide it last week. So, maybe I\u2019ll ask the question this way. If last night was the quarter close, can you quantify how much of a headwind on an EPS basis the market would be to guidance?","Anant Bhalla","Hey, John, it\u2019s Anant. We did give you the sensitivity which was like, if you translate that, it\u2019d be like $0.09 for 1 percentage point, a separate account return. So, I would just point you to that.","John Barnidge","Okay. Thanks. And then, how much of a growth in the increasing fixed sales do you find benefiting from the market volatility versus maybe higher rates and better distribution? Thank you for your answers.","Myles Lambert","Yes. This is Myles speaking. So, if you take a look at sequentially, most of our growth has come from our Shield product as well as our FIA product that we distribute to mass mutual. If you look at the industry as a whole, in light of some volatility you are seeing, fixed products up. And as we mentioned earlier on the call, we just introduced two new fixed deferred products in September that we\u2019re optimistic we\u2019re going to be able to gain some sales traction with. So, we like the fixed base, we\u2019re applying it on the fixed base, and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on the fixed base moving forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Good morning. So for Anant on the CTE98, moving from 500-plus to 600-plus, over the course of the call, you talked about several pieces, changing the interest rate assumption, tax reform, VA capital reform, and then a capital contribution. Can you help us think through sort of sizing those pieces as we think about a potential lock from 2Q to 3Q?","Anant Bhalla","Good morning, Suneet. Happy to do so. So, let\u2019s start with, we expected to be at CTE98 post VA reform, both the capital reform and the tax rate change, and making a capital contribution. We contributed $200 million down into the life company to that effect. We ended up with the better outcome with assets over $600 million above CTE98 due to strong business results. These were driven by two real factors. Approximately two thirds of that came from market upside in the hedging program. So, our hedging program is working very well. Frankly, over the last five quarters, we\u2019ve had more than a $1 billion of market upside by putting a $1 billion of assets as a deductible. So, that\u2019s really great results, a lot of that coming through this quarter as well.","And the other third of the growth came from statutory net income, which if you look at page 21 of the supplement, you\u2019ll see we had good core stack returns and then market upside because of the hedging program. I can pause and take any follow-on you have on it.","Suneet Kamath","And what was the impact of tax reform just on that CTE98 buffer?","Anant Bhalla","Tax reform was actually a bigger driver, if you think about the assets above CTE98. It was actually closer to like more than half.","Suneet Kamath","Sorry. More than half of what?","Anant Bhalla","More than half of the impact of implementing VA reform.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Maybe I\u2019ll follow-up afterwards. And then, I think you had said that you\u2019ve maintained your lapse rate assumption at 1.5%. And I think there is some commentary around that being consistent with the study. But, as I think about other companies, I think their lapse rate assumptions are less than 1%. But, maybe if you could comment there, but also if you were to reduce the lapse rate to 1%, any sense of what the sensitivity would be in terms of required VA assets?","Anant Bhalla","Sure. So, you\u2019re right. As I said in my prepared comments, we\u2019ve looked at not just one study, we\u2019ve looked at every study that\u2019s out there and participated in the QIS as part of NAIC reform. We feel really good about our assumption changes on lapse, elective annuitizations and all of those that we made. We hope everybody is actually feeling as good as we\u2019re feeling about it, given the changes we\u2019ve made. So, I don\u2019t see us, given what our data is, and our experience is, as Conor and others mentioned, we have in the money policies lapsing, I don\u2019t see how we have to go lower than 1.5%.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. But, no sensitivity, if you did?","Anant Bhalla","It\u2019s sort of a hypothetical that at this point in time doesn\u2019t make intuitive sense because I don\u2019t see how the data would have a go there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Your line is open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. The first question is, you\u2019ve been talking about how you\u2019re going to manage to a total RBC standard by the end of 2019, that\u2019s the goal. Right now, I guess all we\u2019ve talked about is VA CTE. What would a total RBC standard entail in terms of -- and the reason I\u2019m asking is obviously you have other businesses, other assets outside of VA. Would everything else, if you kind of categorize that separately, give you significant access over the 400% RBC, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to be managing to, or how should we think about that?","Eric Steigerwalt","Let me start, and Anant you can jump in. Hey, Tom, it\u2019s Eric. We\u2019re going through that with our Board now. So, we\u2019re not going to get there until we adopt VA capital reform. But as you said, and as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re hopefully going to do that for 2019. So, we\u2019ve got to come up with a range here of where we\u2019re going to manage the company with respect to RBC. And we\u2019re working that through as we speak, literally. As you very well know, the VA capital reform makes RBC robust, right. So, now, you can sort of use that as a global metric for the whole company. So, the idea is that we get to some sort of range that we will certainly make public where we want to manage this. And that could give you some sense of if there\u2019s any dividendable excess capital at the operating companies. And then, obviously, you\u2019d take a look at what we\u2019ve got at the holding company. And like many other companies, we hope to be able to give you a sense over time here of what we think are approximate excess capital position might be. Anant, do you want to add anything?","Anant Bhalla","I think you\u2019ve covered it. But Tom, if you have any follow-ups, we\u2019re happy to take it.","Tom Gallagher","Sure. So, yes, I guess, just one follow-up to that. So, Eric or Anant, at this point, would you say, everything that\u2019s kind of measured outside of VA, is it -- does it look like it would be above, would there be access or it\u2019s not clear at this point? Just higher level directional?","Anant Bhalla","Yes, Tom, it\u2019s Anant. We think of the company to be capitalized in the OpCos at like single A rating levels, so you should think of sort of RBC levels relative to that. And then, going forward, as Eric mentioned, we\u2019ll be at 98, 98-plus, so we\u2019ll be at like 400, 400-plus and we need to come back to that and what that actual target is next year.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And then, my other question is just on -- Anant, I know you said, you mentioned, you\u2019re going to be shifting to lower hedging costs in 2019 is the plan. Would that primarily be focused on lower use of options? Because I think right now you\u2019re spending around $800 million a year on option premium. Is that the main area or would it be much more -- much broader in terms of how you would change the hedge program?","Anant Bhalla","We would -- yes, we would grow the assets that act as a shock absorber from $1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2019. We\u2019re actually already working on that. And what it allows us to do is strike things to be a little more out of the money. So, you still use an options based program predominantly, but you go little out of the money, and you reap the benefits of that. And I\u2019d sort of rephrase. I mean, the fact that we\u2019ve had this option-based strategy has allowed us to actually have the program allow us contribute $1 billion of upside in the last five quarters. That\u2019s really meaningful and we\u2019ll look to grow that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Most of my questions were answered. But I\u2019m not sure if you mentioned what the impact of VA capital reform was on your assets above CTE98. How did that affect you, can you quantify?","Anant Bhalla","Good morning, Jimmy. Sure. So, if the question is what was the impact of VA reform on our assets above CTE95, tax reform was a big driver of it. The combined impact of both of those was about $1 billion, driven majority by tax reform and then some amount by really the capital market changes, really nothing material, other than those two to really call out. It\u2019s 3.25% and the biggest drop was coming from 21%. Net of that, we would have still ended up at CTE98. And we\u2019re at 98 plus more than $600 million because of the really strong business results with the two factors I gave in my answer to Suneet earlier.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then, on the Shield product, obviously you\u2019ve seen pretty strong sales over the last several quarters. Are you seeing any impact on the business or are your expectations changing as competitors are coming out with some other products, like Lincoln has a buffer annuity, many those are -- there are few other companies that are thinking about coming out of something similar?","Myles Lambert","Hi. It\u2019s Myles again. No, we feel very confident about our current Shield product. Our advisors love the competitiveness of the product and its simple nature. We\u2019re continuing to bring on new distributors, selling the products, further broadening distribution. And as is always, we\u2019ll monitor the competitive landscape and will make changes if appropriate. But we feel really good about our market position right now.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then, just lastly on buybacks, I think Eric alluded to this. But, is this safe to assume that despite the market sort of volatility that we\u2019ve seen recently that you\u2019re going to keep buying back stock in the near term?","Eric Steigerwalt","Jimmy, it is very safe to assume that.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Scott","First question was just on the GAAP changes through the actuarial review for variable annuities. I think you mentioned the election rate assumption is 2% now. Could you give us a feel for how that changed? I mean, that sounds kind of low. But, I know annuitizations have been or elections of annuitizations have been pretty low. Just wondering like how much data you have on that and how big of a change it was?","Eric Steigerwalt","So, the good news on that Alex is -- great to hear your voice again. The good news is, there was no change in that. The data is coming and showing was conservative relative to that. And we actually made that change two years ago to 2% annuitization. So, across the board, if you look at these assumptions, the data is coming in showing us we were proactive, we moved early and were informed by all the richest data available to make those changes. So, it\u2019s really nothing material to call out with respect to actuarial behavior assumption this year.","Alex Scott","Got it. And then, next question I had was just a follow-up on the hedge costs. I think, the VA distributable earnings assumption or estimates you guys have provided in the past suggested maybe you\u2019d to get to a point where the hedge costs were below the rider fees by -- looked like maybe year four or so. I mean, is that expected to significantly speed up? I mean, does that speed up to year 2 or 3 or do you think 2019 could be a year where hedge costs are actually below the rider fees?","Anant Bhalla","Yes. I wish it could be below the rider fees. But I think where we thinking about them is they\u2019re not going to be below the rider fees; they\u2019re just going to be in that $1 billion range, so slightly above the right of fees. So, there\u2019s going to be some modest amount of drag from those fees but still a meaningful amount of reduction which will allow net income to emerge in addition to just operating income or adjusted earnings.","Alex Scott","Last quick one. Did you guys say what adjusted statutory earnings were this quarter?","Anant Bhalla","We did not. But they were around $700 million. Now, that\u2019s because largely our -- two thirds of that coming from our hedge program and a third coming from core business earnings of around $200 million, which you can see in the supplement. So, a very strong, well above our plan, and in October, we would have probably given some of that back, but still good outcome for the year.","Alex Scott","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Eric, in you\u2019re prepared remarks, you talked about you expect the TSA would reduce to 85 TSAs by the end of the year. But, as we think about the expenses impact from this TSA termination, how should we think about that for the full quarter and then maybe into 2019?","Eric Steigerwalt","Sure. Humphrey, good morning. It\u2019s kind of back-end loaded, to be honest with you. Like, you\u2019re seeing expense decreases occurring here and you\u2019re going to see more in 2019. The biggest peace will be end of \u201819 into \u201820 where we really get the leverage of getting off some of the largest ones. All of the smaller ones or even medium sized ones are contributing to our ability to lower expenses, like you saw in the third quarter. And again, there\u2019ll be more of that in \u201819, but as you get near the end and into \u201820, then we get off the biggest ones.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. So, more good to come. And then, I guess maybe shifting gears a little bit. So, related to the recapture of the reinsurance and run-off, can you just provide some color in terms of the size of the recaptures and then how should we think about the earnings impact or maybe the -- from the volatility standpoint? Any color you can provide will be helpful.","Conor Murphy","Humphrey, it\u2019s Conor. The size of the block is a $5 billion block, from the face amount perspective.","Eric Steigerwalt","And I\u2019ll add into Conor\u2019s point of view is as we moved this block of business, really ULSG to run-off in the second -- in the fourth quarter of 2016, this is answering your point of view, how to think about it on an earnings basis, it\u2019s all reflected now in the earnings. When we recapture a block of business, it changes our profit pattern; the present value of that change in profit pattern gets reflected in the reserves. There is no ongoing impact from it.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back to David Rosenbaum for his final remarks.","David Rosenbaum","Thank you, Carmen, and thanks to everyone for joining us today for our third quarter earnings conference call and for your interest in Brighthouse Financial. We look forward to speaking again during our investor outlook conference call on December 3rd. And again, thanks for joining today.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program.

[Operator Instructions]","And I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. David Rosenbaum, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","David Rosenbaum","Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining Brighthouse Financial's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Our earnings release, presentation and financial supplement were released last night and can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at brighthousefinancial.com. We encourage you to review all of these materials, and we will refer to the slide presentation in our prepared remarks.","Today, you will hear from Eric Steigerwalt, our President and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Anant Bhalla, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer period. Also here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of senior management.","Our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Brighthouse Financial's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in Brighthouse Financial's filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Information discussed on today's call speaks only as of today, August 7, 2018. The company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed on today's call.","During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles, also known as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related definitions may be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website, in our earnings release, slide presentation or financial supplement. And finally, references to statutory results are preliminary due to the timing of the filing of the statutory statement.","And now I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Steigerwalt.","Eric Steigerwalt","Thank you, David and good morning, everyone. Today, we are celebrating our one year anniversary as a publicly traded company. And we believe we have much to celebrate. We\u2019ve made significant progress over the past year. We are proud of what we have accomplished and we remain focused on executing our strategy as we believe that will create shareholder value.","An example of the success of our strategy is the announcement we made last night. Our board of directors has approved a $200 million stock repurchase program, our first as an independent publicly traded company and significantly ahead of our base case scenario. From the beginning we have worked diligently to enhance our financial strength and flexibility. This program reflects the progress we have made, the confidence we have in our strategy and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. We expect to prudently manage this over the next year, consistent with the Board\u2019s expectation. ","I\u2019m going to focus the remainder of my comments today around the progress we\u2019ve made with respect to our top priorities for 2018. As a reminder, the top priorities are, first, we are focused on exiting our transition service agreements or TSAs with MetLife. Exiting TSAs supports our goal of reducing our overall cost structure as a standalone company.","Second, we are enhancing our distribution platform and network and developing new products that respond to the evolving needs of our advisors and the clients that they serve. And third, actively managing through NAIC variable annuity capital reform and growing our earnings power.","Let\u2019s begin with TSAs. Exiting TSAs with MetLife and replacing them with more cost effective solutions is essential to executing on our strategy. We began the quarter with 139 TSAs remaining and we were able to exit 12 in the second quarter. We currently anticipate ending 2018 with fewer than 85 TSAs. Consistent with our strategy, exiting TSAs will help us begin to reduce expenses, while solidifying the Brighthouse operating platform.","Second, product and distribution. I am very pleased with our annuity sales results in the second quarter of 2018. Annuity sales of approximately $1.4 billion were up 42% quarter-over-quarter, driven by shield and fixed-indexed annuities. Sales of shield annuities were $723 million in the quarter, up 27% quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter growth in annuity sales reflects the strength of our distribution relationships and the ongoing momentum from our branding initiatives.","I also want to provide a few perspectives on our life insurance business. Product diversification is important to us. We have a large block of life insurance with approximately $421 billion of face amount in force. That\u2019s net of reinsurance as of June 30, 2018. As I\u2019ve said before, one of the key elements of our strategy is to offer a tailored set of annuity and life insurance solutions that are simpler, more transparent and provide value to advisors, their clients and our shareholders.","Consistent with the strategy, we are also focused on growing new sales of life insurance and intend to be a significant player in the industry in coming years. As such, we are targeting the end of this year or the beginning of next year to launch a new life product subject to regulatory approval.","Turning to our second quarter results, our key financial highlights for the second quarter are summarized on slide 3 of our earnings presentation. Results in the second quarter of 2018 were mixed with outstanding quarter-over-quarter sales growth and stable variable annuity assets above CTE95 that were in line with our expectations. However, our earnings were impacted sequentially by higher corporate expenses as expected and unfavorable results in the runoff segment. Sequentially, the runoff segment was impacted by lower alternative investment income and higher claims, both of which can vary from quarter-to-quarter.","Our corporate expenses were $288 million in the quarter, up $58 million sequentially and high watermark for 2018. This expense level was in line with expectations, culminating with corporate expenses in the first 12 months post separation of approximately $1.05 billion. We still expect to reduce these expenses by $150 million on a run rate basis by the end of 2020. We are also making necessary investments in our technology infrastructure and in our businesses. We refer to these investments as establishment costs. ","In the second quarter, establishment costs were approximately $56 million pretax. We still expect to achieve our guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share, less notable items for 2018 of $8.50 to $9 per share. Additionally, we still expect an approximately 8% adjusted ROE less notables in 2018 with meaningful improvement in both 2019 and 2020.","The primary drivers of second half performance are expected to be equity market returns, lower expenses, lower claim severity in universal life with secondary guarantees and higher investment income from continued investment portfolio repositioning. We intend to provide additional guidance on adjusted ROE less notables before the end of this year.","Finally, assets above CTE 95 were flat sequentially at $2.7 billion or more than $0.5 billion of assets above CTE 98. Importantly, these results are in line with our expectations, given favorable markets, lower volatility and normal aging of our block. Before I turn the call over to Anant to discuss our second quarter results in more detail, I would like to provide an update on NAIC variable annuity capital reform which is summarized on slide 4.","We expect the NAIC will approve the framework for variable annuity capital reform today at the conclusion of the NAIC meeting. After approval of the framework, various NAIC committees will begin the process of clarifying certain implementation guidelines. The effective date of the reform is expected to be January 1, 2020. We continue to be supportive of the principles behind this reform and believe it aligns with our view of managing to a total asset requirement.","Based on the framework expected to be adopted today, we believe Brighthouse is well positioned to adapt to the impacts of variable annuity reform and tax reform. Let me provide two thoughts on impacts and implementation timing. First, we intend to incorporate the new variable annuity capital and tax reform frameworks including the equity and interest rate scenarios, behavioral assumptions and the benefits from hedging in our calculation of CTE 95 and CTE 98 beginning in the third quarter.","We expect that the total asset requirement will increase, as a result. However, we expect this increase will be funded by the current assets above CTE 98. Secondly, we are currently considering the potential for early adoption of the NAIC capital reform for statutory reporting, if permitted, enabling us to potentially sunset the current standard scenario framework in our actuarial processes in 2019.","The new reserve framework should help pave the way for growth in ordinary dividend capacity in the years to come as we believe changes in reserves will better align with our hedge target. To wrap up, we are very excited about the initiation of our first stock repurchase program and the value that it creates for shareholders. This program reflects the progress we have made, the confidence we have in our strategy and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. We are pleased with our sales growth in annuities and with our strong operational performance in the quarter. While we had lower sequential earnings this quarter, we still expect to achieve our targets for the year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Anant to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail. Anant?","Anant Bhalla","Thank you, Eric and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the second quarter results and provide some perspectives on the key underlying themes beginning on slide 5. Adjusted earnings, excluding the impact from notable items, were $197 million in the quarter, compared to adjusted earnings on the same basis of $288 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $282 million in the second quarter of 2017. ","The annuity segment continues to perform well and results in the life segment were good, but were impacted by higher expenses. The only notable item in the quarter was establishment costs, lowering adjusted earnings by $44 million after tax or $0.37 per share.","Now, I'd like to provide some perspectives on three themes related to our adjusted earnings this quarter. The first theme for the quarter that I would like to discuss is expenses. Corporate expenses were $288 million in the quarter, up approximately $58 million sequentially and the high watermark for 2018 and consistent with our expectations. On an after tax per share basis, that translates to a $0.38 per share sequential impact.","As seen on slide 6, the corporate expense level in the quarter is approximately $20 million after tax or $0.17 per share, higher than our average quarterly run rate for the first 12 months as a public company. Actual first year corporate expenses were right in the middle of our expected range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion.","The second theme is the investment portfolio. Net investment income was lower sequentially, primarily driven by a decrease in alternate investment income. This was partially offset by growth in assets and the investment portfolio repositioning that we started last quarter. The alternate investment income was approximately $17 million after tax or $0.14 per share lower than the four quarter historical average for 2017 as seen on slide six. This performance is related to weaker results in private equity funds, which we report on a one quarter lag. ","The third theme for the quarter is claims in the run-off segment. Second quarter results were unfavorable sequentially, primarily driven by higher claim severity in the Universal Life with Secondly Guarantees book of approximately $9 million after tax or $0.07 per share as seen on slide six. In addition, incidence in legacy payout annuity blocks in our run-off segment was lower.","Now turning to results at the segment level. Adjusted earnings in the annuity segment were $221 million in the quarter. Sequentially, results reflected higher expenses, partially offset by higher investment income and lower DAC amortization, given the equity market performance this quarter. Net flows partially offset by improved sequential separate account fund performance resulted in an approximate $800 million sequential decrease in annuity account values to approximately $129 million.","Adjusted earnings in the life segment were $37 million in the quarter. Sequentially, results reflect higher expenses. The adjusted loss in the run-off segment was $6 million in the quarter. Sequentially, net investment income was lower as a majority of our private equity assets are in the run-off segment. Additionally, we experienced higher claims, which can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We currently expect the run rate in this segment to be in the $15 million area per quarter, with possible variation quarter to quarter.","Corporate and other had an adjusted loss of $99 million and included a $44 million unfavorable notable item for establishment costs. Expenses were higher sequentially. Let me now close with an update on our capital position and on our VA hedging as of June 30, 2018.","First, we feel very good about our capitalization levels, including prospectively reflecting the expected impacts of variable annuity capital reform and tax reform. Second, with respect to our variable annuity exposure management program, results were in line with our expectations. As seen on slide 7, assets above CTE 95 were approximately $2.7 billion or more than $0.5 billion of assets above the CTE 98 level on a pre-reform basis.","Our hedging programs are working and delivering results in line with our expectations for the market movements in the quarter. Third, total adjusted capital was $6 billion, down $0.5 billion from the prior quarter, driven primarily by the existing variable annuity reserve requirements, which are less sensitive to market movements than our CTE 95 hedging target.","As Eric mentioned, we are currently considering the potential for early adoption of the NAIC capital reform for statutory reporting, if permitted, enabling us to potentially sunset the current framework in our actuarial processes in 2019. Fourth, adjusted statutory earnings were approximately $175 million through the second quarter, in line with our expectations. ","And finally, with respect to our $200 million stock repurchase authorization from the board, we expect the repurchase to be funded out of the existing $569 million of holding company liquid assets as of the end of the second quarter. Additionally, our leverage capacity is consistent with the prior quarter\u2019s levels. As a reminder, we may access the debt markets as and when opportunities present themselves in order to enhance financial flexibility.","With that, we like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Just related to the VA capital reform. So now with greater clarity, how have you changed your view related to your approach to your hedging strategy and the cash flow generation from the inflows block going forward, relative to kind of your -- what you laid out during the roadshow process.","Anant Bhalla","Hi, Humphrey. Good morning. With respect to our hedging strategy, no change in the way we think about it, exactly the same way. You would see us probably talk about capitalization within RBC basis as the CTE 98 framework comes in there, but that doesn't impact the hedging strategy and we will update our sensitivity tables in terms of distributable earnings annually, so with our year-end process, but primarily no real change in our strategy and how we think about it.","Humphrey Lee","So basically you still be over time expect to create 3 billion of asset buffer above CTE 95 level under the new regime and then use that to, in a sense, to reduce your hedging cost? That's still your thinking related to your hedging strategy.","Eric Steigerwalt","Hi, Humphrey. It\u2019s Eric. Look, I think that lies behind it going forward. Right now, certainly, the buffer is important. We've been looking at it and discussing it every quarter as we're doing right now. But I think once we adopt the new framework, you're going to hear us start to talk about as Anant just said frankly, capitalization with respect to RBC because that was the whole point of VA capital reform to make RBC more robust. So I think that answers your question.","Humphrey Lee","And then looking at your realized investment losses, you have 75 million in the quarter or roughly $0.50 in your ECS lost number. My understanding is that is largely driven by kind of repositioning your investment portfolio. I was just wondering like how much yield did you pick up in the process and are you done with that repositioning or should we still expect some realized losses to come through in the coming quarters.","John Rosenthal","Hi, Humphrey. It\u2019s John. I think, one, we're not done with the repositioning. We're going to continue to reposition at treasuries. Two, you're right, most of those losses -- those realized losses in the second quarter were due to trading out of lower coupon treasuries. And three, there will probably be continued losses in the future as we do that.","Humphrey Lee","Is there any way to size the, I guess, the percentage you had done -- you have repositioned relative to your investment portfolio, so like where you stand right now, how are you thinking about the coming quarters.","John Rosenthal","Humphrey, we've rotated it at about $3 billion in the first quarter, first half of the year. As far as -- we're continuing to -- we're continuing to trim the position down. As far as ultimate timing and amount and impact, we're still evaluating that, but we have a bit to go.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.","Jimmy Bhullar","First, I just had a question on the expected timing and pace of your buyback plan and completing the program. Are you going to base it more on just certain price or what's really going to drive, if you could give us any sense of how fast you're going to complete the program?","Eric Steigerwalt","Jimmy, it's Eric. I know that, I guess, many of you would want me to break it down quarter-by-quarter or something like that, but I'm not going to \u2013 ","Jimmy Bhullar","Or just your strategy on it and not looking for actual guidance, but just how are you going to -- are you going to start right now, are you going to evaluate based on where the price is? How would you approach it?","Eric Steigerwalt","Look, we're thrilled that we're at this point. We are going to do all the above. At these prices, I certainly would like to buy back stock. We\u2019ll do it over time and I think you can kind of plug into your model whatever you think is prudent. I think that that that might be a word to use. We're going to be prudent. Look, we've got to watch markets, we've got to think about the company overall, but we have an authorization and we intend to repurchase stock.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then you mentioned elevated Universal Life claims, I think in the secondary guarantee part of the book. How much of that was related to the block that you recaptured it from a reinsurance company.","Anant Bhalla","Hi, Jimmy. It\u2019s Anant. So the block that we recaptured from our former parent last year, prior to separation, was a large traditional block, so that's not ULSG, but there will be some aspects of ULSG as well. Really, the driver there was severity. ","Jimmy Bhullar","I mean, from a third-party reinsurer, the block you recaptured from a third-party reinsurer?","Anant Bhalla","It would be some portion of that, because there was a portion of the ULSG block that was recaptured. We don't have the exact percentages, but yes, there was a portion that was recaptured.","Jimmy Bhullar","And we should assume that the reason you would have recaptured it just was basically increasing the insurance cost, that book should behave worse than sort of \u2013 than a normal UL block, right, because otherwise reinsurance, you would retain the reinsurance relationship, correct?","Anant Bhalla","We recaptured it, because the insurance rate increase was higher than the current rates and so this is pretty standard across the industry. A lot of -- when reinsurers do this, it\u2019s -- they don't do it for a particular company. They do it for the entire block that they've got from multiple companies. So it's not something systemic to us or specific to us.","Eric Steigerwalt","Yeah. Jimmy, it\u2019s Eric. I hear something else in that question too. No, we don't expect it to perform any differently, if that was part of your question.","Jimmy Bhullar","Yeah. No. That's what I meant. My point was that if that's the block that actually had -- or part of your bad experience was in that block, then that might be normal going forward, obviously, not every single quarter, but that's a block that would typically show worse results. Obviously, secondary guarantee UL is behaving worse than normal UL anyway for the industry as a whole?","The last question I had is just on establishment costs. What are your views on how -- like what the total amount is going to be from here on out and when do you think that you will be done with the majority of those expenses?","Anant Bhalla","Hi. It\u2019s Anant again. So we will be done in 2020. We view the expenses from here on to be basically around, in the low 100s for the rest of this year and this is in line with what we provided last quarter in terms of totals, again in the low-100s next year and then just under 50 million in 2020. So cumulative from here on, we\u2019re talking around 250 across those numbers that I say, 250, 275.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger","So in the past, you've talked about \u2013 from a hedging standpoint, putting 1 billion of assets -- of the cushion at risk and then moving that to $3 billion over time, I believe, by 2020. Does that change at all, now that there's this new VA capital framework and you're thinking more about managing to an RBC level, should we think about that specific strategy changing at all?","Anant Bhalla","Hi, Ryan. It\u2019s Anant. That does not change. The hedging strategy stays as it is, as you very eloquently said, we're at 1 billion assets at risk or deductible that we colloquially call it and that's why you got the range of 2 billion to 3 billion above 95, because the deductible will grow from 1 to 2. So almost think of holding a little more than the deductible for the strategy to work. When we talk about excess capital though, we can make that conversation all about RBC post the reform being adopted, because the CTE framework will make, as Eric said, RBC robust.","Ryan Krueger","And then in terms of the shift, is that going to be something that will occur gradually over the next -- over time or will it be more of a -- you get to a certain point in time that you think it's the right time to do it and you\u2019ll move from $1 billion to $2 billion or $3 billion.","Anant Bhalla","Yeah. Well, as we laid out in our projections, we expect to go up like 0.5 billion a year over the passing of each year.","Ryan Krueger","And then just one last on debt issuance that you mentioned, so should we think about the debt capacity that you have as something that would be potentially available to you for future share repurchases looking forward after you get done with this program.","Eric Steigerwalt","It's Eric. I wouldn't think of it that way. I think about it, as we've said from the very beginning, we targeted a 25% leverage ratio and there's all kinds of things you can use it for and if we see opportunities, we want to take advantage of that financial flexibility and by the way term out our capital structure.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","I guess, has anything changed in terms of your expectation of not taking a dividend, excuse me, from BLIC in 2019? And if you can early adopt the VA capital reform, does this change anything for \u201919 \u2013 or 2019 or is that more of a 2020 impact?","Anant Bhalla","Hi, Erik. Anant here. So let me answer your second question first. We will work with the regulators to see if we can early adopt. It's beneficial for us and we would like to look at it, but we have to see how everything comes together. Hopefully, this is passed shortly today. Secondly, on taking BLIC dividends, we're not contemplating BLIC dividends till we early adopt and have the RBC framework drive the requirements. So hopefully that answers your question.","Erik Bass","So then I guess is it right to think of your near term interest expense and any other cash needs are still going to be largely funded by dividends from that?","Anant Bhalla","Yes.","Erik Bass","And then I understand you plan to keep your hedge program set at CTE 95 as the floor rather than changing that to CTE 98, so can you just talk about what the impact would be, if at any point in the future, kind of you dipped below a CTE 98 level at any point?","Anant Bhalla","So CTE 98, in the new framework, will basically translate to a 400% RBC company. As we've shared, we're already above CTE 98 and we'll probably operate above CTE 98 in normal markets, which means we're going to be above 400% RBC. When we protect 95, that means from being above 400% RBC, whatever number we end up being at, meaningfully above it, we\u2019ll basically come back to that range of 400. That's the way you should think about our program, more details to come once the framework is finalized.","Erik Bass","So there wouldn't be any sort of trigger -- problem for dipping below, you just need to sort of rebuild back to your RBC target if that were to happen?","Anant Bhalla","That's correct. It would be no trigger. We would be very robustly capitalized, even if we\u2019re at 95, because you\u2019d see us being at 400 or higher.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with B. Riley FBR.","Randy Binner","Yeah. I wanted to go back to expenses and the timing, I think, Jimmy asked the question, but Anant, when you answered the low-100s this year and next, I think were you referring to the corporate segment? I just wanted to clarify that. And if that is the case, also get a feeling of the timing kind of in the other segments, because we saw higher expenses in the annuity segment as well. So I\u2019m just trying to get a kind of a fuller picture of the pace of those expense improvements that helped the guide in the back half of \u201818.","Anant Bhalla","Hi, Randy. Good morning. Sure. So when we talk about expenses, let's break it out in two categories. Establishment costs, those are the notable item and when I was answering the prior question, I was answering what are your establishment costs from here on, right, so around 275 between here and to 2020 with the breakout that I gave. When it comes to actually expenses that go through each of the segments, it's our operating expense, the corporate expenses, as we talk about it. And those were higher, as Eric and I mentioned, we had a high watermark of 288 a quarter. Those expenses, which are our corporate expenses, our range was to be 1 billion to 1.1 billion. We came in right in the middle of that range in our first year and that is what we will reduce by $150 million by 2020 run rate.","Randy Binner","And then I had another question about one of the run rate items you mentioned near the end of your commentary, it was a 15 million or a 50 million run rate and I think you're referring to the run-off segment, could you -- we just couldn\u2019t hear that on our end?","Anant Bhalla","No worries, happy to clarify. Yes, it was run-off and one, five, 15 million area.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse.","Andrew Kligerman","First question around the CTE 98 greater than 0.5 billion buffer so to speak. When they do implement the final format, tax reform, what might you estimate would be the impact of tax reform on that buffer?","Anant Bhalla","Hi, Andrew. It's Anant. We have given it together. Tax reform, meaning going to 21% tax rate plus we reform. We've answered all these questions with them being together, so we're not pushing that off into the future.","Andrew Kligerman","Do you have a sense of what the capital reform and tax reform together might impact the 500 plus million?","Anant Bhalla","We would expect to still be at 98.","Andrew Kligerman","I see. So it could reduce then some of that 500 million or excess of 500 million?","Anant Bhalla","That is correct and we would organically grow it back.","Andrew Kligerman","And then with respect to drilling a little deeper into the expenses, in the corporate operating expenses, I estimated that if you take out the notables or the establishment costs, corporate operating expenses went from about 17 million to 40 million pretax. So you saw a $23 million pick up and I was kind of curious what that consisted of.","Anant Bhalla","Happy to answer it. So that pick up was basically higher corporate advertising and some many one-time items that we had going through. For example, we had our annual meeting. So shareholder service costs, we have a fair number of -- a number of shareholders and some liquidity facility that we're putting in place to again strengthen our backup resources, all those one-timers are what drove it. Maybe we can help everyone by providing a little view on how to think about corporate expenses on a run rate basis. There are two line items that you would look at, interest costs, which are pretty steady now in the last couple of quarters, plus these other operating expenses, which should constitute basically around 50 million a year or just sub of 50 million a year, driven by shareholder services, advertising, things like that.","Andrew Kligerman","And then with respect -- one last one, just with regard to your sales, I noticed that Lincoln National came out with a buffered product in mid-May. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the competitive landscape in products that are similar to the shield.","Myles Lambert","Yes. It's Myles Lambert speaking. We welcome new entrants into the structured annuity space. We think it further validates the product category and it's a good thing for our consumers and our advisors. We really like the competitiveness of our product, and as always, we\u2019ll continue to monitor the competitive landscape and make changes to our product, if appropriate, but hopefully new entrants into the space just grows the overall category.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi.","Suneet Kamath","First question on the TSA. It sounded like you're targeting some pretty significant reductions in the second half. Any quantification of what the cost savings would be associated with what you're planning.","Eric Steigerwalt","Sorry about that. It's Eric. My mic wasn\u2019t on. Look, it's meaningful, but they're not the biggest pieces, I would say, Suneet. There's two ways to think about getting out of TSAs. One is every time we can exit a TSA and do that activity at a lower cost, you're going to have an expense save. So there are meaningful numbers there. I would say the biggest pieces though are in \u201919 and that's why we've talked historically about \u201919 really being the year where you're going to see a lot of downdraft in expenses, but we said previously that our second or third quarter would be our high watermark. Our second quarter is going to be our high watermark, so you are going to see some degradation of expenses in the third and fourth quarter, but \u201919 is really \u2013 \u201819 and \u201920 are the big years for us. I hope that helps.","Suneet Kamath","And then on the buyback and the capital, since you're funding \u2013 sounds like you're funding that buyback with excess holding company cash, and does not seem to be an expectation for dividends out of the VA business, are we still looking at 2020 in terms of when you'd be comfortable taking dividends out at that kind of level that you had provided in the past.","Eric Steigerwalt","Let me start and Anant will probably jump in here. Look, here's what I would say. We're pretty thrilled to have gotten this buyback authorization from the board and you're right, Suneet, we will do it out of the holding company cash that exists right now. ","The next piece of course is well, over time here, at least shorter term, can you do more? And I'm never going to get ahead of our board, but obviously the answer is maybe. The real key and I think this is what you're getting towards is, we want to end up being a consistent returner of capital to shareholders. So that's the goal. I mean I must admit sort of personally, the original goal was the first buyback. Well, now, we've announced that. As you think about the future, obviously, the next piece is, how do we become a consistent repurchaser of stock and obviously we hope to do that in the coming couple of years. ","Anant, do you want to add anything technically with respect to 2020?","Anant Bhalla","Yes. So with respect to 2020, I would approach it with like three items. I would think of it three drivers to build on what Eric said. One is the adoption of VA capital reform and also early adopting that in 2019 is a great enabler because it really helps our unassigned funds and dividend capacity, so that's one of getting money out of BLIC to answer your specific question.","The second is continuing to see markets perform well and that translating into separate account returns for us. That translation needs to happen. And then finally, what I would really say about this is that we want to make sure that as we implement these items, you continue to see the block perform well and the growth of the new business. So we\u2019re going to see those three elements come through.","Suneet Kamath","And then Anant, just one last one for you if I could. On the $2.7 billion buffer, it was sort of flat versus the first quarter, despite some pretty decent markets and higher rate. Any sense of -- can you give us a sense of kind of the moving pieces? I know, you\u2019ve done this on prior calls in terms of how markets impacted you versus volatility, just as we track this going forward?","Anant Bhalla","Sure. So volatility came down a little bit in the quarter and markets were up. Both those would have a mark-to-market impact and then you have the passage of time along with interest rates. Those are the items I would look at that drove the derivative mark-to-market. Another important consideration, as you think of that derivative mark to market on my prior comment answers, we are going to be building up our deductible from $1 billion to $2 billion over time and that's something we keep in mind, because that also drives, a, the mark-to-market will go down when that happens, but, b, that also drives cash flow out of the Life block, out of the Life company annuity block.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill.","John Barnidge","With your updated guidance, apologies, if you already said it, but can you give us your latest thoughts around the tax rate for the year, or the balance of the year rather?","Anant Bhalla","Our expectation stays the same as earlier, mid to high-teens knowing that we sort of true up in the third quarter, so that\u2019s the quarter where we do a tax rate true up to provision.","John Barnidge","And then my other question, run-offs obviously has lower margins than annuity and also life. I know there's market conditions, but is there anything structurally preventing you from pursuing the divestiture for some or all of that sentiment.","Eric Steigerwalt","Hi. I'll start and maybe anyone else will chime in. Structurally, we have to think of runoff as having a large ULSG block as we've talked about and that would require us working with Delaware, our regulator to, it's a complex reinsurance transaction, it's not as easy as just divesting it.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Scott","I guess the first question was just a follow-up on the comments on the uses of capital from a potential debt issuance. I know you're not ready to talk about what you potentially do with it, but should the expectation be that that will be sort of sitting at the holding company until you decide or is there any need to put it into an operating company?","Eric Steigerwalt","It's Eric. I\u2019ll start. Anant, you can jump in. I would say general flexibility. We'll have to see, I mean, look, it's very nice to be sitting here, talking about the 27 Oliver Wyman proposals here and now having agreement from the regulators and us understanding it to a pretty great degree, but we'll have to see. I consider our excess leverage capacity to be exactly what we've said, since the beginning, financial flexibility. So that's how I would answer it.","Anant, anything to add?","Anant Bhalla","I think you covered it, Eric.","Alex Scott","And then a follow-up question was just on the adjusted statutory earnings you gave, I guess, it was 175. I think you mentioned that was for the first half of the year, so a little less than 40% of GAAP earnings and I was just wondering if you could help us think about what are some of the differences that make that significantly lower and what do you \u2013 like, is that a metric we should be looking closer at, is that a better sort of indicator of the earnings power?","Anant Bhalla","The short answer is yes. That is a better indicator of us being able to grow the assets above CTE 95 and talk about capital return out of the life company. Now, technically to answer your question, how does that differ from stat earnings, in essence, we manage the VA block as you know to funding CTE 95 and at that level of assets above that, this is taking out, so to start with adjusted statutory pretax income, almost 933 of the stat line and take out the existing reserve, AG43 reserve change, which will be sunset with passage of VA reform and include CTE 95 as the required reserve and capital, plus bringing unrealized gains and losses from the hedges, which are not in stat pretax income, but they go through tact, because at the end of the day, you have to grow your total adjusted capital to be able to return any.","Alex Scott","And maybe one quick follow-up on the sunsetting of the standard scenario. I mean if you were to remove the standard scenario today, how much would the, like, I know, not necessarily implications for total asset requirement, but how much would the reserve requirement go down and how much would that benefit your stat surplus if that was removed today?","Anant Bhalla","That is a great question. It would be meaningful and it\u2019s the driver behind my comment about dividend capacity goes up meaningfully.","Alex Scott","So should I take that to mean like over $1 billion?","Anant Bhalla","You should take that to mean it's very meaningful.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Just first to follow up on Alex's question on the sun setting of the current framework. Anant, is the way to think about that could sort of pull forward the, some of the cash flow guidance you've given that initially or at this stage looks like it was a couple of years out and that might pull forward some of that in to 2019, if it all worked out on the sunsetting or any clarity on sort of the mechanics and what the output of that would look like, would be helpful?","Anant Bhalla","Yeah. It helps. Let me explain where it helps the most. To my early answer, really helps with dividend capacity. So it removes any clouds, anyone may have thought we had because of standard scenario and it allows the flow of capital out of the life company to happen in an unencumbered manner through ordinary dividends. That's what it really allows. The core underlying cash flows and the hedging targets and dynamics, all that, none of that really changes.","Tom Gallagher","So it's more the -- would you say the volatility of outcomes related to capital would improve?","Anant Bhalla","Yes. Pretty much.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And then Eric just a higher level question for you. Anything under consideration right now whether it's -- with regard to risk transfer, whether it's VA, life insurance, spread products, I can appreciate when your stock was in the 50s or 60s, how that may not have made sense, but given where -- how the market's valuing your stock now, does that really change anything for you?","Eric Steigerwalt","I don't think it changes with respect to where the stock price is. Our goal is to create shareholder value in the ways we can do it. I mean, the market values the stock, I understand that. I have said previously that everything's on the table. Now, I've also said, look, there is resource constraints to some degree. I mean, we can only do so much in any given year, Tom. But here's what I would say, nothing is off the table, nothing. We will consider anything if we think it's executable and will add shareholder value.","So, the stock at any price, we will still consider anything if we think it's executable and will add shareholder value and we have the resources to do it, I guess, that's inherent in the notion of executable, hopefully that answered and I'm happy to do a follow on if you want.","Tom Gallagher","And then just to be clear, based on what you know today about your initial evaluation of the new rules, you have more than enough capital in the OpCo to deal with the reform or is there still -- is there still some risk that you're going to be doing a debt deal, down streaming capital into the OpCos to deal with initial VA reform requirements.","Anant Bhalla","Tom, I\u2019d answer it the way Eric added \u2013 answered and I\u2019ll add a little more, which is issuing a debt deal when the market opportunity is there to achieve financial flexibility in terms of your capital structure makes sense to us. Now to speculate point of downstream into the OpCo, there are two dynamics at play here. One is, we are looking to be very shareholder friendly by growing our deductible from 1 billion to a higher number, being able to do that by downstreaming capital or whatever is useful or organically growing capital, that is core to our strategy as well as reducing hedge costs. VA reform, we've talked a lot about the upfront impacts, it also changes the sensitivities, which we\u2019ll update at year end. So we\u2019d want to make sure that we can continue to deliver hedge cost reductions. Capital can be helpful for both those things.","Eric Steigerwalt","Tom, I would just add. Look, you heard Anant say, maybe we\u2019ll run at more than 98. So we're, in the end, we're starting to talk about 100 million, 200 million, 300 million here. We're not talking about $1 billion. Does that make sense? Do you get what I'm saying?","Tom Gallagher","Yeah. I do. And then just final question for you guys, heading into 3Q, balance sheet review season, anything that you would flag as kind of watch areas?","Anant Bhalla","No. We do a annual actuarial review in the third quarter, we have nothing we would flag for you at this point in time.","Operator","And we do have a follow-up question from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","Tom actually just asked the question I was going to, but I guess as we think about your third quarter annual assumption review, would we expect you to align your GAAP assumptions with the NAIC scenarios or would you continue to set your own best estimate macro assumptions?","Anant Bhalla","Eric, it's early to answer that. GAAP is based on best estimate. We've got to work through the third quarter process, I maybe like to make one point, which may help. We do not expect our third quarter actuarial process to impact our capital return that was just announced.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today's Q&A session and I'd like to return the call to Mr. David Rosenbaum for any closing remarks.","David Rosenbaum","Thank you, Sandra and thanks everybody for joining us today for our second quarter earnings conference call and for your interest in Brighthouse Financial and we'll speak again next quarter.

We will facilitate a question and answer session towards the end of the conference call in fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the presentation over to David Rosenbaum, Head of Investor Relations. Mr Rosenbaum, you may proceed.","David Rosenbaum","Good morning and thank you for joining Brighthouse Financial's third quarter 2019 earnings call. Our earnings release presentation and financial supplement were released last night and can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at brighthousefinancial.com. We encourage you to review all of these materials, and we will refer to the slide presentation in our prepared remarks.","Today you will hear from Eric Steigerwalt, our President and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Ed Spehar, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer period. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are Myles Lambert, Chief Distribution and Marketing Officer; Conor Murphy, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rosenthal, Chief Investment Officer.","Our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Brighthouse Financial's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in Brighthouse Financial's filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Information discussed on today\u2019s call speaks only as of today, November 5, 2019. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed on today's call.","During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles, also known as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures on a historical basis to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related definitions may be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website in our earnings release, slide presentation or financial supplement. And finally, references to statutory results are preliminary due to the timing of the filing of the statutory statements.","And now I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Steigerwalt.","Eric Steigerwalt","Thank you, David. And good morning everyone. Brighthouse delivered solid results during the third quarter of 2019. Global equity market performance was mixed and while US interest rates declined, our variable annuity capitalization remained in line with the second quarter. Investment income from alternative investments was strong given the second quarter market performance, while prepayment income returned to more normal levels.","Claims results were in line with the prior quarter, and sales remained strong. Moving forward, we remain focused on executing our strategy, which we continue to believe will generate long-term shareholder value. As we have previously discussed, one of our goals is to be a consistent returner of capital over time, and we continue to make progress towards achieving this goal.","We repurchased approximately $126 million of our common stock in the third quarter, and we've continued repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2019 with approximately $49 million of our stock repurchased in October. Since the announcement of our first stock repurchase authorization in August of 2018, we have repurchased a total of $468 million of our common stock through October 2019.","Now, let me turn to third quarter results. Our key highlights for the quarter are summarized on slide 3 of our earnings presentation. First, we had another strong sales quarter. We had approximately $1.8 billion of annuity sales, up 17% compared with the third quarter of 2018. We continue to be very pleased with our sales as well as the quality of new business we are adding each quarter.","Moving to life insurance. We continue to focus on our hybrid life insurance product Brighthouse SmartCare. This is our first life insurance product introduction since becoming an independent public company and as part of our strategy to re-establish a competitive presence in the life insurance market.","The early feedback from our distribution partners has been extremely positive. We have made good progress, adding major distributors for our SmartCare product with a network of over 56,000 advisors, and we intend to roll out this product to additional distributors over time.","Results to date are in line with our expectations, and I'm pleased with the strong sales pipeline as we move into the fourth quarter. Second, total annuity net outflows were approximately $1.1 billion in the quarter, down from both the prior quarter and the third quarter of 2018.","As we've said previously, we expect to see a continued shift in our business mix profile over time as we add more cash flow generating and less capital intensive new business coupled with the runoff of less profitable business.","Third, corporate expenses, which do not include establishment costs were $248 million in the third quarter, consistent with our expectations. We anticipate 2019 corporate expenses to be in line with the 2018 full year level, as we continue to transition to the Brighthouse operating platform.","We are still projecting $150 million of corporate expense reduction on a run rate basis by year-end 2020 and an additional $25 million of corporate expense reduction in 2021.","Fourth, we are continuing to make the necessary investments in our technology infrastructure and in our businesses. We refer to these investments as establishment costs. In the third quarter, establishment costs were approximately $13 million pre-tax and $85 million before tax through the first three quarters of the year. Let me provide a few perspectives on establishment costs going forward.","First, we have made significant progress setting up our technology infrastructure and branding our company, and we are pleased that we have exited 163 transition service agreements or TSAs with only 56 remaining. Second, we believe establishment costs will be $295 million to $325 million before tax on a cumulative basis for 2019 through 2021.","This is higher than our initial estimate of $175 million to $200 million before tax as a result of two factors. The first is that we expect some of the more complex TSAs with MetLife to take a little longer and cost more to exit than previously thought. The second factor is that we are making additional investments in our company as we transition to our future state operating platform. We currently expect establishment costs to be between $120 million and $130 million in 2019, $150 million to $160 million in 2020, and $25 million to $35 million in 2021 all on a pre-tax basis.","In the end, I'm very pleased with respect to how we're doing with establishment costs and exiting the TSAs, but we are being prudent in how we are managing our way through the final couple of years.","Next, let me touch on our earnings results. Adjusted earnings, less notable items decreased sequentially driven by less favorable equity market results as compared with the second quarter of 2019. We still anticipate low double-digit percentage growth in adjusted earnings per share, less notable items in 2019 versus 2018. Normalized statutory earnings were very strong in the quarter at approximately $600 million.","And finally, we continue to prudently manage our variable annuity capitalization. As we have talked about previously, we are managing our VA business to CTE98 or higher. As of the end of the third quarter, our VA assets were approximately $1.5 billion in excess of CTE98, consistent with our strategy and in line with the second quarter results. Our hedging program continues to perform well across a wide range of economic conditions and in line with our expectations.","To wrap up, we delivered solid results during the third quarter of 2019, as we continue to execute our strategy. Our sales remained strong, our hedging program continued to perform well, and we repurchased more of our common stock.","Going forward, we remain confident in our strategy, which we believe will enable us to generate long-term value for our shareholders, our distribution partners, and the clients they serve.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ed to discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail. Ed?","Edward Spehar","Thank you, Eric, and good morning everyone. I'm very excited to be on my first earnings call as CFO. I believe in our strategy and most importantly, the team executing that strategy. I'm pleased by our solid business results, robust capital position and the talented and engaged employees at Brighthouse Financial.","Since the separation, the financial management strategy has been to protect the statutory balance sheet and deliver distributable earnings over time. A focus on distributable earnings means a focus on cash.","Over the past three decades, I have maintained that the surest way to create value in the life insurance industry is to manage for cash. So I'm thrilled, this is a key element of the Brighthouse strategy. Overall, I look forward to working with the entire Brighthouse team to generate long-term value for our shareholders, our distribution partners, and the clients they serve.","Now, turning to our results. Last night we reported third quarter adjusted earnings, excluding the impact from notable items of $260 million, which compares with adjusted earnings on the same basis of $296 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $314 million in the third quarter of 2018.","Sequentially, results were impacted by less favorable market performance and lower net investment income along with a modest increase in corporate expenses. There were three notable items in the quarter, which on a net basis lowered adjusted earnings by $429 million.","The notable items on an after-tax basis were establishment costs of $10 million in Corporate & Other, a $23 million benefit in Corporate & Other from a revaluation of tax items related to the separation from MetLife, and a $442 million charge from the annual actuarial review, primarily in the Run-off segment.","As part of the annual actuarial review, we examine assumptions in three categories. Capital markets, business model, and policyholder behavior. The charge associated with this year's annual review is driven by a change in our capital market assumptions. Specifically, a reduction in the assumed GAAP long-term mean reversion rate for the 10-year treasury from 4.25% to 3.75%.","We continue to assume that mean reversion occurs over the next 10 years. The negative impact from the lower assumed interest rate was primarily driven by our Run-off block of universal life with secondary guarantees. There was a modest impact on our annuity segment from the change in the mean reversion rate.","Most of our GAAP VA guarantee reserves are currently accounted for as insurance reserves and are therefore relatively insensitive to interest rates. VA guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives are sensitive to current market rates, not the mean reversion rate. It is also worth noting that the change in the mean reversion rate had no impact on our statutory results.","Turning to adjusted earnings less notable items, I would like to discuss the underlying themes impacting results. Let's begin with market performance. Equity market performance was mixed in the quarter. The S&P 500 total return was 1.7% and the Nasdaq total return was 1.3%.","While the Russell and MSCI EAFE indices had negative returns. Bond returns were positive given the decline in rates. All in, these factors drove separate account returns of positive 0.8% in the quarter, less than 1 percentage point below our base case assumption and approximately 3 percentage points below the second quarter of 2019.","As a result of less favorable market performance, DAC amortization and reserves increased sequentially for a combined unfavorable impact to adjusted earnings of $25 million or $0.22 per share. Next, net investment income decreased sequentially by approximately $11 million after tax. The decrease was driven primarily by lower alternative investment returns. In addition, prepayment income returned to more normal levels in the third quarter, which also contributed to the sequential decline in net investment income. Asset growth was a partial offset, primarily driven by our continued strong sales momentum.","Moving to corporate expenses. In the third quarter, corporate expenses were $248 million, up approximately $6 million from the second quarter and consistent with our expectations.","As Eric mentioned, we still anticipate 2019 corporate expenses to be in line with the 2018 level, as we continue to transition to the Brighthouse operating platform.","Now, I'd like to make a few comments on segment earnings. Starting with annuities, adjusted earnings excluding notable items were $233 million in the quarter. As I mentioned, market impacts and net investment income were lower sequentially, which had an unfavorable impact on earnings.","Additionally, taxes were higher relative to the second quarter. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items in the life segment were $54 million in the quarter. Sequentially, results were impacted by higher expenses, partially offset by lower life insurance claims.","The Run-off segment reported adjusted earnings excluding notable items of $5 million in the quarter. The sequential decrease was driven by lower net investment income and higher reserves, partially offset by lower taxes. Corporate & Other had an adjusted loss excluding notable items of $32 million. Sequentially, results were driven by lower taxes, partially offset by higher expenses.","To wrap up, I would like to provide an update on our capital position as of September 30. Our hedging program continues to perform well and in line with our expectations. Assets above CTE98 were approximately $1.5 billion at September 30, in line with the second quarter. Normalized statutory earnings were approximately $600 million in the third quarter, primarily driven by gains from our VA hedging program.","Year-to-date normalized statutory earnings were more than $1.2 billion. Statutory combined total adjusted capital was approximately $8.4 billion, up $1.5 billion sequentially. The result this quarter is representative of the total adjusted capital, we would anticipate post VA reform, which we still plan to adopt at year-end 2019. Going forward, we expect changes in reserves will better align with our hedge target.","Finally, our average financial leverage ratio was approximately 23% and our holding company liquid assets were approximately $800 million at the end of the third quarter or roughly four times our holding company cash target. The sequential decline in holding company liquid assets was primarily driven by share buybacks.","It is worth highlighting that we have more than $200 million of annual inflows to the holding company before consideration of any dividends from our operating subsidiaries.","These inflows cover most of the roughly $240 million of annual debt service and all other holding company outflows. I would also like to note that we plan to take dividends from Brighthouse Life Insurance Company or BLIC starting in 2020. Overall, I am pleased with the results this quarter. We maintained our strong VA capital position, and we continue to prudently manage our statutory balance sheet. Adjusted earnings less notable items were solid and as Eric said, we still anticipate low double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share less notable items in 2019 versus 2018.","With that, we'd like to turn the call over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Just add a few follow-ups on the final things you mentioned at the end there. The BLIC starting to take dividends coming in 2020, can you expand a bit on that in terms of whether it's the levels or range and what would the driver and source of that be?","Edward Spehar","Hey, good morning, Tom. So I don't want to get into specifics about what dividends, we might take next year from BLIC, but I would just point out that with the $1.5 billion sequential increase in total adjusted capital, we had a similar increase in unassigned funds at BLIC.","So BLIC's unassigned funds were negative $350 million at the end of the second quarter and that increased to positive $1.2 billion at the end of the third quarter. And as you know, that's an important number when you think about dividend capacity.","Tom Gallagher","And just a follow-up on that, any way of gauging dividend capacity and I know you're not done with the final stat filings obviously for 2019, but do you have -- can you give some perspective on what -- how that would change capacity for dividends?","Edward Spehar","Well, when I talk a little bit about how we think our balance sheet at the end of the third quarter reflects, what we believe it will look like under VA reform. So, if we first step back and say, why do we like VA reform? We like VA reform because we end up with a regulatory framework that's consistent with how we manage the risk.","And at the end of the third quarter, what you had was a statutory balance sheet that was consistent with how we manage the risk and therefore representative of what we would expect TAC to be with VA reform.","And the reason for that is, we've had a decline in interest rates, as you know, in the year to date, and as a result of that decline in interest rates, we've seen an increase in post-VA reform reserves and the convergence with the standard scenario reserve, which is what's on our balance sheet today.","Not surprisingly, with the increase in the post-VA reform reserves, we've also seen appreciation in our hedge portfolio. And those unrealized gains in the hedge portfolio is what's driven the significant increase in TAC that we saw in the third quarter.","So, I think -- I would still go back to focusing on that increase in TAC and the significant unassigned funds and ask you to sort of use that as some guide to think about dividend capacity from BLIC over the coming years .","Tom Gallagher","Okay. That's helpful perspective. And then just final quick question, can you give some perspective on how the hedges performed versus other assumption changes to get your, your neutral $1.5 billion VA buffer for the quarter?","Edward Spehar","Sure, so as you pointed out, the assets above CTE98 were $1.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, which is essentially the same as the end of the second quarter, but there is a good underlying story to that number. We had approximately a $400 million benefit from our VA risk management program in the quarter, as our hedge portfolio gains were greater than the increase in our total asset requirement.","That performance was driven by our interest rate derivatives, where we had about $900 million gain in the quarter. This $400 million positive was offset by the actuarial assumption review on a statutory basis of about $400 million. There were a variety of items that impacted the statutory assumption review, the largest of which was a change in expense allocation to the annuity business.","Importantly, this has nothing to do with total Company expenses. As you know, total Company expenses are coming down. This was simply an allocation, and so that was really the offset. The one other thing I'd point out is that there was no impact on the statutory results from the change in the GAAP mean reversion rate.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. Just hoping you could provide more detail on exactly what goes into the establishment costs bucket, kind of how you determine what goes there versus normal course expenses and how much of what goes into the separation cost is driving ultimately the targeted expense savings that you've talked about?","Eric Steigerwalt","Hey, Erik, it's Eric. I missed your last one, could you just repeat that second part?","Erik Bass","Yeah. The second was just how much of kind of the establishment costs are ultimately driving the $150 million of expense savings over time in terms of I guess the TAC that you're adding in efficiencies. I guess is there a linkage between the two?","Eric Steigerwalt","Got it, okay. So the first part, look, we have a reasonably rigorous process around what goes into establishment costs and what we consider run rate, and I guess that's probably the best way to think about it, right? If costs are going to continue theoretically forever, well then they're certainly not establishment costs, they're just normal run rate costs.","If you think about like how we started, the branding, the original branding initiatives were one-time cost, right? We were not going to continue those once we felt that the company was at a certain level, then those costs no longer go into establishment costs.","A number of the costs associated with still being -- still having administration and operations at MetLife and then transferring those either to ourselves or mostly to some of our partners like DXC establishment costs. Okay. So one-time in nature ends up in establishment costs, anything that very much looks like just an ongoing expense ends up in normal corporate expenses.","And then with respect to the drivers. Yeah, I mean there is obviously a number of very important drivers. Take the move for Brighthouse to Multi-Asset Management, right? That's a real cost saver for us, but also getting out of legacy systems, transferring to our new administrative platform is a big driver of costs. Those are probably two of the bigger buckets.","So, we do not believe, given what I said a little bit higher one-time cost is going to affect either the 150 target that we have out there or that extra $25 million in the following year, but we are being prudent with respect to the final couple of years here, as I said in my opening remarks. This is complicated. It's probably not a surprise to many of you that, that in a few areas, it's even more complicated than we thought. Some of these expenses, as I mentioned, are going to go to investments.","You know, the patient is opened as it were, and we're going to -- we're going to do some things that otherwise we might not have been able to do. But also, we're going to be rigorous about QA testing, etc., etc., double staffing from time to time to make sure that we finish out the movement out of the TSAs, the way we've been able to do it so far. Hope that helps.","Erik Bass","Yes, thank you. And then just one follow-up on expenses. You talked about the 150 run rate, I think getting there by the end of next year -- how should we think about the expense savings coming through in 2020 kind of over the course of the year?","Eric Steigerwalt","You mean as we - as we head towards the 150?","Erik Bass","Exactly. So should it be sort of ratably throughout the year, kind of more in the back half or any perspective on how to think about it?","Eric Steigerwalt","Yes, more in the back half. Absolutely. We got a lot to do in the first part and then you will see expenses start to come down in the second half of 2020.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi, thank you. Good morning. My first question on Tom -- one of Tom's questions, you guys were going through the components of the assumption review, and I think you guys mentioned a change in expense allocation to the annuity business. Just was hoping to get a little bit more color on what's going on there, and if you can quantify the impact there?","Edward Spehar","Sure. Hi. Elyse, it's Ed. So, of that roughly $400 million impact from the actuarial assumption review on stat, something like 240 million of it was related to this expense allocation and this was, again no change in the overall expenses, as you just heard from Eric. We continue to have expenses coming down and expect that will be what we'll see next year as well.","But what we did see was based on some time study work, some product work that we did that we determine that there was a greater level of expenses that should be aligned to the in-force annuity business and what you have here is you have a multiplier effect.","So, this roughly $240 million impact that we see from the assumption review is really like roughly a 5 times multiplier on the change in the expense allocation. Because the -- you're assuming that these expenses are going to be higher going forward, and it's an ongoing impact therefore on the total asset requirement.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of the dividends from BLIC next year, can you give us a sense of timeframe and just how we should think about, thinking about capital at the Holdco and potential share repurchases in 2020?","Edward Spehar","Yeah, hi, Elyse, sorry I just have to go back to in appointing you to the unassigned funds of $1.2 billion, and I guess one piece of additional color I would add is that, I think, I'm going to anticipate what I might get here on this topic of the unassigned funds because I just said we had unrealized gains in the hedge portfolio drive the TAC increase and the improvement in unassigned funds.","So, I am anticipating someone might say well what happens, how should we think about unrealized gains and what that means for both of those numbers? If we go back to when we first started talking about VA reform in 2018, we had communicated that we thought there would be a material benefit to our total adjusted capital from VA reform.","And at the time, interest rates were more than a 100 basis points, I believe more than 100 basis points above where they are today. If we were to go back to where we were, if rates were to go up 100 basis points, we would anticipate that these unrealized gains in the hedge portfolio would be eliminated.","But we would also anticipate that our reserves would come down by a similar amount, and so we would expect that total adjusted capital and unassigned funds would look pretty much like what you saw at the end of the third quarter everything else being equal.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That is helpful. And then in terms of last question, as we - people think about I know some of us modeling it and some of us don't modeling these establishment costs into EPS. Is there a rule of thumb to think about modeling them in - throughout the quarters of 2020, kind of even or does it, does it feel more front loaded?","Edward Spehar","Yeah, I don't think we can give you much guidance on timing, and there is a fair amount of uncertainty around how these will flow through quarter-to-quarter as you've seen already. I think the best bet at this point is to divide by four.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Krueger","Hi. Thanks, good morning. I guess what is the interest rate assumption in the GAAP SOP reserves for variable annuities and what would cause that to change. I guess I thought it would have needed to change as part of the assumption review as well.","Edward Spehar","Sorry, Ryan. Could you clarify that, maybe try one more time?","Ryan Krueger","Yeah, I guess in the, you lowered your long-term interest rate by 50 basis points, but I think you said it had no impact on the SOP reserves for variable annuities. Can you give us a sense of what the interest rate assumption is in the SOP reserves for variable annuities and what would cause that to -- you to change that?","Edward Spehar","Yeah. Hi, Ryan. So, the separate account return assumption, I think which is going to include obviously both the equity and fixed income return is unchanged at 6.5%. So, I think maybe that's what you're getting at in terms of the return assumption associated with the VA business.","The reason that you saw a little sensitivity to the interest rate change for our annuity business is really all of the change in the mean reversion for annuities came through in DAC and is really associated with lower future spread income, so lower gross profits on the fixed side.","The VA guarantees most of those are accounted for as insurance, and they are relatively insensitive to this mean reversion rate and the portion that's accounted for as an embedded derivative is sensitive to rates, but it's sensitive to market rates, not the mean reversion rate.","Ryan Krueger","Got it. Thanks. And then I guess going forward, are you still planning to manage variable annuity capital to an assets above CTE98 framework or would you anticipate a shift in more to an RBC ratio following the full implementation of VA reform?","Edward Spehar","Yeah, I think we would. I mean, I don't know whether there's going to be a change in how we manage assets above CTE98. I think the goal would still to be CTE98 plus in normal markets and to protect CTE95 across markets. But I think managing to an RBC framework is going to work for us now, because I think as you've heard us say we have an RBC capital framework that aligns with that how we think we should manage the risk.","I would just say on RBC, we ended 2018 with a 485% RBC ratio and where we sit today, we don't believe there is going to be a material difference in our RBC ratio at the end of 2019, post VA reform.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Andrew Kligerman","Hey. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about the establishment costs. So, the new guidance is about $120 million higher than original. That's more than a 60% increase in what you were originally guiding. And I think, Eric, you said it was the complexity of the TSAs as one and the additional investments that you're making, could you break out those two pieces in terms of the parts of the 120 and maybe provide a little more clarity on how such a big change could occur only in a couple of years?","Eric Steigerwalt","Yeah, sure, Andrew. Look, I've been involved in a number of these big transformational efforts and try as we might to get the original projections correct. It's very difficult. Especially in a situation where we want to make sure this works, right? We really only have one shot at this, right? As we've discussed previously, MetLife is not in the TSA business. They have their own strategy and it doesn't include being a TSA provider to Brighthouse.","So, as we get off these, and we've been pretty successful at getting off the majority of them now, we want to make sure that we get this right, as we move from Met either to internal ops or into some of our large service providers going forward. So, in the end, the number here that we will have spends will be somewhere in the $700 million range. It's a big number.","So, we were reasonably confident in our numbers obviously when we gave them our or we wouldn't have given them out, but the idea that we've had a revision in these numbers is not overly surprising given the magnitude of this project.","So I would say -- then, kind of, to your second question, I would say maybe 60% plus would be additional resources associated with finishing off the biggest TSAs and that includes things like double staffing for longer periods than you would have liked to, but I think prudence calls for that and that's what we're going to do and then less than 40%.","But still a reasonable number, our investments that we're going to be able to make, again because as I said before, the patient is open if you will, and it's a good time to do some things that heretofore you wouldn't have even known would have been valuable necessarily, but now, given the focus on advisor experience and customer experience, et cetera, I want to make these investments. So, hopefully that gives you a sense on, on what we're doing here and why -- the math behind the increase.","Andrew Kligerman","Yes. Thank you. And then shifting over to the derivative gains. They were over $1 billion and I'm trying to get a sense of how they were so big, given that the 10-year treasury yield fell 32 basis points in the third quarter of '19 that compared with a 42 Bps drop in the second quarter of '19, whereas in the second quarter of '19, the derivative gains were just about 149 million. So maybe you could give a little color on what those hedging instruments where and why the big differential from 2Q '19?","Edward Spehar","Hi, Andrew, it's Ed. So, I think one piece you need to consider when you look at the second quarter versus the third quarter is the equity side. So, you know we had equity losses in the second quarter, which I think sort of mitigated the benefit from some of the interest rate positions.","And I guess I would just say that a 30-some basis point decline in a 10-year in one quarter is a, is a significant move. So - and also consider the fact that when we hedge interest rates and equities, we have at the money as well as out of the money protection.","Andrew Kligerman","Okay. And again just the change in total adjusted capital, so that was just simply a -- and when you tie that into the capital in excess of CTE98, that was simply an expense allocation and it boosted the unassigned funds and does that materially change your dividend capacity at BLIC versus last quarter or were you planning to dividend - I know you didn't disclose the number, but would you have been dividending [ph] a similar [indiscernible] had you not seen that change in unassigned funds?","Edward Spehar","Okay. So Andrew, let me go back to the comments I made about the change in unassigned funds. So, because we had a statutory balance sheet at the end of the third quarter, that's really representative of how we manage the risk and therefore representative of what we think we're going to see under VA reform.","We captured a large benefit in terms of TAC relative to the second quarter and so that really explains the $1.5 billion increase both in total adjusted capital as well as unassigned funds. It really isn't related to the expense piece. I think what you're referencing on expenses is the gain that we saw - the gain we would have seen in assets above CTE98...","Andrew Kligerman","Right...","Edward Spehar","Was eliminated by the statutory actuarial assumption review. So, it was an effective offset [ph]yet $400 million positive from our VA risk management and you had about $400 million negative from the actuarial assumption review and the bulk of that was related to expense allocation. Okay. Again, not the level of expenses across the Company, simply how much of our expenses we allocate to the [indiscernible] business.","Andrew Kligerman","I see. Thanks, Ed.","Edward Spehar","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hey. Good morning. Just on the expense allocation. Just to clarify, there was an offsetting impact, I think in the life business. So, it's still no impact as you mentioned, for the overall company?","Edward Spehar","Yeah. Hi, Jimmy. It's Ed. There was on the GAAP side, not on the stat side.","Jimmy Bhullar","Got it. And then on your capital, obviously benefited a lot from the -- from your hedges and especially the interest rate derivative that you have any sort of color on the duration of those hedges in sort of a waterfall in how much roughly expires within the next one, two, three years. Just so we can get an idea on your sensitivity to future changes in rates and\/or other sort of factors.","Edward Spehar","Sure. So, as you know, we carefully manage the maturity profile of the hedges, so that we're never in a position where we have significant roll risk during a market dislocation, elevated period of volatility, et cetera. If you look at our hedges, the average life of those hedges are in the range of two to five years for bulk equity and...","Jimmy Bhullar","And pretty even...","Edward Spehar","All those categories.","Jimmy Bhullar","And pretty evenly spread in that period or is it more that, there, like most of them expire in two years versus five?","Edward Spehar","Yes and pretty evenly spread, sort of going back on the comment I made upfront about how we want to make sure we manage the maturity profile of this book, so that we're never in a position where we have to roll too much at one time.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then just on establishment costs and there are a lot of questions on this. Should we assume that once you are through this period, let's say 2021 or whenever sort of you're done with your projects, will these expenses entirely go away or do some of them, we have a lot of companies do these projects and then the cost go into the business, and the company never really benefits and so how do you think about?","Should we assume that at some point in the future, let's say 2022, that all of these costs are going to be gone or would some of them stay with you in one or the other divisions, so how do you think about that?","Eric Steigerwalt","Hey, Jimmy. It's Eric. No, they have to go away. I mean, frankly, I hope they could have gone away in '21. Now, you see, we've still got a little bit in '22 just following our methodology and I won't go through my longer explanation that I did a little while ago but, but these are truly establishment costs.","If we got in a situation where we wanted to make another sort of meaningful investment, we would talk about it as that, but establishment costs have to end at some point because the company has to be established at some point.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Scott","Hi. Good morning. First question I had on just the normalized statutory earnings. You mentioned, it's 600 million. I think it was also mentioned that some of that had to do with variable annuity hedge gains.","So I just wanted to find out, I mean is that normalized statutory earnings numbers synonymous with variable annuity distributable earnings, and once, once you've adopted the reform, like how much economic value were you able to create this quarter?","Eric Steigerwalt","Hey, Alex. It's Eric. Let me, I just want to make sure because I know you. All right, these numbers down. On my last answer, I said '22 and I meant '21 on Jimmy's question. So, Ed, I'll turn this over to you now.","Edward Spehar","Okay. Thanks, Alex. So first of all, just let me give a definition of what we mean when we talk about normalized statutory earnings. So, we start from net gain from operations directly from the stat statements. So, we take pre-tax net gain from operations, we adjust out whatever the current period changes in the VA stat reserves, because as we said, we're trying to get to sort of how we're managing the business. We then add in the change in the total asset requirement under CTE95.","So, we basically get the reserves on a basis of how we're managing the business. Then, we add in realized gains and all of the unrealized gains attributed to the VA business, and then finally we'll normalize for stuff like the actuarial assumption review, establishment costs, et cetera.","So, the $600 million - the approximately $600 million number you referenced, let's just say in the neighborhood of $450 million was VA or was the annuity business and the rest was non-VA. This was a particularly good quarter for non-VA. I wouldn't expect that to be kind of the normal run rate.","We had some timing adjustments related to reinsurance that gave us a benefit above what I would expect normally from the non-VA business. But that was really the number that we would think -- is this sort of normalized statutory earnings is the number that we would think is more indicative of the type of distributable earnings power that you have over time. Obviously, it's going to move depending on market conditions in the quarter.","Alex Scott","Okay. And then just thinking through RBC 485, it wasn't that long ago where I guess there wasn't much of a buffer on CTE98, which I think would probably place you closer to 400. So, it's a pretty big delta and I appreciate the rates have moved a lot, and equity markets have moved a lot in that time period.","But I guess, how would you guys think about drawing down that RBC ratio if the normalized statutory earnings, let's say, aren't coming through or weaker associated with the environment, would you be willing to draw that down at all or do you feel like you need to have that higher RBC ratio because of the volatility that it will have?","Eric Steigerwalt","Yes. So, I guess the first thing you mentioned the equity market. We shouldn't ignore the fact that the stock market is up more than 20% year to date, right? So that's a very significant positive impact, and as I think you're alluding to, you saw that benefit in the assets above CTE98. At the end of 2018, we had $300 million of assets above CTE98.","At the end of the third quarter, it was $1.5 billion. So, when we talk about distributable earnings in the 10-K, we've talked about -- we've given ranges based on the assumption of having assets of $2 billion to $3 billion above CTE95. So, there is an impact on distributable earnings based on the starting point of where we are with our capital position.","Alex Scott","Got you. Is it fair to say there is some flexibility to, have that RBC come down lower and still be comfortable with the way you're hedging and managing the VA business?","Eric Steigerwalt","Yeah. I guess, as you said, if you look at the VA business post VA reform, RBC of 400 is equivalent to roughly CTE98. Now, keep in mind, we're not just a VA company. I mean we have, you know, let's just say round numbers $200 billion of assets with $90 billion of a general account.","So there is a good portion of our capital that's non-VA, so you can't just look at if we are pure VA company, 400% would be a CTE98, but it's not that simple with us. I would just go back to what I said earlier that the plan is still to manage our capital, so that we're at CTE98 plus in normal markets and to protect CTE95 across market cycles.","Alex Scott","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Ryave with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ian Ryave","Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple. Stock buybacks have definitely been healthy in the last couple of quarters. I am guessing this had to do with that $400 million dividend from NELICO was that a kind of a driver to some of the buybacks the last couple of quarters?","-Edward Spehar","Yeah, Ian. I think that's correct.","Ian Ryave","Okay. Great. And then relatedly if I think about all the pieces, right? You have 4 times fixed coverage at the Holdco, you are going to be getting regular dividends from NELICO and then regular dividends from BLIC in the next year. And speaking about the sources and uses of capital, is there anything to suggest that you couldn't do a similar level of buybacks per quarter in 2020?","Eric Steigerwalt","There is - it's Eric. There is nothing to suggest we couldn't, no. You sort of listed out most of the litany. I can even pick-up off the last little conversation that Ed was having. Look, we have a number of levers. Whether it's some room in the RBC ratio, whether it's a potential dividend from BRCD, whether it's the NELICO dividend that we would get, etc., or even at this time, what we've got at the holding company with respect to liquidity.","So, the answer to your question is no. There is nothing that would prevent something similar. I just want to add that at the same time, we are not oblivious to markets. We are managing this company every single day.","So we have - you are alluding to the $1.5 billion capital return target, which we want to still hit, but we will always manage it prudently. I think we covered your question.","Ian Ryave","Yeah. And then just lastly, because we've been talking about the unassigned funds, as an important driver when thinking about dividend capacity , so what would be the drivers that would cause to go the other way, perhaps in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year?","Edward Spehar","Yeah, Ian. It's Ed. So, we're not going to get into specific numbers obviously, but I tried to give you a sense that the reason we like VA reform is that we have a statutory framework that we think makes sense for how we manage the risk and so that means that we should see assets and liabilities moving together. It won't always be perfect.","But as I said earlier, in a scenario where rates go back up 100 basis points, I know, no one ever seems to think that can happen, but if rates go back up 100 basis points, we would expect a very similar movement on both sides of the balance sheet and a total adjusted capital number that would be similar to what you saw at the end of the third quarter.","The one other thing, I know you were - on your first question, you're talking about the sort of sources and uses. The one other thing I would just add to that, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks is that we have over $200 million of annual flows coming in to the holding company unrelated to dividends from the operating companies.","Ian Ryave","Right. That's true. Perfect. That's all really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is OPEN","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Just one on capital as well. Eric, you just mentioned the potential dividend out of the reinsurance subsidiary. I know we talked about this on the last quarter call, but any update in terms of conversations with regulators, and are you able to size how big a dividend you could take out of that sub?","Eric Steigerwalt","Yes, Suneet. I know even the lilt in my voice sometimes gets commented on, but look, there is a process to do this. We remain very comfortable that we have excess capital in BRCD, but I don't want to front run the regulators. We have a very nice relationship with them and so we're working through the process.","I repeat, I believe, we believe that we have excess capital there, and we've also hedged BRCD's capital position. So we're hedged generally to interest rates here. So, I can't comment on where we actually are in the process, but I'll tell you we're in the middle of it.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then just back on the TAC in the quarter. And I guess what you said about if rates go up, you'd see offsetting movements in terms of the reserves in the capital or the unrealized gain, but if rates just remain flat, would we expect there to be sort of a negative impact on the reserves and no change in the unrealized gain?","Edward Spehar","Yeah. Hi, Suneet. Over time, you would expect to see that. I guess I'd say we've shown you in the sensitivities that we provide in the 10-K, the various impacts of different interest rate scenarios and clearly, as Eric said, rates low for a long period of time, it does have an impact on the business. We\u2019ve talked about that and we've shown you that.","Suneet Kamath","Right, okay. And then just maybe lastly on this, on this improvement in the TAC. Did this - how much of this was due to the derivatives that you've bought last quarter. I know, we spent some time talking about that, that you are opportunistic, but was that - were those purchases a big driver of this improvement in TAC that we're seeing?","Edward Spehar","Yeah, I guess I would say that clearly helped. I mean I think the bulk of the additional interest rate protection that we had, it was in the first quarter and it helped. Now, I know we've had some discussion about the notional amounts in the VA tables, you will see an increase in notional again for VA derivatives when you see the third quarter Q.","But it's not really indicative of any material change in our interest rate protection this quarter. I mean notionals are rough guide. It can have double counts in there, but offsetting position. So I am just going to tell you that there was no material change in our protection third quarter versus the second quarter.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Josh, please check your mute button.","Edward Spehar","Operator, they might be on another call. So we can, we\u2019re going to stay on for those of you have to get on another call, but we'll stay on. We've got one more question.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","John Barnidge","Thanks. Can you talk about how the battle for shelf space has changed this year given the decline rates, but also maybe now that you're further removed from Met and demonstrating independence as a company?","Eric Steigerwalt","Yeah, I don't know. It doesn't seem to have changed that much. Our situation is a little different obviously because we had to brand ourselves, which you're kind of pointing to. But at this point, you know we've said over a couple of conference calls that we get inbound calls from distributors. Its business though. You got to, you got to fight every day for it. But I feel really good about our abilities in the marketplace across, you know, literally hundreds of distributors. Myles, you want to add anything?","Myles Lambert","Yeah, sure. Absolutely. Thank you, Eric. So what I would say is that with the annuity side of the business, we are getting inbound calls as it relates to expanding and offering our annuity solutions to new firms. We're also expanding with the annuity business into new channels, channels that we haven't been in the past and it relates to SmartCare.","I mean, we\u2019ve been incredibly pleased with the demand from a number of firms, major firms out there that would like to have the SmartCare product on their platform. So as it relates to expanding distribution, bringing on new firms, and entering new channels, it hasn't been a challenge at all for us.","John Barnidge","Okay. And then my follow-up. Another life insurer had a large write-down in the quarter on a private equity position. Can you quantify among your private equity and venture capital positions you have, maybe what the average investment size, how many of them you have, and what is the largest carrying value? Thanks for the answers.","John Rosenthal","Hi, it's John. So, we have a portfolio that is well diversified across strategies, managers, geographies, and advantages. We own about 300 funds and the average fund size is a little north of $6 million.","And to the last part of your question, our largest two indirect underlying portfolio company positions are each about $25 million. The next largest is below $15 million.","Operator","Okay. I am showing no further questions. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Mr Steigerwalt for closing remarks.","Eric Steigerwalt","Thank you, operator. For those of you who are able to still be on here. Let me just summarize our results this quarter. I thought we\u2019re quite good. Annuity sales continue to be strong. We\u2019re very pleased with the quality of the business that we\u2019re writing. I am also pleased with the progress that we've made with our new SmartCare life product. We now have a network of over 56,000 advisors able to sell that.","As you saw, we made good progress exiting the TSAs and continue to feel good about our ultimate expense reduction plans. Our hedge program continue to perform well, and as we talk throughout the call here, out assets even with the offsets remained $1.5 billion over CTE98. And finally we've prudently managed our capital, and we'll continue to do so in the future. We believe our balance sheet is well protected for a low rate environment. And thank you for your interest in Brighthouse. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"3526":["Brighthouse Financial, Inc.

My name is Brian and I will be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards end of the conference call. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. As a reminder, the conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Also, we ask that you refrain from using cell-phones, speakerphones or headsets during the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to David Rosenbaum, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Rosenbaum you may proceed.","David Rosenbaum","Good morning and thank you for joining Brighthouse Financial's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Our earnings release, presentation and financial supplement were released last night and can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at brighthousefinancial.com. We encourage you to review all of these materials and we will refer to the slide presentation in our prepared remarks.","Today you will hear from Eric Steigerwalt, our President and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Conor Murphy, our Chief Operating Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments we will open the call up for a question-and-answer period. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are John Rosenthal, Chief Investment Officer; Myles Lambert Chief Distribution and Marketing Officer; and Ed Spehar our Incoming Chief Financial Officer.","Our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Brighthouse Financial's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in Brighthouse Financial's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Information discussed on today's call speaks only as of today, August 6, 2019. The company undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed on today's call.","During this call we will be discussing certain financial measures that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles, also known as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures on a historical basis to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related definitions may be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website and our earnings release, slide presentation or financial supplement. And finally, references to statutory results are preliminary due to the timing of the filing of the statutory statements.","And now, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Eric Steigerwalt.","Eric Steigerwalt","Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Brighthouse delivered strong results during the second quarter of 2019. Equity markets were strong and while U.S. interest rates declined, which we will discuss later, we generated additional capital during the quarter. Investment income from alternative investments was higher, as expected, given first quarter market performance.","Claims results improved modestly sequentially, while expenses were higher in the second quarter as expected. Sales remained very strong and we completed the repositioning of our investment portfolio as well. Moving forward, we remain focused on executing our strategy, which we continue to believe will generate long-term shareholder value.","Also, we recently announced the addition of Ed Spehar to the company as our Chief Financial Officer. Ed is with us today and will officially assume the CFO role on August 12. He is a seasoned leader with an in-depth knowledge of our business. I am confident that Ed's addition to our management team will help us continue to execute our strategy and deliver a long-term value to shareholders, partners and customers. I also want to take a moment to thank Conor Murphy for his leadership as the Interim CFO over the last six months.","As we have previously discussed, one of our goals is to be a consistent returner of capital over time and we continue to make progress toward achieving this goal. We repurchased approximately $136 million of our common stock in the second quarter. And we've continued repurchases in the third quarter of 2019 with approximately $43 million of our stock repurchased in July. Since the announcement of our first repurchase authorization in August of 2018, we have repurchased a total of $336 million of our common stock through July 2019.","Now let me turn to second quarter results. Our key highlights for the quarter are summarized on slide three of our earnings presentation. First, I'm very pleased with our outstanding sales results in the second quarter. We had approximately $1.9 billion of annuity sales, up 34% compared to the second quarter of 2018 and up 11% sequentially. We continue to be pleased with our sales growth as well as the quality of new business we are adding each quarter.","In February, we launched our new hybrid life insurance product Brighthouse SmartCare. This launch marked our first life insurance product introduction since becoming an independent public company and is part of our strategy to reestablish a competitive presence in the life insurance market. The early feedback from our distribution partners has been extremely positive. Results are in line with our expectations in the second quarter, but I'm pleased with the very strong sales pipeline, as we move into the third quarter.","We continue to add major distributors for our SmartCare product in the second quarter, and intend to roll out this product to additional distributors throughout the rest of the year.","Second, we are continuing to make necessary investments in our technology infrastructure and in our businesses. We refer to these investments as establishment costs. In the second quarter, establishment costs were approximately $30 million post-tax.","Third, let me touch on our earnings results. Adjusted earnings, less notable items improved sequentially driven by higher investment income, primarily from our alternative investment portfolio given the favorable equity markets in the first quarter of 2019. Equity market performance in the second quarter provided a benefit to adjusted earnings, but to a lesser extent than in the first quarter.","And finally, we continue to prudently manage our variable annuity capitalization. As we have talked about previously, we are managing our VA business to CTE98 or higher. As of the second quarter, our VA assets were approximately $1.5 billion in excess of CTE98 consistent with our strategy. Our hedging program continues to perform well, across a wide range of economic conditions and in line with our expectations.","Before turning the call over to Conor to discuss our second quarter results in more detail, let me provide a few perspectives on interest rates. Brighthouse, like all insurance companies, is impacted by the level of long-term interest rates.","With that said, we believe our balance sheet is well protected for a low rate environment. We have successfully managed our capital markets exposures through the use of derivatives and existing capital on the balance sheet over the last two years.","During the first and second quarters of this year, we proactively added interest rate protection, reducing our sensitivity to changes in long-term interest rates on statutory capital.","The net result of our VA hedging strategy was an increase of assets above CTE98 in the quarter to approximately $1.5 billion, as I said previously. This is yet another example of Brighthouse prudently managing its balance sheet.","Despite the current low interest rate environment, we continue to believe in our ability to achieve our $1.5 billion capital return target by 2021. We believe we have multiple levers to achieve the remainder of our capital return target.","First, as I just discussed, we are prudently managing the capital backing our variable annuity block. Despite the low rate environment, we have generated more than $600 million of normalized statutory earnings given the strong equity market performance in the first half of 2019.","Although Brighthouse Life Insurance Company or BLIC has ordinary dividend capacity in 2019, we are currently planning for regular dividends for the holding company from BLIC to begin in 2020 post the implementation of variable annuity capital reform in our statutory financials.","Second, as we have said previously, our reinsurance subsidiary, Brighthouse Reinsurance Company of Delaware is robustly capitalized. And we believe it is possible that over time excess capital could be released.","Third, we anticipate that New England Life Insurance Company or NELICO will continue to be a stable source of capital for the holding company. NELICO's 2019 ordinary dividend capacity is over $100 million.","We intend to dividend this amount to the holding company later this year. We expect NELICO will continue to generate approximately $60 million to $70 million of dividend capacity per year over the next several years.","And finally, we currently have excess capital at the holding company. As a reminder, our goal is to have liquid assets at the holding company of at least 2 times our annual fixed charges. And as of the second quarter of 2019, we are well in excess of our target.","To wrap up, we had solid results this quarter and we continue to take proactive steps to ensure our balance sheet is well protected for a low interest rate environment. We have made significant progress over the past two years as an independent company.","As we celebrate our second anniversary this week, I want to take a moment to thank all of our employees for their tremendous dedication, focus and hard work over the past two years.","Going forward, we remain focused on continuing to grow life and annuity sales, reducing expenses, effectively managing our capital, and driving long-term shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Conor to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail. Conor?","Conor Murphy","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. We had strong adjusted earnings results in the quarter and continued improvement in key balance sheet metrics as evidenced by the performance of our variable annuity hedging program. Last night, we reported adjusted earnings excluding the impact from notable items of $296 million in the quarter, compared with adjusted earnings on the same basis of $259 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $197 million in the second quarter of 2018.","Overall, investment results were solid the equity markets performed better than our base case, claims improved modestly, and corporate expenses were higher as expected. There were two unfavorable notable items in the quarter: establishment costs of $30 million after-tax impacting Corporate & Other; and $12 million after-tax related to a reinsurance adjustment impacting the Run-off segment.","A few underlying themes influenced our results this quarter. Overall, net investment income increased approximately $100 million after-tax sequentially. The increase was driven primarily by the alternative investment returns, which improved given the positive first quarter market performance. Prepayments were higher as was asset growth, which was primarily driven by our continued strong sales momentum.","I would also like to note through the second quarter of 2019, we have repositioned approximately $8 billion of treasuries into a diversified mix of high-quality spread assets, marking the completion of the repositioning of our investment portfolio. Continuing with the market impact on results, separate account returns were positive 3.8% in the quarter, over two percentage points above our base case assumption.","Compared with the base case, this resulted in a favorable impact of $20 million after tax. While separate account returns were higher than our base case assumption, they were below the first quarter 2019 separate account returns, which resulted in higher DAC amortization on reserves on a sequential basis.","Variable annuity separate account balances ended the quarter at $99 billion modestly higher than at the end of the first quarter of 2019. Higher separate account balances coupled with more processing days resulted in higher fee revenue sequentially.","Moving on to life insurance, claims were modestly favorable compared to the first quarter 2019, primarily as a result of higher reinsurance recoveries in the second quarter. Lastly, our corporate expenses in the second quarter were $242 million, up approximately $17 million pre-tax sequentially consistent with our expectations.","We anticipate full year 2019 corporate expenses to be in line with or slightly below the 2018 full year level as we continue to transition to the Brighthouse operating platform. We are still projecting a $150 million of corporate expense reduction on a run-rate basis by year-end 2020 and an additional $25 million in 2021.","Turning to adjusted earnings at the segment level, which excludes the previously mentioned notable items. Starting with annuities, adjusted earnings in the Annuity segment were $265 million in the quarter. As I mentioned, separate account returns were strong in the quarter and above the base case, which benefited adjusted earnings to a lesser extent than in the first quarter. Alternative investment returns were positive driven by the first quarter 2019 market performance and asset balances increased sequentially aided by our continued strong sales momentum.","Additionally, fee income increased as I previously mentioned. Adjusted earnings in the Life segment were $58 million in the quarter. Sequentially, results were favorably impacted by the increase in alternative investment returns and higher reinsurance recovery. This was partially offset by higher DAC amortization. The Run-off segment reported adjusted earnings of $14 million in the quarter. The sequential increase was driven by higher alternative investment return. Corporate & Other had an adjusted loss of $41 million. Sequentially, expenses were higher driven by the timing of ongoing marketing and branding programs.","To wrap-up, I would like to provide an update on our capital position as of June 30, 2019. With respect to our variable annuity hedging strategy, results were in line with expectations in the quarter and outperformed the sensitivities outlined in our 2018 Form 10-K. As we previously mentioned in the first half of 2019, we proactively added more interest rate protection, reducing the sensitivity of our statutory capital to changes in long-term interest rate.","The net result of our VA hedging strategy was a sequential increase in assets above CTE98 in the second quarter to approximately $1.5 billion despite lower interest rates. Additionally, normalized statutory earnings in the quarter were approximately $280 million bringing our year-to-date total as Eric said to over $600 million. Statutory combined total adjusted capital was approximately $6.9 billion up $600 million from the prior quarter driven by gains from our variable annuity hedging program in the second quarter.","We intend to adopt NAIC VA reform for statutory reporting by year end 2019. We believe the new reserve framework will help pave the way for growth in ordinary dividend capacity in the years to come as we expect changes in reserves will better align with our hedge target.","Finally, our average financial leverage ratio was consistent with the prior quarter at 24% and our holding company liquid assets were approximately $900 million at the end of the second quarter. In all, we had another quarter of solid performance and we continue to prudently manage our balance sheet.","With that, we'd like to turn the call over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. ","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Good morning. My first question. You guys pointed to the increase on interest rate hedges that you guys purchased in the quarter with the subsequent to the end of the second quarter we're seeing the 10-year drop it's now at 1.75, obviously at 2 at the end of the quarter. Could you just give us a sense of the interest rate hedges and their ability to work -- continue to work with the 10-year at the level that it's at today?","Conor Murphy","Hi, Elyse, it's Conor. Yes, so you're correct. We did add a reasonable amount of protection in the first half of the year. At this stage we believe we are well-protected for low rate environment. With respect to the hedging strategy it is designed to protect the statutory balance sheet and we're executing our strategy. But we're mining it up against market conditions as well.","So given the implied interest rate volatility being at historically low levels in the first half of the year, we took some opportunity to increase that protection. So we're feeling pretty good. We believe we're well-protected at this stage. With respect to the impacts from here on a statutory basis, we believe that as of right now that we wouldn't be meaningfully different from where we finished the second quarter.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of the annuities the sales were pretty strong in the quarter. Some other companies have commented given lower interest rates as they had to adjust their pricing on some of their products. So have you guys taken action as well? And would you expect an impact on sales from here or is just -- is there an offset from new distribution arrangements that could help offset potentially any changes on the pricing side of things?","Conor Murphy","Yes. Let me start from my Chief Operating Officer and pricing heart for a second and then I'll give it to Myles. We're not seeing a meaningful impact in terms from a pricing perspective. We do revisit the pricing on all of our annuity and Shield-liked products every two weeks. But not seeing anything meaningful from a pricing point of view. But I'm going to ask Myles to add some commentary from a sales and pipeline perspective.","Myles Lambert","Yes. Thank you, Conor. And as everyone knows the majority of our sales are coming from our Shield product. So we remain very confident that we'll be able to continue sales -- continue to grow sales on that front. So we don't see a significant impact as it relates to our ability to produce sales on a low interest rate environment.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Andrew Kligerman","Hey, good morning. First question is around the hedging instruments that you are using to protect your statutory balance sheet from -- with respect to interest rates. Could you talk about the types of hedges you're buying?","Conor Murphy","Yes. Well, I mean, I think you're probably pretty familiar with the composition that we disclosed. It was about $100 billion of notional in the 10-Ks and 10-Qs. In terms of what changed this quarter is we added more interest rate options. We had about $10 billion of notional at the end of the year. We brought that up to about $17 billion in the first quarter and we brought it up to about $21 billion in the second quarter.","Andrew Kligerman","I see and are they swapped? So they -- are they future oriented? What options -- what in particular, I mean if rates rise are you going to feel the pressure on the opposite direction?","Eric Steigerwalt","Andrew, it's Eric. The composition of the instruments isn't different. I mean swaptions, swaps options we use all of them. In this particular case what we added was interest rate options. And no we feel pretty comfortable if rates go up. But we feel very comfortable if rates stay where they are at now or even go a little lower with respect to the hedging portfolio.","Andrew Kligerman","And Eric, are these options long-term?","Eric Steigerwalt","Longer term, I mean they're certainly not short-dated options. Over the last two years, we've discussed being out duration a little bit they're not 10-year duration. But they're longer than three months.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it. And then over the statutory financials, I saw that you had a net loss of $100 million. And you've mentioned on the call that normalized you should be at $600 million of earnings. So could you clarify what the dynamics there that generated a statutory loss of $100 million?","Eric Steigerwalt","Yeah. So I think the pieces that you're missing are the elements of the standard scenario, which were not terribly significant this quarter changes in the CTE95 and then the unrealized gains and losses on the hedging program. So when you adjust for those that's what's giving you the normalized stat earning number of $280 million.","Andrew Kligerman","I see. And then just lastly what's the deductible standing out right now?","Conor Murphy","Well, so we haven't had any change overall in the deductible since last quarter. So we're, obviously, more meaningfully above the 95. I think the last time we had spoken about it we had a number in the sort of $1.2 billion range by potentially going up to about $1.5 billion. But we haven't changed it in the quarter.","Andrew Kligerman","So $1.2 billion?","Conor Murphy","Correct.","Andrew Kligerman","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Just a follow-up on the change in the interest rate hedging program. Would you expect that this is going to change the long-term distributable cash flows at the block? So I guess what I'm getting at is what's -- is there a cost associated with the extra protection you put on when you think about counting your from long-term economics?","Conor Murphy","No, Tom. I would \u2013 well, I've mentioned we did add and actually to some extent extended maturities here. There's no meaningful change in terms of the overall cost. So you got to put this in the context of the $100 billion of notional.","Eric Steigerwalt","Hey Tom, it's Eric. I might just add this. I don't really think it's a change in the hedging program. We -- we're opportunistic. I'm sure other companies are opportunistic as well. VA was pretty low in the first quarter. It's not like there's any wholesale change to the program. The program is very well established. It has parameters around its strategy. And we found a way to increase protection and frankly even duration a little bit. So I just want to say that for everybody, I don't consider a wholesale change in the program itself.","Conor Murphy","And let me just start again as a reminder and part of what drove the opportunity here was that the implied volatility is at historically low level. So that gives us a chance to -- well we saw attractive pricing for interest rate options in the first half of the year as well.","Tom Gallagher","Thanks. And then my follow-up is Eric, you sound confident that you can still extract some of the excess capital out of the SGUL captive. What -- is there anything you can give us could you mention how much excess you think might be there? And what would the process be when -- and from a timing standpoint when would you think you could begin to extract the capital?","Eric Steigerwalt","Yeah Tom. Look this all revolves around conversations with our regulators. We have a very good relationship with them, we want to keep a very good relationship with them. We feel we're managing the company very prudently. I can't put words in their mouth but I do think that they pay attention to what we're doing and I hope they think we're doing a pretty good job. I can't dimension either the size or the timing because it all depends on these conversations. So over time we will be discussing the capital position in BRCD and what we think of as excess capital and, obviously, they have to agree. So while I believe over time, we absolutely will be able to extract some capital there I can't dimension it yet. And as soon as I can I'll be happy to do so.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. And then just a quick follow-up on that. The current interest rate environment would not persuade you from believing your still material excess capital there?","Eric Steigerwalt","All right. I've been persuaded to spend a lot of time on the definition of the word current over the last 24 hours. So let me be very explicit here. Currently the 10 year's in the 175 area, okay? If we see some of the volatility that we've seen in terms over time here, i.e. rates go back up to some degree, probably not a lot but to some degree. Then I feel like we have the capability in our normal operating environments and some extra levers to be able to hit the $1.5 billion of capital returns.","Now if you tell me that if we look at the current interest rate environment and it's going to be like this for three years then I would say that there's some headwinds there. And we'd have to take that into consideration, if we were going to make a call on that assumption.","And I think you all know that, because we published these scenarios, they're in the last 10-K. So you all have a pretty good sense of longer-term there.","So I hope I was clear there. If we see volatility in rates, by the way if equity markets continue to do well and I don't mean like the last couple of days. You know what I'm talking about here. Then again, I feel pretty comfortable. But a longer-term rates were lower for a number of years. That will put some headwinds. Again, I know that's no surprise. I hope that was helpful.","Tom Gallagher","That was. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Erik Bass of Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. Just first one follow-up may be along that vein is -- how should we think about any changes to the previously provided interest rate sensitivities that you've given both for capital and cash flow?","Conor Murphy","So, Erik again, just maybe I don't -- let me get totally redundant or repetitive to Eric's part from -- we have our year-end disclosures for both distributable earnings and cash flows. The cash flows are not as impacted and those are 50-year scenario. So if you were to compare those today with where we're at the end of the year, they're similar and probably modestly better.","In terms of the distributable earnings, then it gets back to what you think from an equity market perspective, part of the drivers, the equity market and part of it is interest rate. So as Eric said, the equity markets are okay, and the interest rates stay where they are not for the next few years, then it's going to be a lower number. If both of them were lower then your -- you know what that looks like, because we gave you that scenario in the 10-K.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thanks. And then can you provide any sensitivity to the net income impact if you were to make any changes to your, I think, 4.25% long-term interest rate assumption, just kind of thinking ahead to the third quarter review?","Ed Spehar","Hi, Erik, it's Ed. So as you know our actual rate assumption update is done once a year in the third quarter. And so we will discuss it on next quarter's call. But let me provide a little bit perspective on the interest rate assumptions. So, on a GAAP basis, we have a mean reversion rate of 4.25% for the 10-year.","On a stack basis, which is how we run the company the implied interest rate assumptions are lower. So first, under VA reform, there's a prescribed methodology for interest rates based on a weighted average of historical data. So, as a result, our CTE calculation includes an implied mean reversion rate of 3.25% for the 10-year.","Second, we're required to perform cash flow testing for stack reserves on an annual basis and this exercise includes a variety of interest rates stress scenarios. At year-end 2018, we had have meaningful cash flow testing margins. And at current rates, we believe we continue to have meaningful margins.","So it's fair to say that changing the GAAP mean reversion rate assumption would have no bearing on our CTE calc or our stat balance sheet. So, just to give you a sense of the difference between interest rate assumptions on a GAAP and stack basis. Hope that helps.","Erik Bass","Got it. And then on that GAAP basis, it's obviously non-cash and accounting-oriented. Is there any kind of sizing you can give at this point, or just wait until third quarter?","Ed Spehar","Yeah. I think you're going to have to wait until the third quarter.","Erik Bass","Okay. Thanks.","Ed Spehar","Actually, no. This is an involved process. So stay tuned.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of John Nadel with UBS. Your line is now open.","John Nadel","Hey, good morning, everybody. Just coming back to the incremental hedging that you guys have put on impressions or not obviously beneficial in the first half of the year maybe late 2018 into the first half of the year. I know Eric that you're describing it as sort of as no real change in your overall hedge approach, but I'm curious how have you guys actually not done what you did? All else equal what would that $1.5 billion relative to CTE98 look like as of 2Q? Because it seems to me that that incremental action has been very beneficial.","Conor Murphy","Hi, John. It's Conor. Yeah, fair question. Had we not put on the additional protection the CTE numbers would have been consistent with first quarter. They would have been pretty flat. So you would not have seen the increase and the increase from -- the increase looks like a $400 million. It's probably closer to $300 million in terms of the rounding.","John Nadel","Okay.","Conor Murphy","So it would have been pretty flat had we not added the extra protection.","John Nadel","Okay. That's helpful. And then I think -- I want to try to paraphrase this, but maybe you can tell me if I've got it right or wrong. The incremental actions and where you guys think your expectation is that it doesn't really have a meaningful impact on distributable cash books?","Conor Murphy","Yes. Are you talking about the protection, or you talking about the cost?","John Nadel","Just net. Does it put you in a better position on a statutory basis for dividend potential to the holding company or does it not materially change your potential dividend activity as we look out the next year or two?","Conor Murphy","I don't think it's material. Look and again, we're going to be able to revisit those at the end of the year with the full adoption or the full implementation of VA reform that's going to the more meaningful I don't think this is terribly meaningful to that.","John Nadel","Got you okay. And then just one more question on investment income so -- I'm not sure if alternatives includes prepayments and make-wholes, I just wonder if you could just help us understand may be relative to the total $942 million of investment income this quarter at 2Q, how much of that on an underlying basis would you consider sort of a normalized level of NII?","John Rosenthal","Hi, it's John.","John Nadel","Hi John.","John Rosenthal","So, I think we break alternatives in prepayments into two buckets. As you know the alternative return for the quarter was 4.1%, $76 million on a base of about $1.8 billion, returns from alternatives are hard to predict year-to-year much less quarter-to-quarter as these quarterly returns are real woeful. It's a long-term asset class for this and as we talk about in the past.","But as we disclosed in our presentation we expect a 9% to 11% long-term return from alts and again, that's long-term. So, you can feel free to use those numbers to derive what a normal quarter might look like, but just please keep in mind that there is pretty much no such thing as a normal quarter for alts.","On the prepayment side, we -- prepayments were elevated during the quarter, primarily due to one mortgage prepayment, one bond prepayment. You could -- I'm not sure whether we give that as a separate prepayment number, but you can take off $10 million to $15 million pretax to get a more normalized number from prepayment.","John Nadel","Okay. Okay so at quarterly NII that's in the high $800 million, may be bordering on $900 million seems to be about right?","John Rosenthal","I think that's a pretty good guess.","John Nadel","Okay. And that's inclusive of all the benefits of the full repositioning, correct?","John Rosenthal","Yes it is.","John Nadel","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. First just on your annuity sales. Obviously, the Shield product is helping you grow, you've added distribution as well. I just wanted to get an idea on of all the distributors or the major ones that you've added over the past year like Chase, Primerica, are you fully benefited, or there is more to go in terms of you getting sort of what you believe is your fair share through some of those distribution outlets?","Myles Lambert","It's Myles. Thank you for the question. No, we feel like there's still a lot of room for growth as it relates to some of the new distributors that we brought on selling our flagship product. But in addition to that we continue to grow distribution to expand into other firms and new channels.","And then lastly what I would say is that the firms that we've been working with over the past several years that are selling Shield, we've seen them continue to grow their business there. So, we feel like there's still a lot of runway as it relates to growing our Shield sales moving forward.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then on the reinsurance cost adjustment do you expect an impact on your ongoing earnings from that as well? And if yes, how much is it if you can quantify?","Conor Murphy","Hi, it's Conor. No, that is a one-time reflection. There's not an ongoing impact in future quarters.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is now open.","Ryan Krueger","Hi thanks, good morning. On the life reinsurance captive when you did the separation, you had purchased a pretty large amount of interest rates hedges for the stack capital back in that. Do you still maintain all of those rate hedges? So, should we think about lower rates, I guess, it's not materially impacting your view of access capital on the reinsurance captive?","Conor Murphy","Yes, the simple answer is yes. We keep -- we maintain our protection on that as well from an interest rate perspective.","Ryan Krueger","Got it. And then I guess on NAIC VA reform, I think you've already incorporated -- I guess I believe you've incorporated most of the impacts already in terms of when you discuss your capital in excess of CTE98. But I just wanted to I guess confirm that would you expect much additional change when you fully adopt this at the end of this year or do you generally capture the impact already?","Conor Murphy","Not with respect to the CTE calculation.","Ryan Krueger","So, just the RBC calculation?","Conor Murphy","Well, that will be a -- yes. So, there will be -- yes, there are elements for the transition that are not complete. But in terms of how we calibrate the CTEs, those already incorporate the impacts of VA reform.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is now open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to try to reconcile a few things, if I could. On the one hand, you seem pretty confident in your ability to get dividends out of BLIC by 2020. But then, on the other hand, if we look at your 10-K disclosures, the distributable earnings out of the VA business are pretty sensitive to rates. And if we look at that scenario for in particular, it shows a pretty big drop-off in the level of distributable earnings. I'm just trying to reconcile those few things and understand if we're in this low rate environment, what gives you the confidence that you can get dividends out of BLIC?","Conor Murphy","Well let me start. I see you mentioned the differences between sort of scenario one and four. And you're right, it's a meaningful difference because in scenario four, there is a little to no distributable earnings. But remember, the difference between those two scenarios is a combination of both interest rates and equity market returns. And they're both meaningful the equity market might actually be a little bigger than the interest rate element. So, again I think back to what Eric had said earlier, if you're isolating the interest rate from the equity market component, yes that will be a challenge. If you're saying both that we have the low equity markets and prolonged low interest rates then, yes the ability to -- well that'll be an additional challenge to the ability to take those out over the next few years.","Now again remember we're $600 million in already. We've executed over $300 million of that. I think we've got $264 million to go after the end of July. We also have $600 million of start earnings in the first six months of this year. So again depending on when you're starting point is, if you're starting today, I think you'll have to count that into your distributable earnings calculation as well. And we've made reference to some of the other drivers that we have as well.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just one quick one on the captive, I know it's still very much tied to conversations with the regulators. But I believe on last quarter's call, you talked about having those conversations this summer. Any color on whether you've had them and if there's been any initial feedback from the regulators to the extent you can comment?","Eric Steigerwalt","Yes. Suneet, it's Eric. Yes, we have had some conversations and we've got plenty more to go. This stuff never revolves around one conversation nor should it frankly. These are ongoing conversations that we have with our regulators. And that'll continue to go on for as long as they need to. We want them to understand exactly what we're doing; understand how we're prudently managing the company et cetera. So, I'd love to be able to give you a play-by-play here, but it really just doesn't work that way. This will unfold over time. I do believe that we have excess capital there. And as these conversations unfold to the point where I can truly talk about it on a call like this I definitely will.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","John Barnidge","Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. But on the tax rate, it's danced around a bit, I get there is some level of volatility quarter-to-quarter. But what are your current thoughts on a full year tax rate range?","Eric Steigerwalt","You should expect it'll be in the mid-teens.","John Barnidge","Okay. And then given the volatility of the markets on the equity and interest rate side, how the conversations on an annuity sale change this year versus last year because not only has Shield sold well this year, but so have fixed indexed annuities. Thanks for the answers.","Ed Spehar","Can you clarify that question again a little bit?","John Barnidge","Sure. How has the conversation on a sales perspective changed this year versus last year given the volatility in the market both on the equity side and the interest rate side for your products in the Annuities segment? I ask this in light of Shield having sold well, but also fixed indexed annuities having sold well this year.","Ed Spehar","Yes. So on the Shield side; I think this type of market volatility on a short-term perspective could slightly impact sales. But to your point on a longer-term perspective, as clients look for more protection, but yet still remain invested in equity market is actually a good thing for our Shield product. As it relates to what we're seeing with FIA sales, I think it's a similar story. I think for those clients and advisers that are looking to provide maximum protection even though cap rates might come down a little bit from an interest-rate standpoint, it's still providing that type of guarantee that customers are looking for, so that they can stay invested in the market with fully protected products.","Eric Steigerwalt","John, it's Eric. I'll just add something too. On the pure fixed side, look, obviously if we're seeing any pressure on pricing, it's going to be there. And we got to prudently manage our returns, but people are still looking for guarantees. So that's why I think not only here, but at other companies, you're seeing fixed annuity sales doing okay. We'll have to see what happens here, where rates go next. But -- I thought I'd just clarify that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alex Scott","Hey, good morning. I have a follow-up also on the hedged program. So, when I look at the disclosure you guys provide on the movement in your derivatives quarter-over-quarter, spent $800 million. And I think through some of the product sensitivity that you guys have provided around the way, the CTE requirements move. I guess it's -- it was a bit surprising that there is that big of an offset in the liabilities didn't move as much.","So I'm wondering, is it the equity exposure that's driving some of this. Have you -- are the options that you have so far out of the money that now if equity markets move up there's just not much of a drag from the marks on the equities? And does that change your sensitivity going forward?","Eric Steigerwalt","Alex, let me start. It's Eric. We've had this conversation a couple of times on these calls. It's a big portfolio, right? You got to understand the movements and liabilities. You got to understand the movements on the asset side, volatility changes frankly stat changes. It's pretty hard from the outside to perfectly predict where this is going. And I said previously, I don't consider what we did in the first and second quarter, a big change. I consider generally that we had a strategy as we spun off the company. And we've been following that strategy.","Now it's shades of gray on the margin from time to time and everybody does that. This is a particularly interesting time for us. I know John and I -- that'll cause oppression. But look we were looking at volatility. We are constantly watching the markets et cetera. And I think we've got a reasonable handle on our liability calculations as well. So we're managing the hedge portfolio all the time.","Not necessarily trading all the time, certainly but managing it all the time. So I think maybe a couple of quarters ago I was like, it would be hard for anybody on the outside to sort of get within better than $300 million-ish, okay? So I know you're trying to get it right down to the penny, but that's not the easiest thing to do. Conor, I'll turn it over to you. I know you want to add something.","Conor Murphy","Well actually I think you've -- you really captured it. What I was going to say is, again I appreciate that you're a very detailed analyst and you've gone through the portfolio in great detail, but in order to be -- to do this calculation completely as Eric said, you need not just the components of the hedges, but the liability changes as well. And your elements of yes time decay and basis risk and fees and everything else. So to Eric's point, you're going to be able to get a reasonable assumption, but you won't be able to do it as fine-tuned as I think you'd like to.","Eric Steigerwalt","And maybe I'll just add this as well. Our goal with the hedging program is to protect the stat balance sheet. And now I think tomorrow is our two-year anniversary, I have no issues with all of you wanting to understand. Do you really have a handle on this hedging portfolio and this hedging strategy. And I do believe it's starting to unfold that we do. We know what we're doing here. I feel really good about the strategy. There's not been wholesale changes in the strategy. Again, at the margin we do some things, but I feel really good about our ability to protect the stat balance sheet and that is the ultimate goal of the hedging program. I hope those comments were helpful.","Alex Scott","Yes. Those comments were very helpful. One more follow-up on that. I guess just around the options that I think if 1Q hedged balances were still intact the options associated with equities were like 40% to 50% out of the money now. So have you taken the opportunity to pull any of those? And further -- and I'm not talking about small changes, but I think that was like the need of this equity options was very far out of the money. So just interested if those were pulled in or not?","Eric Steigerwalt","So in retrospect, as you can eventually find out where these positions are you'll be able to take a look at what we're doing, but I don't want to comment on like what we're doing right this minute. Conor, you want to add anything?","Conor Murphy","I think yes, I would agree with Eric. And look you'll get the queue in due course and you'll get the schedule BAs. But the -- I would say broadly speaking we talked about a pretty meaningful increase in our interest rate option protection across the other elements of the portfolio it's not meaningfully different including the equity option.","Alex Scott","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Your line is now open.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on your comment about the hedged program. I understand it's going to be dynamic and you would be optimistic in terms of fine-tuning your protection. I guess like based on your earlier comment, it sounded like you're planning anything incremental at least right now. But what could trigger some further fine-tuning and if so what are some of those potential actions would be?","Eric Steigerwalt","Well I love your fine-tuning. That's a good phrase Humphrey. Because that's what it is it's fine-tuning. Just watching as we see liability changes, watching the markets every day, but again I would consider it more fine-tuning. And when you do that you get secondary order affects like you might change duration a little bit to the positive, right? A little longer duration. So I don't see anything right now that would have us do anything but I do like your phrase fine-tuning because that's how we think about it.","Humphrey Lee","I'm glide you liked that. So I'm shifting gear. For one-off I know the segment is going to be volatile quarter-over-quarter -- at any given quarters. But I still think you've said to that kind of $15 million based on expectations for a number of quarters now. It was the third quarter we were just coming up. Could that be any kind of potential area of concern as you're kind of looking through the \u2013 your book?","Eric Steigerwalt","Okay. Well, and just to reiterate or to underscore that range if you will is X notable items. I think \u2013 look it is nothing materially different. I think we'll have an opportunity with our Investor Outlook Call later in the year perhaps to revisit the run rates. This is \u2013 it's a small amount. I think we talk about it currently in the $10 million to $15 million range. And it doesn't take a lot to move that number very much. But broadly speaking, I think the run rates are largely intact and we'll revisit them at the end of the year and let you know if they need to be treated.","Humphrey Lee","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Joshua Shanker","Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. We have a lot of good information even some more data on sensitivities. And we're always getting more, but the one area that we don't have great detail on is volatility. The VIX yesterday went up to 25 from 15 at the beginning of the quarter. Can you update us a little bit on how should we think about equity markets of all? And also you never really talk about that what are the sensitivities to earnings and capital from interest rates falls?","Conor Murphy","Hey, it's Connor. Okay. So look it's hard. I \u2013 the VIX is probably not the best determinator, if you will for the vol calculation for us. I \u2013 yeah, it's meaningful and higher volatility is generally a positive for us. I will say in Q2, specifically vol was really not a factor it was a very benign second quarter but \u2013 ","Joshua Shanker","No, I'm asking about third quarter of course.","Conor Murphy","Yeah. Look there's going to be a lot of \u2013 we have a long way to go in the third quarter. So I'm going to stay away from any predictions on where that may collide other than what I said previously that, in terms of interest rates we would be broadly speaking where we finished the second quarter currently.","Eric Steigerwalt","But Joshua, it's Eric. It could help. I mean, you obviously know that. But yeah, I mean from the point of view of early August it's pointless to speculate where it'll be at the end of the quarter.","Joshua Shanker","I read it this morning, I'm actually not looking for speculating, but I'm looking for is there a rule of thumb that we can sort of think about this or are you going to point to help us to frame it?","Eric Steigerwalt","Not really. I mean, you know higher is good that you definitely know. And I'm not trying to be a smart guy here. But these calculations are pretty complicated. The overall hedging strategy isn't really that complicated, but the calculations are so. So it's not perfectly linear. So I don't want to give out some rule of thumb here. Higher is better and you all know that. So I'll leave it at that.","Joshua Shanker","And interest rate fall is there a big impact? How should we think about that?","Eric Steigerwalt","Less than equity. Interest rate vol would be \u2013 would have an effect less than equities.","Joshua Shanker","Is a positive \u2013 is this higher vol positive or negative in interest rate for the calculations?","Eric Steigerwalt","Similar.","Joshua Shanker","Similar, higher vol better, okay.","Eric Steigerwalt","You're getting there. Anything else, Joshua?","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, I would now turn the call back over to Mr. Steigerwalt for closing remarks.","Eric Steigerwalt","Thanks. While everybody is still on here, I just thought maybe I'd spend two minutes here on just to wrap-up on where we're on our sort of second anniversary. Look, we all know low interest rates pose a challenge to the industry and we have talked about that a lot today. Over the last two years, we've prudently managed our capital and we'll continue to do so in the future. And we believe our balance sheet is well protected for a low rate environment as we've discussed on a large part of this call.","We began returning capital to shareholders almost two years ahead of our plan and have continued repurchasing stock even as interest rates have declined. Also, we're maintaining our capital return target of $1.5 billion by year-end 2021, because at this time as we've discussed again on this call, we're not assuming rates will stay at the current level for an extended period although they could and then we'll have a different conversation.","We do have other levers that we could and can pull to offset some of the low pressure from interest rates. And obviously we would also have to talk about where equity markets are as well.","Let me just say a few more things. Look, I couldn't be more pleased with our annuity sales. They continue to be robust. A couple of you asked Myles some questions today. And I think you can sense that he still feels very good about our prospects going forward here.","In addition, let's remember that our Shield product has a meaningful risk offset to our enforce block of variable annuities. So, it was designed that way years ago and it is working as advertised. We're also re-establishing our presence in the life insurance space. So, I'm really excited about the momentum going into the third quarter here.","We made good progress exiting the TSAs, and I'll tell you we feel really good about our expense reduction plans. I do want to say this, my guess is that our one-time establishment costs will be a little higher. So, we'll get into that probably in the third quarter, certainly on an investor call. Maybe that's one spot, it's probably going to take a little longer and cost a little more. And I think it'll be important for you all to know that.","With respect to the investment portfolio, we're now fully transitioned to our multi-manager strategy, and the cost savings that are associated with that. We've also repositioned approximately $8 billion of treasuries into a diversified mix of high-quality spread assets.","So, I feel good about that John's looking at me right now. We've almost fully transitioned to the multi-manager strategy. We've talked about the hedging program a lot today. I hope all of you are starting to get the feeling that this strategy is working and that we are managing it well through various economic cycles.","And finally, I'll just say we remain committed to executing on our strategies. So, we laid out a strategy, and we have -- I don't know, 8-ish targets out there. And it's our goal to hit as many of those as we possibly can, no matter what the economic conditions, but we'll always be transparent with respect to what the economic conditions ramifications are on that strategy.","So, thank you all for paying attention over the last two years, and thanks for being on board today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program, and we may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day."]}}
