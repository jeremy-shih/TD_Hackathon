If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. The presentation material and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations website.","In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 3 hours after the conclusion of this call over the Internet. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com\/investor. [Operator Instructions] ","I would now like introduce Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Dunlap, please go ahead.","Shep Dunlap","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our conference call to present Motorola Solutions' first quarter results. With me this morning are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Ed Fitzpatrick, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mark Moon, Executive Vice President, Sales and Field Operations. Greg and Ed will review our first quarter results, along with commentary, and Mark will join us for Q&A.","We have posted our earnings presentation and press release at motorolasolutions.com\/investor. These materials also include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. As always, I encourage you to review these materials.","A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation. Forward-looking statements are any statements that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of Motorola Solutions, and we can give no assurance that any future results or events discussed in these statements will be achieved.","Any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements contained in this presentation.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown","Thanks, Shep. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Q1 highlighted another record quarter for Motorola Solutions as we achieved strong sales growth, improved operating leverage and returned significant capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and quarterly dividend.","The most recent quarter included a number of significant product and solution launches that continue to demonstrate our unwavering commitment to deliver the best mission-critical solutions to our public safety and enterprise customers.","This morning, we reported record first quarter sales of $2 billion, an increase of 7% from Q1 of last year. On a GAAP basis, net earnings were $0.50 per share from continuing operations compared to $1.07 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations were $0.59 per share compared to $0.54 per share in Q1 of last year, a 9% increase. And for the remainder of the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise noted.","Our Government business revenues increased 11%. North America, Asian and Latin America all experienced double-digit growth, but we were also pleased to see growth in the EMEA. Operating margins in the Government business improved 260 basis points year-over-year, due to strong sales growth across our portfolio and another quarter of disciplined cost management.","In our Enterprise business, sales declined 2% from the year-ago quarter, including an anticipated iDEN decline of $31 million. Growth in this business excluding iDEN was 3%. This increase was a result of growth across our portfolio as customers continued to select our solutions.","Regionally, both North America and Asia had strong results, while EMEA was down slightly, as we expected, in comparison to an extraordinarily strong Q1 of 2011.","On the capital allocation front, we continue to make significant progress in our initiatives and path to net debt that we spoke about at our financial Analyst Meeting last month. During Q1, we paid $70 million in dividends and repurchased $1.4 billion in MSI stock, bringing the total repurchase amount to approximately $2.5 billion since the program was announced in July of last year.","I'll now turn it over to Ed Fitzpatrick to discuss our financial results in more detail. I'll then return to discuss operational highlights and provide additional commentary and perspective on our overall business performance.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Thanks, Greg. Q1 was another quarter of strong growth in operating leverage. Along with revenue growth of 7%, our disciplined expense management yielded an increase of operating earnings of 9% despite a $13 million increase in U.S. pension expense. ","We saw broad-based revenue growth in our Government business, with record first quarter sales of $1.3 billion, an increase of 11% in the prior year. Operating margin in the Government business improved 260 basis points, driven mainly by sales growth and continued leverage.","The Enterprise business declined 2% to $655 million, driven by an anticipated iDEN decline of approximately $31 million. Excluding iDEN, Enterprise posted growth of 3% as a result of growth across the broader portfolio. Operating margin in the Enterprise business declined 360 basis points. The decline was primarily attributable to iDEN. Increased pension and foreign currency expenses also impacted operating margins.","While on the topic of sales, I wanted to make a brief mention of our backlog. In order to provide a more comprehensive view of backlog and to provide a metric that is more consistent with industry standards, we've changed our reporting methodology. Previously, our backlog calculation excluded certain services-related contracts and backlog expected to shift beyond 18 months. We're now adding these items to our backlog figure as it is more reflective of our visibility.","Under this new methodology, our quarter-ending backlog was $6 billion, which compares to $5.3 billion in Q4 of 2011. The sequential increase in backlog is due to the previously announced award of the public safety network in Norway. ","Turning to earnings. Earnings from continued operations were $0.59 per share compared to $0.54 per share a year ago, a 9% increase. Operating expenses were $689 million or 35.2% of revenue, which represents a 100-basis-point improvement from the year-ago quarter. Our operating earnings for the first quarter were $290 million or 14.8% of sales compared to $266 million or 14.5% in Q1 2011. This increase was a result of our continued work to balance critical investments in the business with the content focus on operating leverage. And as I mentioned previously, our first quarter results include a $30 million increase in U.S. pension expense from Q1 of the prior year.","Total other income and expense was a net expense of $4 million in the quarter compared to net income of $3 million in Q1 2011. The prior-year quarter benefited from investment gains in excess of interest expense.  In future quarters, we expect this item to be a net expense of approximately $15 million to $20 million. ","Our effective tax rate was 34% for the quarter. For the remainder of 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 35%. Cash flow from operations was $69 million during the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Q1 2012 includes approximately $150 million in certain annual incentive payouts. In the prior year, all incentive payouts occurred in the second quarter. In addition, we paid $50 million related to our previously announced legal settlement. ","With respect to working capital, I am pleased with our results in inventory management as our turns were 8.3 compared to 7 in the year-ago quarter. Our receivable balance declined, as expected, from Q4. In the second quarter, we anticipate liquidating certain notes receivable related to the Networks business we sold last year. These receivables were reclassified to short-term accounts receivable from long-term other assets last quarter. ","We ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in cash and investments and $1.5 billion in debt. As Greg mentioned earlier, and as we addressed at our Financial Analyst Meeting last month, we purchased $1.4 billion in stock during the quarter, which brings us to approximately $2.5 billion in share repurchases since the inception of our plan.","We've reduced our share count by approximately 16% since the start of the program with a purchase of 54.6 million shares at an average price of $45.38. In addition, we paid $70 million in dividends during the quarter. ","Now turning to our Q2 and full year outlook. For Q2, we expect sales growth of approximately 6% over the second quarter of 2011. Our outlook is for non-GAAP \tearnings per share of $0.65 to $0.70 from continuing operations. This compares to non-GAAP EPS in Q2 2011 of approximately $0.54 per share. Consistent with prior quarters, this outlook excludes stock-based compensation and intangible amortization expenses of approximately $0.10 per share and items historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings releases.","Moving to full year 2012, we are reiterating our sales outlook of approximately 5% growth and operating margins of approximately 17% of revenue. I'll now turn it over to Greg for business highlights from the quarter.","Gregory Q. Brown","Ed, thanks. In our Government business, sales for the quarter were $1.3 billion, which is up 11% over Q1 of last year. We saw solid growth in all regions, including significant growth in North America. Our profitability also improved, with operating earnings growing to 14.1% of sales this quarter compared to 11.5% in Q1 last year as the business continues to scale.","Some notable wins among our ASTRO P25 radio platform included projects in Pierce County, Washington and Adams County, Pennsylvania valued at $18 million and $19 million, respectively. We also announced a $12 million county-wide system to support all Sumter County, Florida public safety and public service agencies. We announced a $7 million system in Colombia County, Georgia that includes our latest ASTRO P25 Base 2 system yet maintains backward compatibility to the legacy networks. And in Warren County, Ohio, we replaced their 22-year-old system with a new $9 million ASTRO 25 emergency communications network for public safety and public service users across the county. ","Internationally, the Ecuador police will deploy $10 million of additional ASTRO radios to increase the current installed base with our APEX series. ","In TETRA, the International TETRA Awards recognized one of our ultra-rugged radios for its design and use in hazardous environments. In addition, our customers were recognized for their adoption of TETRA technology, including Best Use of TETRA in Public Safety for Airwave in the U.K. and Best TETRA Innovation for the Hong Kong Police.","During the quarter, we also won additional TETRA awards with Hong Kong Mass Transit and the Mumbai, India Airport. Growth also continued in our professional and commercial radio portfolio with solid double-digit growth on top of an excellent first quarter last year as customers continue to choose our digital solutions like MOTOTRBO.","This year's International Wireless Communications Expo in Las Vegas provided an opportunity for us to share our latest government solutions and innovation. We announced the MOTOTRBO SL Series, two-way radio, an industry-leading, incredibly thin and light digital radio with its slim form factor, designed to meet user requirements and solutions for hospitality, services, security and airports.","With innovative features such as integrated intelligent audio and intuitive work order ticket management, this device enhances professionalism and discretion while enabling improved customer service and faster response times.","We also introduced the LEX 700, the first handheld Public Safety LTE device, which delivers street-ready data over Public Safety LTE. This mission-critical handheld delivers a compact, rugged form factor with intuitive user interface in unprecedented access to multimedia applications over multiple networks, including Public Safety LTE. We've talked about how important this technology is for public safety and first responders in the U.S. ","We recently were awarded a $4 million contract from Harris County, Texas to expand their Public Safety LTE network with additional sites, to deliver enhanced video and data capabilities along with expanded interoperability with their existing ASTRO 25 radio system.","And in February, President Obama signed the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act, which reallocated the D Block for public safety use. In addition, the law provides a funding stream over the next 8 to 10 years at $7 billion for a nationwide network buildout. We believe we're well positioned to compete for this business in Public Safety LTE.","The products and solutions developed in our Enterprise segment often appeal to our Government customers as well. For example, the Colombia National Police purchased over 2,000 ES400s for their police force as a supplemental device to connect with local citizens. ","Moving on to the Enterprise business, sales in the Enterprise segment were $655 million, a 2% decrease from Q1 of last year. Excluding the expected iDEN decline of $31 million, actually Enterprise grew 3%. Remember also, this comes off of an 18% growth rate in the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings were 16.2% of sales compared to 19.8% last year, with the difference in decline primarily driven by iDEN, pension expense and foreign exchange.","At the National Retail Federation Convention in January, we showcased a number of examples of our leadership and innovation. Together with our partners, we demonstrated how technology continues to change the retail landscape from the warehouse to the store floor. ","Our Retail customers continue to invest in solutions to improve their customers shopping experience. Demand for this technology comes from all segments of the retail value chain, including designers, distributors and retail points of presence with online or traditional stores.","For example, Macy's recently chose our MC3190 and our wireless LAN infrastructure with air defense to drive real-time inventory accuracy within their operations. In another example of our purpose-built enterprise mobile computing portfolio, United Airlines has initially deployed over 3,000 MC95s for baggage handling, accurately tracking bags as they move throughout their North American network, providing greater visibility and improved customer service.","And TNT Express in Germany is deploying new proof-of-delivery applications at our MC95 enterprise mobile computing devices as well. In our advanced data capture business, we unveiled the rugged DS3500 extended range scanners with the flexibility to capture bar code information from extended distances for warehouse management and other harsh industrial environments. Goya Foods recently chose these extended-range scanners because of their ability to scan both 1D and 2D bar codes. And furthermore, Goya expects to improve efficiency with the flexibility of a single device that meets all of their scanning requirements.","Our go-to-market remains focused on a combination of our 1,700 direct sales professionals and our 20,000-plus channel partners, who help us meet customer needs and extend our reach. Our PartnerEmpower channel program was recently awarded with a top rating from CRN magazine, again recognizing the support and investment we provide to distributors, resellers and applications developers.","Our global services team continues to respond to customer demand for more managed services. This quarter, we finalized the transaction to assume responsibility for Norway's nationwide TETRA public safety system, representing a $750 million contract through 2026, one of our largest public safety agreements. Our services team continues to help public safety and public service agencies adopt innovative technologies like video surveillance as well. For example, the city of Chicago video surveillance program continues to expand in Chicago and with additional agencies, such as Chicago public schools, where the program includes -- now includes 14 high schools to keep students safe. In addition, we recently partnered with the city of Cleveland to integrate their Cleveland shared security surveillance network for public safety.","Now turning to a regional view for the total company. For the quarter, North America sales grew 9%, driven by solid growth in both Government and Enterprise. EMEA grew 1% with growth in Government. Asia posted 14% growth, while Latin America decreased 5% as a result of the planned decline in iDEN, which disproportionately affected the region.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please instruct our callers on how to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the site of Jeff Kvaal with Barclays.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was inquiring about the growth rate for the full year. I think it has been not uncommon for you to be listing your growth rates in these quarterly calls. I think not this time, of course. Can we continue to expect the 2011 growth rates to apply for each region through 2012? Or has that have been reason to inject some caution into that view? And then my follow-up is, it sounds as though the -- some third-party data sees some share loss in wireless LAN, and we're wondering what we can think about that.","Gregory Q. Brown","So Jeff, I mean, our Q1 results were very good. We're only 90 days into the year, and we're mindful of some of the continued extenuating circumstances, particularly in Europe. That said, again, we had a great Q1. Government was a little stronger. Enterprise was -- is returning to more normal levels off of very high comps last year. And we're just mindful of the European situation. That said, I think we're more confident in our full year outlook than we were a quarter ago. And we'll continue to evaluate and update accordingly. In terms of WLAN, I think it's too early to get all the results in for Q1, just because of the fact it's recently completed. Typically, we have grown. WLAN's been great, and it has tracked generally in line with the overall market expansion. We do particularly well in our target verticals of retail and transportation logistics. But overall, it was solid in Q1.","Operator","Our next question comes from the site of Craig Hettenbach with Goldman Sachs.","Alkesh Shah - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","If I could just follow up on the comments on Enterprise in Europe. Can you talk about what you're seeing in other geographies and if growth in those other geographies, you think, will be enough to sustain growth or Europe will be a bigger drag?","Gregory Q. Brown","So Craig, remember overall kind of as we take a full year view, we always thought that Government would be in low to mid-single-digits. We thought Enterprise would be higher single-digits. And Europe was soft, to your point, but outside of Enterprise in Europe, if you look at Enterprise in the other regions, we had solid growth. So it was pretty specific to Europe. And that said, backlog was up sequentially. So we'll see how things unfold going forward. But overall, a pretty good balanced quarter.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and as -- on my follow-up, just anything you could point to in the Government business. I mean, that continues to track above expectations, whether it's your view of market share gains, new product refreshes or what else? Can you give a little more detail about what's driving the stronger-than-expected growth in Government?","Gregory Q. Brown","Well, Government was really good, pretty much in every region. And in North America, as we said, it was really strong as well. I think, Craig, we had some very good systems business, i.e., infrastructure business in Q1, which actually lends itself positively forward-looking as you think about adding subscribers downstream over the next several quarters. But the demand, we've said public safety has always been typically prioritized higher. We continue to see that. I think it's representative of a strong systems business, which was seasonally stronger in Q1 than typical, and continued solid growth in our PCR business. So it continues to perform really well. And also we're refreshing the products, too. So we have -- we continue to tier our professional and commercial radio products. People are moving from analog to digital in the PCR business, and we think we're very well positioned to capitalize on that. So it's a combination of continued good momentum, product refresh and strong growth throughout the world.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","And Craig, what I would add there, too, is we had mentioned growth in Europe as well, right?  Europe had been relatively flat and down in prior quarters, probably for the last 8 quarters. So it was nice to see that return a little bit to growth, which was good.","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes, we had a double-digit growth in Government in North America, Latin America and Asia. And to Ed's point, we also grew in Europe as well, so it was a really good quarter for Government.","Operator","Next we will go to the site of Deepak Sitaraman with Credit Suisse.","Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Greg, just on your backlog, how much of the change in the backlog under the new reporting method is related to Public Safety LTE? And can you give us an update on how we should be thinking about timing, just of when Public Safety LTE can be meaningful for you?","Gregory Q. Brown","So the difference in backlog around Public Safety LTE is minimal. Because it's still very early-stage. Remember, we -- as Ed described, we had -- it's really -- the way we counted backlog in Motorola was more of a legacy issue of traditional Motorola, Inc., i.e., we were only -- we were not including services, and we were only including backlog that went up to 18 months old. This is a much more comprehensive and all-in view that gives you and us greater visibility around the total enterprise. Backlog was up. Deepak, it's primarily driven by the award in Norway. Public Safety LTE was de minimis in terms of changing backlog quarter-over-quarter. In terms of overall contribution, we talk about beginning to get some traction in 2013 for Public Safety LTE and more meaningful contribution of 2014 and beyond.","Mark F. Moon","Deepak, just one quick comment. I think the encouraging piece, while Public Safety and Government was up, it's also important to note that Enterprise backlog was up as well. So even as we talk about it, I think it's a good sign as we go forward because pretty good growth in our Enterprise backlog as we move forward.","Gregory Q. Brown","And then, Deepak, one more clarification to add or -- when you break down the increase from the old methodology to the new, a little over $2 billion of the increase was due to the service contracts, and then about $500 million to $600 million of the increase was due to the 18-month rule that we had, just to give you a little more detail on that.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","And we -- I'll -- just so you know, we also filed, those are up on our website. You can see the backlog comparison, both new method and old.","Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great, that's really helpful. And just as my follow-up on capital allocation, specifically buybacks, given that  you almost threw the existing authorization that's outstanding, how should we think about buybacks? Are you going to continue to be opportunistic?  Or should we expect a steady cadence as you move toward a net debt position?","Gregory Q. Brown","So as we talked about at the Financial Analyst Meeting a little over a month ago, share repurchases remain a critical component of our capital allocation framework, so you should expect that to continue. With that said, on the current program, we've executed $2.5 billion out of the $3 billion program, so about $0.5 billion remaining. As we look at it from a how do we approach it throughout the rest of the year, I think you said it right, I think we will be opportunistic. If the price is lower, we'll be a bit more aggressive. And if it's a bit higher, we'll be a bit more measured as we move forward here. So you should expect to get update from us at the appropriate time. But again, remains a critical component of our capital allocation plans.","Operator","The next question comes from the site of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if we could delve a little deeper into this -- the TETRA contract in Norway. Should we be thinking of this as kind of a blueprint for how you would expect contract awards in the LTE first-responder market in terms of the inclusiveness of the contracts, links and dollar amount so forth? And then secondly, the backlog growth in Government, looks like if you backed out that Norwegian contract, it was actually down slightly. Is that seasonally normal?  Or do you have any year-over-year backlog numbers you can give us for that?","Mark F. Moon","So, Tavis, this is Mark. So if you think about the Norway contract, it's very similar to many of the contracts that we have for public safety throughout Europe. As we've talked about in the past, their contracting is a little different. When they look at nationwide contracts, similar to what we've done in Airwave, we have that kind of setup in a number of countries in Europe. And Norway in particular, that original award was to NSN, and we were only an equipment provider. This change was the customer actually awarded us the entire end-to-end offering as a prime contractor, so that includes a lot of services, a lot of other things as well. We do that similarly throughout Europe and in other parts of the world. As you compare it to LTE, I think that model is still to be determined. And I think there's a lot of work going on. We have some, as we've mentioned in the past, some individual contracts today that do look similar in some fashions to that. But I think the overall picture of the contracting methodology is still to unfold as this rolls out. When you think about backlog, the other comment, as we talked about all the details before, is, if we went back to our old methodology for a second, backlog was still -- excuse me, so I think the important piece is while Norway was the biggest piece of it, that it's still, overall, we didn't see any strong differences to Government and Enterprise other than the Norway change.","Gregory Q. Brown","And just to have us a little bit more color, so overall backlog is up. As Mark referenced, Enterprise backlog is up, as is Government. To your specific inquiry, if you back out Norway, Government backlog is down slightly, which, yes, is seasonally consistent with previous periods.","Operator","Next we will go to the site of Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First of all, Greg, I know that your air defense system that you sold Macy's has to do with WiFi security, but I still can't get the image out of my mind of Bloomingdale's attacking them from the north and they needing some kind of, like, missile defense system against them. It just stuck in my mind. A couple of questions. Your guidance for Q1, obviously, was 4% growth. You did 7%, you're guiding next quarter at 6%. I realize there's an item decline going on here as well, but you're still keeping your full year guidance at 5%, which would imply, for the most part, decelerating year-over-year. Given the out-performance in Q1, what didn't give you the confidence to raise your full year guidance?  Just if you can walk us through what your plus and minuses in thinking about that? Then on the Norway contract, the $750 million, did NSN recognize any of that ahead of time? So is the remaining part of that contract that you're actually buying in or opting into now, less than $750 million? If you can give us a sense as to what that is? And then the strength that you did see in Government this quarter, can you -- is there a way of discerning how much of that came from narrowbanding versus regular course of business?","Gregory Q. Brown","So on Norway, NSN did not -- when we talk about the $750 million opportunity, that is for us through 2026. NSN did not recognize any piece of that. In terms of overall 2012, just to be clear, we are more confident than we were a quarter ago in our full year outlook. In addition to that, we're only 90 days into the year. And there's elections going on in France. We had, as expected, softness in Europe, European Enterprise, specifically. Enterprise was pretty healthy in the other regions. But we just want to take it in a more measured way and see what happens in Q2 and update you then accordingly. I think it is important, though, we are more confident in the full year outlook. And iDEN decline, we continue to manage, and I think we'll be able to do that. Government was a little bit stronger, Enterprise returning to normal levels. So I think it's more of a stay-tuned situation, and we'll update as we get another quarter underneath our belt. And your third question was...","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Narrowbanding?","Gregory Q. Brown","Narrowbanding. I think it was fairly modest, is my instinct on Q1. Mark, I don't know what you think.","Mark F. Moon","I think the overall effect of narrowbanding is clearly impacting the move to digital. But we see this move to digital around the world, so it's not just a North America phenomenon. We're having strong growth rates in the digital portfolio worldwide. So -- and I think you'll continue to see that as we go forward.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can I sneak a quick follow-up, margins? As iDEN falls off, obviously iDEN's a very high margin business, so your Enterprise margin comes down. Although it's not really coming down, it's just kind of a function of the mix, I think, with iDEN. What's the right operating margin we should think of for the Enterprise business without iDEN?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","I think we talk about that in kind of full year terms, because it really depends on the quarter. As you know, we ramp up sales throughout the year. So on a full year basis, we said that the Government and Enterprise businesses were relatively stable, are relatively consistent in the aggregate without iDEN. So you could think of it in that term. I think the Government a bit higher, but they're relatively comparable, if you will, for the full year results, Ehud. And what you should think of as well, both businesses improving year-over-year. Operating earnings, as a percent of sales, both Government and Enterprise, Enterprise if you back out iDEN improving nicely, both about 1% that we had talked about before.","Operator","Next, we will go to the site of Peter Misek with Jefferies.","Peter Misek - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess the first question really comes down to pensions. How much more in payments do we have? Where are we in terms of expectations, plans, expectations, et cetera? If you could provide some color there, that would be great. And then I have a follow-up.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Sure, on the pension expense. Pension expense, we talked about it being up approximately, U.S. pension expense, approximately $60 million year-over-year. I mentioned on the call the quarter impact of that was about $13 million to the quarterly results. The cash flow impact to that, I think, were about $100 million higher, $340 million of contributions this year to the U.S. pension plan. That's kind of incorporated in our full year cash forecast. And as I mentioned on the prior call, we do expect full year operating cash flow or free cash flow to be up from the prior year relatively in line with our improvement in operating earnings for the full year.","Peter Misek - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And how much of that cash, $340 million, have you contributed so far already in the year?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","You'll see it in the Q. I think it's -- I think we're about $130 million. I think we did $70 million after the quarter, and we did something in the $60 million range. So about $130 million.  It's relatively smooth throughout the year.","Peter Misek - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And do you expect pensions next year, similar sort of outlay to top it up, or is that how we should look at it?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","I think the cash contributions next year are relatively consistent. It may go up a bit. I think the expense right now that we're seeing will be up slightly. It won't be quite the impact that we saw this year. And that all depends on the discount rates, as you know, right? So, discount rates can go up or down. If they go up, we'll see a benefit. If they go down, God forbid, may see a bit of an increase. But right now, if it's -- everything stays where we expected it, should be a muted impact in the next year.","Peter Misek - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just to put a bow on all of this, if we look at your cash movements and we look at working capital requirements, in terms of the business, the backlog and what you're seeing in growth, et cetera, I would expect, and please clarify if this is incorrect, that your working capital requirements are probably at the level they need to be. I would expect that your LTE equipment prebuilds or trials, et cetera, would have already started, and you're contributing to that? I guess my point of my question is don't we have a situation where cash is going to be greater than what you thought 30, 60, 90 days ago and therefore we could probably see a little bit more repatriation to shareholders?  That's my final question.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","I think we still feel good about cash for the full year. A lot of the things that we've seen so in the full year forecast for profit's consistent with what we had planned and what we had talked to you about last quarter. So still expecting cash flow to improve year-over-year based upon that improved earnings. There are some -- there will be some increase in working capital as our sales ramp year-over-year. We are planning for improvements in inventory turns -- improvement in inventory turns year-over-year. We do have a bit of work to do still on receivables, as I mentioned, collecting certain long-term receivables that were reclassified to short term this quarter. And we'll try to get at some of that this quarter. But I think that at the end of the day, the cash guidance that we gave for you, the cash flow guidance, is still consistent with what we expected. Working capital ramp a little bit, but our working capital efficiency, as we normally try to do to, to challenge ourselves, has improved year-over-year.  We are driving to do that. And that's factored into that outlook I just gave you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And next we will go to the site of Matt Thornton with Avian Securities.","Matthew Thornton - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division","Not to beat a dead horse, but on Enterprise, I guess, 2 questions. Can you kind of just talk about the linearity in the quarter? And then secondly, one of your prime comps in that business just missed their numbers by about 12%. So I'm wondering if you can talk to kind of a share shift in that business as well and whether you think you're taking share in the Enterprise business?","Gregory Q. Brown","So I think it was clearly too early in terms of Q1, Matt. But I think that when we think about our core Enterprise portfolio over the last 4 to 8 quarters, our view in -- our view is we're holding -- we're slightly gaining share in advanced data capture and in enterprise mobile computing. WLAN probably holding -- maybe a slight decline in WLAN overall, but in that case in the WLAN business, it's experiencing from a segment growth, 30%- or 35%-plus growth. So again, Enterprise backlog, Matt, was up. It was -- our Enterprise business in Europe was soft, as anticipated. But overall, we were generally pleased, with the exception of Enterprise in Europe. And of course, that the overall segment reporting includes iDEN, but we've talked about that. And we'll manage that in a measured way year-over-year and continue to do that.","Mark F. Moon","So one quick add-on. If you think about the linearity, I think, as Greg indicated, we do think that it will continue to return. I would remind you that in Europe, we were coming off of a comparable year-ago quarter of 29% growth. So even when we talk about it being down, I don't want you to leave with the impression that Enterprise growth in Europe is really concerning. We clearly are watching it carefully, but it's coming off of a strong comparable. As we move throughout the year, we still to continue to think that Enterprise growth overall will continue on kind of the pace as we've indicated in the past and will return back to those normal levels, as Greg indicated earlier.","Matthew Thornton - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful, and just one follow-up, if I could. Greg, I'm sure you're aware, the NTIA's advising a lot of the different jurisdictions that have planned to build out public safety LTE Networks, they're advising them to hold off until the first net organization can kind of provide the blueprint, if you will, later on this year to ensure interoperability. I know Public Safety LTE revenue is de minimis at this point, but you expect or do you anticipate any impact from potential delays there in the back half of this year?","Gregory Q. Brown","I don't think it will be a big deal for us one way or another this year. I do believe that I'm mindful of what needs to be implemented regarding the overall legislation, but having said that, BTOP grants have been extended to a number of customers with waivers. And we think it's very important for our customers for them to maintain that momentum and to continue to build and deploy accordingly. Because we believe those deployments are entirely consistent and compatible with the overall rollout vis-\u00e0-vis Public Safety LTE in the 700 MHz band. So we wouldn't want to have any unintended consequences of pausing or hitting the stop button that would appear to be disruptive for our customers, disruptive for employees and, quite frankly, disruptive from a job continuity standpoint. We want to continue to move forward, and we think we're able to do that but also be complimentary and mindful of what they need to do vis-\u00e0-vis first net going forward.","Matthew Thornton - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And if I could sneak in just one housekeeping one for Ed. Ed, I think you guys had about $37 million in stock-based comps. You know what that split of that is between R&D and SG&A?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","I don't have that at my fingertips.","Operator","Next we will go to the site of Dale Wettlaufer with Morningstar.","Dale Wettlaufer - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just wondering how much of a threat is iPad to enterprise computing? And I have a follow-up after that.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","The majority of our Enterprise -- we think it's quite low, because the Enterprise mobile computing business is, for us, is more around rugged, heavy industrial scanning, warehouse, back room e-commerce. We have very little presence in front-facing store operations -- some, but the requirements for our devices are more around ruggedization and heavy industrial use. So we think it's reasonably small at this point.","Dale Wettlaufer - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then backlog ex Norway, I don't think you gave the year-over-year number, unless I missed that?","Gregory Q. Brown","We did not. We didn't because we're -- we've recalculated the 18-month backlog to the full life cycle backlog plus services. So we think the most accurate information we can give you is sequentially quarter-over-quarter. And again, overall, it's up. It's up in Government, it's up in Enterprise as well.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Yes, I don't think -- just to give color. I don't expect that you would see any significant changes given just history of that, it's been relatively stable. So the one big change really relates to Norway.","Dale Wettlaufer - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could ask another question on that. Is the Norway contract among your largest managed services contracts? And could you describe the scope of the contract?","Mark F. Moon","Yes, so it is one of the largest. I think we had mentioned, although we have a number of large managed services contracts throughout the world, this clearly is in a whole different game when you look at the size. It will actually be deploying a nationwide TETRA network throughout the entire country of Norway, and that will include site buildouts, equipment installation, operations of that network once it is deployed, and it will be deployed in a number of phases. And then, ultimately, obviously, when you talk about operations, it's not just operating the network, but also maintaining it. And as we look going forward, we think we'll continue to upgrade it with technology over this life cycle of the project.","Operator","And next we will go to the site of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","Question for you on foreign exchange for the quarter. Obviously, we saw some significant movement around the world. Can you guys provide a little bit of color about how that, perhaps, impacts your results, both from a top line and bottom line perspective?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Sure.  The biggest impact top line was driven by the euro, but not overly significant. We talked about a little bit about $10 million impact during the quarter, that was offset by some favorability in Asia, partially offset. In operating earnings, it was probably a $4 million to $5 million impact to the negative, and EPS, probably relatively flat for the quarter.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","Great.  And then one follow-up, if I may.  In terms of pricing, I guess let's come back to your Enterprise segment. How was pricing in the quarter?  Were you aggressive in some pockets or is it fairly typical for the first quarter?","Mark F. Moon","I think we actually saw typical pricing for what we would expect for the first quarter.  As we've looked at our ASPs across the portfolio, they've been able to maintain, again, part of that driven by some new product introductions. But nothing unusual as we look at what happened in the quarter.","Operator","And there are no further questions in queue. So I would like to announce that this does conclude today's teleconference.

Greg and Gino will review our results, along with commentary, and Mark will join for the Q&A portion of the call.","We have posted an earnings presentation and press release in motorolsolutions.com. These materials include a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for your reference, which we encourage you to review. In addition, we will post an historical view of the combined Government and iDEN business for the past eight quarters on our site later today.","A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation.

Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements contained in this presentation.","And with that, I would like to now turn it over to Greg.","Greg Brown","Thanks, Shep and good morning and thanks for joining us today. I\u2019d like to share a few thoughts with you relative to our overall business and specifically to the quarter. First, following the sale of our Enterprise business, our remaining business will be positioned as a singularly focused leader in mission-critical communications to public safety and commercial customers. I believe our government business is truly differentiated with an outstanding product portfolio, a vast and global install base, R&D leadership, a great sales and partner network and people that wake up everyday thinking about mission-critical communications. And I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us and believe this business is positioned for solid, profitable growth over the long-term.","I wanted to highlight some key points relative to the Enterprise transaction itself. First, we expect the deal to close by the end of the year or sooner generating cash proceeds of $3.45 billion, which we intend to return to shareholders in a timely manner. This transaction is effectively tax free to us and preserves our deferred tax assets. The deal will include our reported Enterprise segment with the exception of iDEN, which will remain with Motorola Solutions. Approximately 4,500 people will transition to Zebra along with other Enterprise assets and liabilities. Approximately $100 million of stranded costs allocated to our Enterprise segment will remain with MSI following the sale. We are moving swiftly to eliminate or offset these stranded costs and Gino will cover that in more detail in a few minutes.","Now, moving on to the quarter, there are three key points I would like to emphasize. First, sales were lower than we expected during the quarter. Approximately $20 million of the difference is attributable to the Government business, while Enterprise made up the balance as we originally anticipated growth in Enterprise for the quarter. As we previously indicated, aged backlog in Q1 was the primary driver for the year-on-year decline. We also saw additional weakness in overall North America market demand.","Second, we plan to reduce our cost structure to reflect both the Enterprise sale impact as well as the current business environment. While we made solid progress on taking cost and inefficiencies out of our business since we launched MSI at the beginning of 2011, we will accelerate our cost reduction actions in 2014. We have a number of opportunities that we will look at, including reducing our real estate footprint, reducing IT complexity, reducing manufacturing costs, and improving overall supply chain efficiency.","And third and finally, the fundamentals of our Government business remain strong. Our pipeline remains robust and we continue to grow multi-year services backlog in core business \u2013 in our core business year-on-year while posting another quarter of services growth. These factors coupled with investments in growth such as areas as public safety LTE, geographic and vertical market expansion and smart public safety have us positioned well for long-term growth.","I will now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on our Q1 results and then I will return to provide additional thoughts and color on the quarter.","Gino Bonanotte","Thank you, Greg. Today, we reported first quarter GAAP sales of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 9% from last year. Sales in Government declined 11%, while Enterprise sales were down 4% and less than 1% when excluding the iDEN business. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $212 million or 12% of sales and operating cash flow improved by $77 million over the prior year quarter. On a GAAP basis, net earnings were $0.49 per share compared to $0.68 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net earnings were $0.50 per share compared to $0.66 per share in Q1 of last year. For the remainder of this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise noted.","Turning to our Government reporting segment, Government sales in Q1 were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 11% from the prior year. The biggest driver of Q1 revenue decline was our North America business primarily due to lower aged backlog, a challenging federal business comparison and lower than expected subscriber orders during the quarter. And while we planned for North America government to be down in Q1 and for the year, overall market demand fell below those expectations.","Our Europe and Africa region grew due to strong TETRA product and services performance driven by a number of large contracts. Asia-Pacific and the Middle East declined low single-digits, approximately $4 million. And our professional and commercial radio business grew high single-digits in the all regions with the exception of North America, which declined by $39 million, reflecting overall market demand weakness.","Operating income in the Government segment was $140 million, down $77 million to 11.7% of revenue driven by the impact of lower sales. Enterprise revenue, excluding iDEN were down $4 million or less than 1% to $573 million as certain deals moved out of Q1. We remain encouraged by the continued customer engagement and momentum in our new products. Operating income in the Enterprise business was $72 million, or 12%, up from the year ago quarter. Improved gross margins and lower OpEx drove the improved earnings.","For total MSI, operating expenses were $639 million, which is down $45 million from the year ago quarter driven by actions taken in 2013 as well as additional actions taken in Q1. These actions include a reduction of our real estate footprint by almost 1 million square feet since the beginning of 2013. This comprises nearly 25 sites, including the sale of a portion of our headquarters in Schaumburg during Q1, which generated $25 million in cash and also the sale of our Reynosa, Mexico manufacturing facility, which closed just a few days ago. The Enterprise sale will provide additional opportunities for optimizing our footprint and fixed costs to align with our more focused business needs.","Giving the Enterprise sale, the pending enterprise sale and current market environment, we are moving swiftly to simplify our corporate structure and reduce additional costs. As such, we plan to reduce approximately $200 million of cost. $100 million which offsets the stranded costs Greg talked of will be reduced in 2014. An incremental $100 million will be removed over the next 18 to 24 months. These savings will come from G&A as well as select areas within R&D and sales and marketing.","Shifting to other income and expense, this line item was a net expense of $19 million in the quarter compared to a net expense of $11 million in the year ago quarter. Our interest expense of $25 million was partially offset by $7 million of gains on the sale of several investments within our ventures portfolio during the quarter. We expect this line item to be an expense of approximately $45 million in Q2. For the remainder of the year, we continue to expect this line item to be an expense of approximately $40 million per quarter, which is primarily driven by $35 million of quarterly interest expense. We expect the Q2 tax rate to be 33% to 34%. Upon the close of the Enterprise sale, we expect our ongoing effective tax rate to be 32% to 33%. Based on our current outlook, we expect our cash tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 15% for the full year 2014. As a result of the Enterprise sale, we now expect a cash tax rate of approximately 15% through 2019, an additional two years.","Moving on to cash flow, cash generated by operating activities in the first quarter was $46 million, a $77 million improvement from the prior year, primarily from the timing of our long-term contract milestone buildings and the return of cash that was seized by the Government of India related to a tax dispute in the first quarter of 2013. Partially offsetting these items, we saw an uptick in inventory at quarter end due to lower than expected sales in both segments. We ended Q1 with $3.1 billion in total cash and $2.5 billion in debt.","With respect to capital return, we repurchased $57 million or approximately 1 million shares at an average price of $66.32 per share. This lower repurchase activity was a result of trading restrictions due to the ongoing discussions leading to the Enterprise sale announcement. In addition to repurchase activity, we paid $79 million in dividends during the quarter. As a reminder, we have approximately $1.7 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. We have repurchased 26% of the net share count outstanding since Q3 of 2011 at an average price of $50.13 per share.","Now turning to our outlook, we expect total company sales for Q2 to decline 5% to 8% with non-GAAP earnings per share between $0.58 and $0.64. For total MSI, we expect 2014 sales to be down low-single digits with operating margins of approximately 18.5%, consistent with our prior outlook. We expect government revenues to be down 8% to 11% for the second quarter. For the full year, we expect government sales to decline low to mid-single digits. iDEN sales are expected to decline by $20 million in Q2 compared to Q2 2013 and approximately $100 million for the full year.","I will now turn it back to Greg.","Greg Brown","Thanks Gino. Now I would like to spend some time on the Q1 results and business units. Our Q1 ASTRO contract wins continued. Some of the large notable contracts included a $113 million system refresh and services contract with the State of Indiana, multiple Latin America military customers worth nearly $60 million, several Canadian first responder and city contracts and Asia Police and Middle East Defense departments. The wins also spanned our portfolio with wins in Phase 2 TDMA systems, APX radios, services, software upgrades and consoles. In Q1, we added three new models to our industry leading APX 25 portfolio and now have a number of product families with targeted derivatives of each product to meet customer needs. The additional radio models include new, small, value based, ruggedized form factors as well as our dual band P25 LTE radio that enables LMR voice and faster over the air data transfer.","On the systems side, we added key software and systems enablement that includes automatic vehicle tracking, a command center application for geographic top group management and software enablement for migrating customer transitions from analog to digital. Our TETRA business grew double digits, driven by strong subscriber shipments and services. Our portfolio position and customer focus continue to drive current success and positive momentum for the future. In Q1 we successfully demonstrated live video streaming over Norway\u2019s Nodnett TETRA network using TETRA enhanced data services. We also earned awards at 2014 TETRA International for best TETRA innovation and best use of TETRA utilities. Our global momentum and TETRA wins continued in multiple verticals such as government, corrections and railroad.","Our professional and commercial radio business declined single digits compared to the year ago quarter driven by lower sales in North America and reflecting lower overall market demand. We had solid single-digit growth in all other regions. Additionally, we are continuing to demonstrate our leadership in this market with our best in class digital portfolio and we continued to invest for growth. For example, we acquired Twisted Pair Solutions, a recognized leader in push to talk over broadband applications for secure, real time communication anywhere and on any device. And finally we see encouraging engagement in both the government and commercial PCR businesses winning major deals with the railroad, a major automotive manufacturer and a multi-million dollar deal in retail.","In addition, we continue to invest for the long-term in our growth areas including public safety LTE, services and smart public safety. In Q1 we expanded our public safety LTE portfolio with the refresh of our LEX 700 to utilize the Android operating system. Additionally, we launched the APX 7000L, a converged device that utilizes LTE for fast data transfer on a land mobile radio voice device. And we are seeing marketplace validation of this focus with the recent wins such as the $175 million LA-RICS contract as well as the previously announced international public safety LTE contract for $100 million.","Additionally we continue to grow our services business that includes traditional network management as well as expanded offerings to include managed service offerings and smart public safety solutions. In Q1 alone we closed eight large service deals with durations as long as 20 years. Additional significant support agreements were also signed with the Public Building Commission of Chicago and the Minnesota Department of Transportation. Lastly three European police departments selected us for multi-year life cycle services as well. These service contracts demonstrate our ability to secure various recurring revenue streams built on our mission critical platforms and services.","Turning to the Enterprise business, which will be reported in discontinued operations beginning in Q2 the Enterprise business excluding iDEN declined $4 million or approximately 1% versus Q1 of 2013. Globally mobile computing declined single digits, offset by single-digit improvements in advanced data capture and double-digit growth in WLAN. In North America, mobile computing was down double digits due to fewer large orders and channel softness, while advanced data capture was up double digits. Europe and Africa was up single digits on strong mobile computing demand and growth across the portfolio. Asia-Pac Middle East was down low double digits primarily in enterprise global computing against strong comps in Q1 of 2013 and several deals being pushed out of the quarter.","The Enterprise product portfolio continues to evolve its industry leading position with the growth of the Android portfolio. We continue to see strong demand for the Android based TC55 and we have recently won a significant multi-million dollar order with a large U.S. retailer for nearly 4,000 units. Additionally, the adoption of Android has been robust with the strengthening partner ecosystems, supported by a significant uptick in partners going from Gingerbread to Jelly Bean and 135 Android applications now certified on our devices. The traction on other new product wins was also notable with a major contract win for 10,000 units of our Smart Badge 1 to CVS. Likewise, we expanded our MP6000 rollout with a major global retailer. And finally, our focus on transitioning our WLAN solution to a more services based model has helped drive a significant double-digit jump in WLAN revenue. Lastly, our product innovation received numerous industry awards as well including the HC1, as an Edison Award finalist, and the VC70, which was chosen for the 2013 Good Design Award and the TC55 Red Dot Award.","Now having said all that let me close with four points on our Government business. First, even though we planned for North America to be down for the quarter and for the year, the overall market demand is lower than we expected. So as a result, I am obviously disappointed in the recent challenges we have had in calling the business. But second, despite this environment we gained worldwide market share in each of our major products in 2013. Third, we still believe in the long-term growth and fundamentals of this business given our pipeline and strong backlog. Our backlog is growing year-on-year, driven largely by multi-year services contracts and we are very well positioned with recent wins in public safety LTE. And fourth and finally, our singularly focused company will enable greater operational efficiency and improved agility. We intend to streamline our corporate structure that improves our operating leverage as we return to growth and given our excess capital, the pending Enterprise transaction and operating cash flow potential, the opportunity still remains for a healthy return of capital.","I will now turn it back over to Shep before we open it up for questions.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks. Before we begin taking questions, I would like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up so we can accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, could you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Tavis McCourt - Raymond James","Hi guys. I guess my two questions are your \u2013 you expected North America business to be down this year, what was the rationale for the expectation, it looks like your biggest competitor in North America is also seeing double digit declines, is there something inherent in the market right now that causing this weakness whether it\u2019s a pause in front of LTE or are we still coming off narrow band I was just trying to understand why it doesn\u2019t seem to be an MSI issue, it seems to be an industry issue? And then secondly just a clarification on the full year guidance, is the full year guidance, including Enterprise or is that with Enterprise as a disco op? Thanks.","Greg Brown","Tavis, thanks. On the first question, I think it\u2019s primarily a North America government issue and I think we underestimated the overhanging impact from narrowbanding. I think that we are still very well positioned for the long-term fundamentals, but to your point, I think it\u2019s more of an industry issue. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a structural issue. I think it\u2019s a temporary issue given the narrowbanding and quite frankly perhaps even iDEN Sprint network shutdown, because we had record years in 2011 and 2012 in state and local, in ASTRO subscriber and PCR and that\u2019s really what I think it is. We still plan for North America to be down for both the quarter and the year in 2014, but knowing what we know now, I think narrowbanding had a greater impact than we originally thought. In terms of full year guidance, I will turn it to Gino.","Gino Bonanotte","Tavis, in terms of full year guidance, the low to mid single-digit for government that we stated is not inclusive of iDEN. We mentioned iDEN before, mentioned $100 million reduction in iDEN revenue. Was that the question, Tavis?","Tavis McCourt - Raymond James","Let me clarify, so that low to mid single-digit, that doesn\u2019t include the iDEN decline? That\u2019s correct?","Gino Bonanotte","It does not.","Tavis McCourt - Raymond James","It does not. And then the 18.5% operating margin is that inclusive of enterprise or is that government and iDEN combined or just government?","Gino Bonanotte","It\u2019s government and iDEN combined.","Tavis McCourt - Raymond James","But not enterprise?","Gino Bonanotte","Well, it\u2019s actually the same number.","Tavis McCourt - Raymond James","Okay, either way.","Gino Bonanotte","Right.","Tavis McCourt - Raymond James","Got it. Okay, cool. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Pierre Ferragu - Bernstein","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, first of all, Greg could you give us a bit more color on what happened, how things played out between late January when you guided for the first quarter and like a couple of months later when you realized you would not \u2013 you would have to announce numbers below your guidance. On my rough mark, you had a shortfall in revenue like in the 3%, 4% region and if you think about 80% of your business being something in which you have a bit of clarity with your backlog as a percentage of the 20% of revenues you had to go after in this quarter, it\u2019s quite a big number. And so any color you could give us on where like the disappointment came from and why you have that much visibility on that? And then from there, if you could tell us how you have been building out your guidance for Q2 in terms of this 20% of the business you have to go after, how much \u2013 how do you feel about that, how much risk do you see on that number? And then your full year guidance for government implies quite a second half after all if I am not wrong in my early calculations. And so I am just curious to invest in where you get this confidence from in terms of the second half, where do you think you will have better visibility and if that\u2019s the case, why?","Greg Brown","So, Pierre, I will do my best to recount. You asked a few questions. First of all, on the 80% visibility coming into the quarter, approximately 80% that remains unchanged. You described it well that in any one quarter, we have about 20% to go get coming into a quarter. Given the size of the business of MSI that\u2019s still about $400 million roughly per quarter, what\u2019s different than January is we underestimated the overhang impact of narrowbanding, and as a result, we had the $20 million government shortfall, speaking to government now in Q1, and then we had movement in orders in Q1 and Q2, then I will turn it over to Mark Moon for additional commentary. I think as it relates to our Q2 guidance, it\u2019s our best estimate that we have incorporated into some of the things that we are seeing now, hence the negative 8%, the negative 11% for the Government segment itself. And then on the full year, I will ask Mark to provide some color.","Mark Moon","Thanks, Greg. And I think when we talk about Q1, as we said obviously we knew that we have the gap \u2013 we had to convert some orders in Q1 to be able to make the revenue guidance that we have provided. The piece that we had also called out was the impact of narrowbanding, which we underestimated. And Greg also briefly mentioned the Nextel shutdown, which actually led to strong growth in our PCR business the last couple of years and even in the first quarter of last year that spilled over. Gino called out, that was $39 million is well of a miss that we had underestimated. So, as a result of those things and orders not only converting in the quarter, so we were expecting to convert orders that would provide revenue in Q2 and for the rest of year. Now, on re-look, we see many of those orders, approximately $300 million in the first half that have been pushed to the second half.","Now, with that said, the pipeline and our visibility to those orders and orders in the second half is very good. In fact, we continue to have very good engagements and our second half pipeline is over $1 billion stronger than the first half pipeline. So, when you talked at the end about what would give us confidence or risk and the comments that you made around the second half, it is really that pipeline, the fact that we have got a number of contracts that we have received in hand, a couple in particular like LA-RICS and the State of Maryland, that we now have $75 million that is not currently aged in our backlog. And as we move for the full year, remember the second half of last year had a huge decline in federal government. We talked about $150 million decline in the second half. It was the worst second half and the worst full year we have ever had in federal government.","Now, we have budget certainty, which was approved in January, which we didn\u2019t have last year. The pipeline is reflecting a ramp up from the government shutdown and some pent up demand. So, at the end of the day, we really have good visibility to what we are calling throughout the rest of the year. And from a federal perspective, we are really only assuming modest growth for the full year. Even though it will be a $70 million increase in the second half, only very modest, less than 20% growth for the full year again coming off the worst year we have had.","Greg Brown","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. We will next go to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Hi, thanks very much. I have just a couple of questions. The first one is as I recall for most of last year, you were seeing a higher mix shift of infrastructure sales. I think you might have said that it was a double-digit increase and historically we see a follow-on effect with higher device sales, which were in fact weak in the quarter you just reported. Can you just walk us through that dynamic a little bit? Would you still expect those follow-on device sales and there might have been some reason for why they didn\u2019t come through, but they should still come through in the rest of the year or there is something different about those infrastructure sales last year?","Mark Moon","Simona, this is Mark. We don\u2019t really see anything different about infrastructure sales. And as you talked about into the comments that we made early, was that subscribers were less than we had anticipated in the quarter. In fact, we continue to have stronger infrastructure sales which we are positive about. We also continue to have stronger multi-year services sales, which are building very strong backlog, but not necessarily feeding revenue in the very short-term. When we talk about the Nextel shutdown and when we also talk about narrowbanding, which pulled a lot of new infrastructure or accelerated infrastructure into the year that also led to some subscriber acceleration, which led to the piece that we talked about here in Q1 and Q2. As an overall result, we still expect we believe our portfolio is in wonderful shape. We mentioned a couple of new models of our industry leading APX portfolio. We still expect subscriber growth to return as we move forward.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then my second question was on the new APX 7000L, which I think is your first converged device that handles both LTE data and LMR voice. So, that seems to be a change relative to how you initially were approaching this market with separate LMR and LTE devices. And so I was hoping you can talk about the strategy there a little bit? And also if we think about this device relative to an equivalent LMR-only device, what would be the like-for-like ASP list?","Mark Moon","There is really no change in strategy. In fact, we have always talked about we will continue to lead in our mission-critical voice portfolio. And as we have talked about, we believe we will also lead in public safety LTE portfolio, both in infrastructure and devices. We have often talked about the end to end portfolio and services component that we believe we will offer that none of our other competitors will. This first converged device we think is what the industry will ultimately want to go to. We know that customers, as Greg mentioned LA-RICS earlier will look to have devices like that that are able to both handle LMR and LTE. There will also be the need for collaborative devices and most customers will like that, dual devices LMR device and a LTE only device, which will also feed that portfolio both with devices and with modems as we go forward. So all in all, it\u2019s strictly own our strategy of record. We actually, again believe we are leading. We are excited about this new product. And the ASPs will be slightly, again as you would think, this is complementary to having more features, more capabilities and the ASPs will be slightly higher than what you would see in a traditional LMR or P25 device.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","So just to clarify, I think in the past you had talked about LTE as kind of an incremental multi-billion opportunity, which if it was an incremental device I can sort of see how that could happen, if this is really still the same device but with more features and a slightly higher ASPs, would that still support that kind of large incremental opportunity or should we just think of it as more of a slight ASP mix shift effect over time but not really a multi-billion increment?","Greg Brown","I will let Mark answer, but Simon I think we still see it as an incremental multi-billion dollar opportunity over the long term both infrastructure and subscriber devices. There are people but \u2013 some that will keep different devices, video or data only and voice LMR. There are some that will go with converged devices. And for some with converged devices it\u2019s not just necessarily an ASP potential lift but it could also be an event over time to upgrade subscriber radios. So it really doesn\u2019t change the way we have looked at it and we still see LTE and public safety LTE as being incremental to the land mobile radio business.","Mark Moon","Yes. Just complementing, I think it\u2019s just \u2013 this new announcement is another device in our overall portfolio. As you are aware we had announced last year a LEX 700 device that was actually Microsoft based. We have now come back with a Google upgrade of that as well or Android upgrade. We will also announce this device and there will be a series of devices just like we do in the LMR portfolio, we will continue to build out that subscriber and device portfolio for public safety LTE.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Hey guys. Can you hear me?","Greg Brown","Yes.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Awesome. Thanks. So first thing on narrowbanding, I am glad that you are starting to see that it probably had more of an impact. It did kind of end a year and a half ago mostly in 2012 even though there is a little bit of an impact probably in 2013, when you are looking at your long-term growth rate and you are basing it on historical numbers, narrowbanding obviously didn\u2019t just happen in 2012, it was something that was out there for a number of years five, six, seven years and kept being pushed out, so there is a chance that narrowbanding may have had an impact to your growth rate numbers for five, six years even before you split off from Motorola Mobility, how do you get a handle on what the true underlying growth rate is to give you confidence on your long-term growth rate of 2% to 3% versus thinking that maybe all the historical numbers that you have looked at may actually not be necessarily indicative of what\u2019s going forward putting aside LTE. And then I have got a follow-up on operating margins. Thanks.","Greg Brown","So maybe we will tag team it. But I think if you normalize the way we think about it is normalize for the record years of 2011 and \u201812. And then maybe even to your point, maybe it\u2019s a little bit longer than that in anticipation. It\u2019s still from last 7 years or last 10 years, the average historical compounded annual growth rate is about 4%, 4.5%. But forgetting the rear view mirror looking forward, we still believe really the long-term fundamentals remain sound. We still believe that mission critical communications remains an utmost priority. We still look at the multi-billion dollar install base internationally as an addressable market opportunity to upgrade. We have talked about the fact that there is about 10,000 plus systems, 16% more than 10 years old. When you look at the PCR radio business and that base 35 million or 40 million PCR radios worldwide, 90% analog, 10% digital. There is the opportunities for growth that are geographical and vertical market expansion in our core mission critical business. As we provide more long-term services contract and lock a customer up for the long-term, it protects the customer base. It allows for technology refresh. It allows for more long-term annuity revenue streams. And then lastly is public safety LTE, which we believe as earlier stated is incremental. The U.S. and other countries are taking a business model that dedicates or allocates the spectrum, which is the model we believe is appropriate that will allow for public safety LTE infrastructure and incremental subscriber demand on top of that. So that\u2019s what we believe \u2013 not just historically, but we believe in the longer term growth drivers to get this to a low to mid-single digit business.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","So you think it\u2019s about let\u2019s say about two or three?","Greg Brown","I mean we \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be that precise given some of the recent challenges we have had I would just say low to mid.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Okay. On operating margin, if you just look historically at the pattern, Enterprise in 2010 and \u201811 had a higher operating margin than Government did, primarily because iDEN was in that mix, 2012 Government took over and was higher in terms of margin, more profitability and same with 2013, it looks like from, Gino your comments that both Enterprise and Government will have the same 18.5% operating margin this year. When you say that I am not 100% sure from the prior question whether where you are putting that corporate overhead, the $100 million dollars, is that in the Government that get \u2013 when you said they both have 18.5%, is that...?","Gino Bonanotte","Yes. So Ehud, just so I am clear when we talked about 18.5% we talked about approximately 18.5% for total MSI and approximately 18.5% for Remainco. In Remainco, in Government, the stranded costs are in Government. The $100 million of actions to offset those stranded costs that we will execute on in 2014 are predominantly Government segment actions.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","So then the $100 million additional in the next 12 to 18 months on roughly a $6 billion Remainco total gives you another 150 basis points with no \u2013 assuming no revenue growth of operating margin expansion, we would assume that going forward that as revenue grows therefore, so is that $100 million taking your OpEx from now and taking $100 million out, and that\u2019s your OpEx number or is OpEx going to grow from revenue growth and then $100 million off of what it would have been otherwise, because if you grow 3%, you will grow the top line about $100 million and you will expand operating margin that way in which case we could be go 200 to 300 basis points of operating margin expansion. If you can just help us understand what happens to OpEx as revenue grows, I guess, vis-\u00e0-vis the $100 million OpEx\u2026?","Greg Brown","Clearly as revenue grows, there is opportunity for operating leverage. The commentary around cost reduction was the $200 million you think about it in terms of Remainco, $200 million is approximately a 10% BGM reduction on Remainco. Obviously with revenue growth, we have the opportunity for operating margin expansion.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","On the current OpEx level though, can you handle 3% revenue growth or will operating margin \u2013 operating expenses have to grow with a 3% top line, let\u2019s say?","Gino Bonanotte","Without getting into modeling \u201815 and \u201816, there may be slight OpEx increases, but we believe that we will be able to expand operating margin and we will have operating leverage when we return to growth.","Greg Brown","Yes, Ehud, as Gino said, $100 million is to be taken out. The target is to take it out this year. There is another $100 million beyond that. We are targeting about $200 million. By the way, there could be more than that. If there is, we will pursue that accordingly, but it\u2019s a below gross margin target. And Gino is right. There could be some uptick as the business returns to growth. But our goal is to size the business to a lower fixed cost model and a cost basis that\u2019s a reflection of more of a pure play simplified corporate structure. So since we are the Remainco business that spun off Mobility, which is mobile devices and set-top boxes, we monetized the network business and sold it to Nokia Siemens. We are doing what we think we are very excited about the Enterprise transaction to Zebra. We have had good customer feedback on putting those assets together for a pretty compelling end-to-end Enterprise Mobility play. We are simply saying that while we have taken action, there is room for more in the areas that we talked about, real estate, IT, supply chain, G&A and we are going to size the business as a reflection of our more simplified structure. And this is the time to do that.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Great. Appreciate it. Thanks guys.","Greg Brown","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research","Thanks guys. I appreciate the opportunity to ask question. I guess first question on your gross margins, gross margins were down for the quarter. Hoping you can give me a little bit of color on that? I am assuming a little bit is probably due to just the lower volume, but yet I see services are down significantly, I guess quarter-over-quarter. If it\u2019s Government-related, Enterprise-related, just any color you can offer there?","Greg Brown","Sure. With respect to gross margin, it\u2019s really a function of \u2013 we are not seeing ASP erosion in the Government segment within any specific products. So, it\u2019s a function of higher infrastructure and deployment services versus subscribers as well as higher TETRA volumes versus ASTRO and services growing faster than the overall business, which has an impact on gross margin, but with a similar OE profile. As well, the impact of a lower iDEN number impacts the gross margin percentage as well.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research","Got it. So, in general, does TETRA have a lower gross margin than ASTRO?","Greg Brown","Yes.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research","Okay, got it, got it. And then next question, I guess is more on competitive threats going forward and perhaps I don\u2019t understand the acquisition of Twisted Pair Solutions and what they do so much, but can you speak to I guess a competitive threat or is there a competitive threat with public safety forces, who perhaps don\u2019t need the mission-critical device, but have used one historically say like a police chief or fire chief, is there a threat of those guys using a consumer device, where previously they perhaps did not? Is that a concern going forward?","Mark Moon","I think if you look at those type of executives in policing as you just kind of described, most of them are carrying dual devices today. They carry a radio. They also carry a cell phone. So primarily, when you think about the Twisted Pair acquisition, it really wasn\u2019t targeted at that executive level of public safety even though it could be, but take a similar example in the commercial space, where you have a plant manager that may not want to carry a radio, that carries a cell phone, but maybe more to make from that cell phone, a push-to-talk call back to folks within the plant or within the manufacturing facility. That Twisted Pair combined with our MOTOTRBO Anywhere gives that capability. So, that could also be applied to an executive within public safety. And as we look at the Twisted Pair technology, we certainly are also leveraging that capability and technology as we move in our public safety LTE direction. But all-in-all, mission-critical voice is still a constant, it\u2019s still a priority. And throughout the world, public safety still is moving and continuing to see the importance of mission-critical voice.","Greg Brown","Just one additional item, Keith is probably the closest substitute to mission-critical voice that was available has been available historically was really the Nextel, the iDEN technology in terms of setup time, in terms of one to many groups. And through the Nextel period, we saw growth in mission-critical voice. So, we believe that mission-critical voice continues to be very important. And there is really, from a substitution perspective, there is nothing available that really shares the attributes in terms of a hardened network, call setup time, one-to-many that we offer in our voice.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research","So, if I understand correctly from what you are saying, it is not asked by a threat of those, I guess, unique individuals who perhaps have previously had a radio, they can now use a consumer device like a phone with a software solution? As you are saying that\u2019s not necessarily a threat to the overall sale of devices?","Greg Brown","As a matter of fact, I think it\u2019s an opportunity to combine, as Mark said, someone who traditionally perhaps would not interact with a fleet, with an LMR fleet, they have the ability on their device to talk to a plant manager that leaves the plant or anyone who leaves the coverage area would have the ability to interface on an LMR network.","Mark Moon","So, there is a lot of conversations, Keith about over-the-top push-to-talk exactly what you are just describing. And where we are saying that application if it\u2019s getting any traction is in the commercial space, we are seeing almost zero traction in mission-critical voice because of the attributes that Gino described.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research","Got it. Alright, I appreciate it guys. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets","Thank you. One for Gino, one for Greg. Gino, you talked a little bit about the gross margin in the quarter, understanding mix going forward, that will change around, but it sounds like some of Greg\u2019s initial comments talked about supply chain manufacturing costs and some efficiencies to be gained more on the gross margin line. So, just talk to us a little bit about mix aside what type of benefits we could see from some of the more gross margin-focused actions? And then Greg, I am just \u2013 this is certainly at least the second year in a row where we are seeing pretty backend loading of the year. So, do you think that\u2019s the trend or that\u2019s the norm from now on and maybe have to plan the business accordingly or do you think it\u2019s just a coincidence that it\u2019s been two in a row where we have gotten off to pretty weak starts in the year? Thank you.","Greg Brown","Well, let me do the second one and then Gino will talk gross margin. I think they are different. I think if we look at last year, the challenge we had was the unprecedented second half drop of our federal business. We have never seen it decline to levels in 10 years plus on the second half of last year. This is a Government business comment. And that being of course, no budget and the government shutdown, which happened \u2013 hasn\u2019t happened in about 20 years. That was a unique pressure point on the Government business in the second half. And then last year, of course, we had the Enterprise business and the cyclicality of that and trying to call its recovery. I think this is different. I think about this Government business and this is more of a narrowbanding, we believe overhang. So, I think the causes are necessarily different last year and this year. And I wouldn\u2019t necessarily conclude, Tim, that it\u2019s a trend longer term. We are just trying to comment on what we see this year and I think the factors are different \u2013 a little bit different this year than last.","Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets","Okay.","Gino Bonanotte","Tim, on gross margin we talked about Q1 and we talked about some of the differences between products and products versus services and the impact in Q1. Going back to Greg\u2019s comments on additional opportunities, we are around this idea of becoming singularly focused on one segment and reducing our structure and reducing fixed costs. An example of that would be I mentioned the Reynosa, Mexico facility, manufacturing facility that we had that we sold just announced a few days ago. So, we believe there are opportunities within IT to reduce complexity and simplify within our real estate footprint, manufacturing footprint to reduce complexity and simplify that will lead to a lower breakeven and a better cost profile. I mentioned the million square foot reduction since the beginning of 2013, I think it\u2019s instructive to note that since spin, we have had a 5 million square foot reduction, about 40% of our total square footage from spin to now has been reduced as well as 40 sites that have been closed since that timeframe. So, that work will continue and it will continue at an accelerated pace given the new MSI profile.","Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Peter Misek with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Peter Misek - Jefferies","Good morning. Maybe go back to the long-term growth rate and try and tackle it a different way, maybe you can give a sense for the install base of physical equipment and infrastructure domestically, any kind of rough age you can give us on that and maybe how that relates to LTE and FirstNet? And then I had a question on cash return.","Mark Moon","So, when you think about the age of the infrastructure, I think Greg may have mentioned it, but about 60% of the infrastructure that\u2019s deployed is over 10 years old, so relatively aging. 90% of the devices that are out there today are still analog have not moved to digital. As you know, the new technology is moving all to digital. So, the install base that is there is certainly in a position to be churned. And given our portfolio, we think there are capabilities that will also besides just aging push for some of that churn because of new features and functionality, new capabilities that are now available in our portfolio and through digital technology. As far as the LTE piece of that what we are seeing today is no impact on the traditional mission critical technologies from LTE. In fact, LA-RICS is a wonderful example where they just procured in a similar time the LTE network and a mission critical P25 network. The customer that\u2019s in Europe that we described a quarter ago for $100 million also is deploying a mission critical P25 technology. So the capabilities of each are different. One is about big data and being able to have video and situational awareness. The other is primarily about mission critical voice and the other features and capabilities that we have talked about for many years.","Peter Misek - Jefferies","Any way you can give us a size of that install base that is, you said over 60% of the install base is 10 plus years old, any way that we could sort of size that install base?","Mark Moon","Yes. Pete, it\u2019s several billion. But I would leave it at several billion. We will try to give some more color I think as we go forward.","Peter Misek - Jefferies","Because I think if you step back and you try and get a sense for that size, how much longer they could extend that life, what the savings are by moving to some of the newer mission critical voice and then by layering in the advantages of LTE, maybe that can help us get a sense for whether that long term growth rate you have put out there is really easily achievable or stretchable. Just in terms of cash return, obviously you are hoping the Enterprise deal is going to close here sooner rather than later, maybe you can articulate how you are thinking of splitting up that cash return, is it a bulk in terms of share repurchase and should we think of a tender offer for your shares as a way of using that cash up appropriately or are you going to hold it on your balance sheet and divvy it up over time in dividends and share repurchases and small acquisitions? Thank you.","Greg Brown","So Peter, I think the \u2013 as we stated in the call a couple weeks ago, the intent is to return the proceeds of the transaction in a timely manner. We haven\u2019t articulated and we will continue to work through exactly what form that takes and we will update you on that soon. But it is not our intent to hold that cash on the balance sheet.","Peter Misek - Jefferies","So you would anticipate that shortly after the close of the enterprise transaction there would be a capital return on that?","Greg Brown","Yes. We will return it in a timely manner and we will update you when the time is appropriate.","Peter Misek - Jefferies","Perfect. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Rod Hall, your line is open. And we will now move to Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, guys. Just one question, really can you give an update on FirstNet, where do you see it at, when do you \u2013 are we still looking at early next year for an impact on that, just any color you could provide would be appreciated? Thank you.","Greg Brown","I think we continue to work pretty closely with FirstNet and we are successful in working with them and the customer for LA-RICS. We continue to stay closely engaged with them. Mark Hacker is our lead General Counsel and one of the key operating executive interface points into the FirstNet group. And I will have Mark maybe make a little additional commentary on where we are, as well.","Mark Moon","So as Greg indicated, I think they continue to move down a path from their original plans to deploy this nationwide network. Their current announced intent is to release additional RFPs towards the end of the year which would say the response would move into next year, so it would probably be late next year, later in the next year for real activities to take place. I will let FirstNet speak to the timing but that\u2019s just extrapolating from their announced RFPs, a response and evaluation from those RFPs and then the direction they would need from that point.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","So we are looking at more of a \u201816 timeframe for when we really start to see the ramp in that business?","Mark Moon","Again, I think when we think of the LTE, we have talked about both FirstNet but also internationally. So we have talked about the real ramp being in the latter part of next year and into \u201816, I think FirstNet will fall into that same equation.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations for additional or closing remarks.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks. I just want to remind everyone that details outlining the highlighted items, our GAAP to non-GAAP P&L reconciliations and other financial information can be found on our website. An audio replay, together with a copy of today\u2019s slides will also be available on the site shortly after the conclusion of this call.","As mentioned at the outset, during this call, we made a number of forward-looking statements.

And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown","Good morning, and thanks, Shep. Thanks for joining us on our call today. As I think about the business and reflect on the quarter, there are 3 key themes that I'd like to cover. First, although down for the quarter, sales performance was in line with our expectations. We continue to see soft demand in North America state and local government, which we believe is largely a result of the narrowband impact from prior years. Despite this market pause, we do expect strong second half sales, given our improved pipeline and visibility of customer engagements that Mark will make comments on later in the call.","Second, we're making excellent progress on our cost reduction target of $200 million plus and today, we're increasing that target to approximately $300 million by the end of 2015. There's no better time than now to transform this company into a more nimble and flexible organization that can move faster and more efficiently to deliver the right results for our customers and partners and shareholders. This is not just about cutting costs. It's also about removing complexity, and it's also about redeploying some of the savings to make targeted investments and initiatives that will yield future growth.","And finally, we remain focused and committed to closing our recently announced sale of the Enterprise business. Our teams continue to make progress on a number of work streams to position that business for a smooth and seamless transition.","I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q2 results and our outlook, and then we'll return to provide additional thoughts and color on the quarter.","Gino A. Bonanotte","Thank you, Greg. Good morning. We reported revenue for the second quarter of 2014 of $1.4 billion, a decrease of 7% from last year. GAAP operating earnings were $138 million or 9.9% of sales. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $201 million or 14.4% of sales and operating cash flow was $118 million, an improvement of $140 million over the prior year quarter. On a GAAP basis, earnings from continuing operations were $0.30 per share compared to $0.81 per share in the second quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations were $0.47 per share compared to $0.94 in the year-ago quarter. That $0.47 difference was driven by the benefit from the formation of our international holding company in 2013. For the remainder of this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, unless otherwise noted.","Product sales in the quarter were $887 million, a decrease of 10% from the prior year. The biggest driver of the Q2 revenue decline was lower state and local sales in our North America region, which declined double digits year-over-year. Recall that state and local sales grew on average at double-digit rates over the prior 3-year period, which we believe is largely a reflection of the impact from narrowbanding activity over the past several years. Europe and Africa, as well as Latin America, grew double digits, with solid performance across most product lines. Asia Pacific turned in sales that were approximately $22 million lower year-on-year, primarily due to declines in Australia and China. Operating income in the Products segment was $133 million, down approximately $21 million to 15% of revenue, driven primarily by the impact of lower sales.","Turning to our Services segment. Services saw sales -- Services sales in Q2 were $506 million, a decrease of 1% from the prior year. This segment posted growth of 2% for the quarter when normalizing for iDEN. Approximately 2\/3 of iDEN sales are in the Services segment. We saw solid single-digit growth in both Managed Services and Integration services for the quarter. When excluding iDEN, all regions posted growth in Services, with the exception of Asia Pacific, Middle East, which was down slightly.","Operating income in the Services segment was $68 million, down approximately $26 million to 13.4% of revenue, driven primarily by lower iDEN sales. In addition, timing around certain of our largest long-term multiyear services projects unfavorably impacted gross margin by approximately $20 million in the quarter versus a favorable impact in the year-ago quarter. We expect that we will continue to see Services gross margin average in the mid-30s, which is generally consistent with past performance.","Total MSI operating expenses from continuing operations were $462 million, down $49 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by cost reduction initiatives during the second half of '13, as well as additional actions taken in the first half of this year. Another contributing factor to lower OpEx was lower incentive pay compensation expense during the quarter. Overall, we are down approximately $75 million in OpEx when comparing the first half of '14 with the same period in 2013. We spoke with you last quarter regarding our plans to sharpen our focus on cost reduction and reduced operating expenses by $200 million over 18 to 24 months, inclusive of $100 million this year. As Greg just mentioned, we are now expanding and accelerating those efforts to achieve approximately $300 million of cost savings by the end of next year. We now expect that overall 2014 OpEx will be down nearly $150 million, due primarily to lower incentive pay. This $300 million comes off the baseline of approximately $2 billion of OpEx for 2013, moving us to approximately $1.7 billion for 2015.","I'm encouraged by the work to date as we take a clean sheet approach to our structure, eliminating nonvalue-added work and simplifying processes across all aspects of the business, including G&A and R&D and sales and marketing. Some examples of areas where we've made progress during this past quarter includes streamlining G&A functions; workforce rebalancing, primarily in the engineering function; workforce reductions, including the Vice President level; and continued site consolidation across all regions. We will continue to keep you updated with respect to our progress and costs as we move through the year.","Shifting to other income and expense. This line item was a net expense of $40 million compared to a net expense of $35 million in the year-ago quarter. Interest expense was $29 million, and we incurred losses of another $4 million related to our investment portfolio during the quarter. We expect this line item to be comparable to this quarter for Q3 and Q4, primarily driven by quarterly interest expense. With respect to taxes. Our effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter, driven by benefits associated with the tax reserve, and undistributed foreign earnings. We expect our Q3 and Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%. We still expect our cash tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 15% for the full year 2014 and a cash tax rate of approximately 15% through 2019.","Turning to cash flow. Cash generated by operating activities in the second quarter was $118 million, a $140 million improvement from the prior year, primarily from improved collections and other improvement in certain working capital accounts. For the year, we expect operating cash flow from continuing operations of approximately $550 million. This outlook reflects the Enterprise transaction, increased restructuring costs, along with onetime items and our current outlook.","We ended Q2 with $2.9 billion in total cash and $2.5 billion in debt. With respect to capital return in Q2, we repurchased $416 million or approximately 6.2 million shares at an average price of $66.96 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, we also have increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% from $0.31 to $0.34 per share. We have approximately $1.3 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. Since the program's inception in the third quarter of 2011, we've reduced the net share count by 27% at an average price of $51.11 per share.","I'd now like to take a -- make a few comments on our Enterprise business, which is reflected in discontinuing operations. Enterprise revenues were $560 million for the quarter, a decline of $50 million over the prior year. The sales decline reflects some supply chain and IT execution issues related to transitioning business processes. Additionally, we saw weaker demand in Asia and the former Psion business. Excluding Psion, Europe and Africa and Latin America both posted growth in the quarter, while North America was down slightly. The company believes the supply chain modifications implemented in Q2 will benefit the business as it transitions to Zebra. Year-over-year backlog is up and in July, order activity has been robust, including several Android wins.","Now turning to our outlook. We expect sales for Q3 to decline 7% to 9%. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $0.35 and $0.41. As a reminder, Q3 2013 included a $0.35 benefit from the formation of our international holding company. For the full year, we continue to expect sales to decline low- to mid-single digits, excluding the decline in iDEN. I'll now turn it back to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown","Thanks, Gino. Now I'd like to provide some additional color on our outlook and the Q2 results for the Product and Services segments. Despite the expected revenue decline in North America this quarter, our Products segment grew double digits in Europe and Africa and Latin America, and our Services segment grew modestly on a worldwide basis when excluding iDEN.","Moving forward, the North America market is expected to recover in the second half of this year. Drilling deeper into our Products segment, our ASTRO P25 products performed as expected and are well positioned for the future, given the breadth and depth of our portfolio. Some key Q2 ASTRO wins include multiple North America state and local wins of over $10 million each; multimillion dollar contracts with the U.S. Armed Forces; 2 select Asia Pac first-responder agencies, totaling $15 million; and a notable $23 million contract in Latin America with the Ecuador Minister of Interior. We also had success beyond Public Safety with key wins in expanded verticals, including energy, petrochem and education.","Our TETRA product line continued its growth this quarter and built on its solid foundation, with key wins around the world. These include a major government system in Europe for over $17 million, a $6 million system with a Middle East railroad and a $15 million order in Asia. These awards include Public Safety, as well as other verticals in oil and gas, transportation and others, which follow on from our launch of a higher tier portfolio of TETRA radios at the end of 2013 that are proving popular with a diverse range of customers. Our recent professional and commercial radio or PCR wins continue to span multiple sectors, including U.S. automotive manufacturers, airlines, education and industrials. We continue to innovate across our PCR portfolio, having just launched the new C Series commercial digital radios in China. And finally, our Public Safety LTE leadership continues in the marketplace, with customer activities increasing around the world, driven by the breadth of our Products and Services portfolio. Our international engagement continues to grow and our progress in the U.S. with LA-RICS continues as we're proceeding with the first phase of the LA-RICS project worth approximately $50 million in revenue in the second half of this year. On the Products side, we announced the enhancement of our existing handset portfolio with the ruggedized LEX 755 mission-critical handheld for international customers and the VML 750 vehicular modem for U.S. customers as we continue to invest in the Public Safety LTE market.","Turning to Services. Our Services segment is healthy, with significant contract wins around the globe and across our portfolio. We continue to see positive trends toward our lifecycle management and support offerings. In Q2, these included maintenance in lifecycle services contracts for $19 million with Montgomery County, Maryland and a $19 million software upgrade with Butler County, Ohio. Internationally, we are in several multimillion dollar countrywide services agreements in Europe and Africa, including the Netherlands' MOI, while also winning several large contracts in APME covering a railway and a 5-year network management contract with Queensland Gas for over $8 million. We also have achieved some notable execution milestones in Q2, including the final acceptance of the $115 million 48-site P25 Phase 2 TDMA communication system serving 15,000 first responders for the city of Houston public safety communications network. Additionally, we and our local partner, Telstra, achieved commercial acceptance for the upcoming G20 finance summit in September and the G20 Leaders Summit in November. This is the first major milestone of this multistage P25 project.","Another area of focus is our smart public safety solutions, where our Services offerings are leading the market with targeted solutions such as our newly-announced Intelligent Data Portal. This innovative solution is network-agnostic, working across LMR technologies and\/or LTE networks to provide our customers with technology that is second nature, enabling them to focus on the job at hand. This solution is a software subscription model similar to a mobile app store, enabling our customers to access many types of applications and tailored services very specific to their needs in the field. We will continue to drive customer-focused services to meet and exceed the evolving needs of public safety.","Now having said all that, let me close with a few final thoughts on the business. First, overall market demand in North America was down in the first half, but we do expect it to show improvement for the second half of the year. Second, we're pleased with the launch of our stand-alone Services segment, and the Services business represents approximately 1\/3 of our overall sales and is gaining traction. You will see us continue to emphasize this business as we drive initiatives around managed and lifecycle services, as well as services related to public safety LTE. And finally, our team is fully committed to simplification and growth. We're focused on execution, cash generation, earnings growth, improving our culture, and closing the Enterprise transaction with Zebra. We're making good progress on the path to approximately $300 million in cost reductions as we take a clean sheet of paper approach to simplifying our processes and organization, and our team has several initiatives underway that we believe will drive future growth.","I'll now turn it over to Shep, and then we'll start the Q&A.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind our callers on the line how they can ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Tavis McCourt of Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First one is a clarification on the $1.7 billion of operating cost level. Is that a full year 2015 number or an estimate of where you'll exit 2015? And then secondly, obviously you guys must be expecting a much better trend in Q4 this year. And aside from the $50 million revenue rec on LA-RICS, what else in terms of large deals should we be thinking about in terms of driving that?","Gino A. Bonanotte","Okay. Tavis, I'll take -- this is Gino. I'll take the first part of the question. The $1.7 billion in OpEx for 2015 is the full year OpEx for 2015, not the exiting run rate.","Mark F. Moon","Tavis, I'll talk about Q4. This is Mark. Really, the Q4 and second half in Q4 story is exactly the same that we talked about on the Q1 earnings call. We knew when we provided second quarter guidance that we had to have a strong second half. We also talked about -- staged backlog that was going to require new orders to come into fruition throughout Q3 and the early part of Q4. We are in that same position. In fact, we talked about the pipeline being over $1 billion stronger in the second half than the first half. That pipeline has actually improved since our last earnings call. Visibility and the strength of that pipeline continues to improve. As you know, second quarter was slightly better than our expectations. And as we go into third quarter, we also believe that we will get additional orders that will build backlog as we enter into fourth quarter. So I would remind you, the other thing about kind of Q4. At the surface, the number that we're expecting for Q4 is very similar to last year. And in fact, we gave this kind of expectation last year and we executed on it. Our visibility to the pipeline is actually better this year than last year. We also have a couple of things working for us as we go into that. The comparable for our Federal business, as you know, which was down $150 million last year, is much better this year, so we expect growth in Federal. The iDEN decline will primarily be completed in the first 9 months, so we won't see any of that in Q4. The other thing is as we think about the overall business and what we've got to do from an orders perspective, we can see our way clear to exactly what large customers we've got to execute on. And as you mentioned, projects like LA-RICS, Libya, some additional revenues for large projects that are also already in our backlog but not yet logged like State of Maryland will help build revenue in Q4. So all in all, we're still in the same position, but actually with better visibility than we came in 3 months ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.","Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Greg, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about the impact from the difficult comps relative to narrowbanding in the last few years. And I think that's pretty well understood. But I was curious if you also think that there is some pause or confusion ahead of LTE deployments, which was a factor that one of your competitors cited. And then just from a recordkeeping perspective, if you can update us on what iDEN revenues were in the quarter and your expectations for next quarter for iDEN.","Gregory Q. Brown","Well, on iDEN, I know that the reduction in iDEN, Simona, in Q3 is about $25 million in Q3. Second is we do not see a chilling effect of LTE chilling LMR purchases. We do not see that. I recognize that there are some that believe that's the case. We have not seen any material evidence of that at all. We remain on the perspective that the down revenue in the first 9 months of this year is more the overhang of narrowbanding and to some degree, the shutdown of the iDEN network and Sprint. And in terms of the iDEN decline in the first half of the year...","Gino A. Bonanotte","The iDEN decline in Q2 specifically was $18 million compared to the $25 million that you stated for Q3.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum of Citigroup.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of questions. First of all, if I'm doing the math right on your top line guidance for next quarter, at the midpoint, I get $13.95, which is roughly flat with this quarter. But EPS guidance of $0.35 to $0.41 seems far below the $0.47 this quarter. So I'm guessing the mechanics, I'm guessing part of that is the tax rate. I'm wondering if it's all the tax rate or if there are other things that we should be taking into account -- operating income and other things like that or is it pretty much all the tax rate? And then you said that Q2 obviously was better than you expected. Can you give us a sense as to what was better? Was it just regionally, was subscriber better, subscriber units or infrastructure better? And do you think that any of that was pulled forward? Or was that an indication of strength returning in some of the regions? And then if you can just kind of quickly -- as a follow-up to the last question, LA-RICS is a perfect example of a place that's actually spending a lot on LTE in L.A. If you can give us a sense as to what L.A. as a city or municipality is doing on the LMR side right now -- just as a show point as to what happens to LMR spending when LTE gets underway, that would be great.","Gino A. Bonanotte","Ehud, this is Gino. I'll take the first part of the question. It is primarily tax that's driving the difference. Margin and OpEx, fairly consistent quarter-over-quarter. I will remind you that in OpEx last year in Q3, we had a year-to-date adjustment for incentive pay, so it's approximately flat quarter-over-quarter, up slightly actually in Q3 year-over-year. But it's primarily driven by tax. And Mark if...","Mark F. Moon","Yes. Ehud, the second quarter performance, as we said, slightly better than what the original guidance was, really driven by North America, which was a good thing. We had said that we needed to turn orders in North America. That was really the case, primarily infrastructure in services. But we are exiting Q2 with about $40 million of aged backlog in the second half of Product, which means we'll turn quicker. So that was really the reference to a little bit stronger in Q2. The other regions performed primarily as expected. If you think about the other question that you asked around LA-RICS, which is a wonderful example of what Greg said when we do not see a chilling effect of LTE. LA-RICS, as you know, we just mentioned that we're in the midst of implementing their Public Safety LTE network, of which approximately $50 million of revenue will be in the second half and a big continued ramp in next year to implement that full system. At the same time, we're also in the midst of implementing a brand new LMR contract. So for the city of L.A., L.A. County, all the independent cities, they're in the midst of upgrading to a P25 mission-critical voice system as well. So we're seeing that both here domestically and internationally, where we had talked about implementing our LTE system. They're also implementing a new voice system. So we do not see them as being one or the other. I think they're actually complementary around voice and data.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And when you gave guidance at the end of Q2 into the second -- end of Q1 into the second half of the year being stronger, did you expect at the time Q3 to be flat and then Q4 to be as strong as you're looking at now? Or did you expect it to be a little more even between the 2 quarters?","Mark F. Moon","Yes. I mean, we actually -- and that was kind of the comment I had made. We really are in the same place we were at that point of guidance. We expected to be able to execute on Q2, which we did. We knew that Q3 would still not be as strong as we expected, and we had a huge ramp in Q4. Obviously, pulling in orders into Q3 so that we exit Q3 with additional backlog, which we believe that we will, will be important. But we're really in the same position that we thought we were in at the end of Q1.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","As we -- it's kind of made me, for the outlook for the government order -- or with the old Government business, the product and multiservices there, as we get beyond the fourth quarter and look forward, is there any reason that you see why we couldn't go back to at least long-term growth rates in that business, based upon your order backlog or everything else? I take the point that there's been various issues this year in terms of comparisons, narrowbanding, pull forward of spend, all those things. I'm just trying to think, as we go forward now, you have the LTE opportunity, you can go with both the easier compares. Or is there a prolonged impact to anything else we should take into account on budgets?","Gregory Q. Brown","So it's a little bit tough to hear your question. Kulbinder, can you -- can I ask you to maybe speak up a little bit?","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sorry, yes. So my question was that as we get beyond this period now going to Q4 and beyond, my question is, do you still stand by the government business or the core business, if you like, can grow in the mid-single digits? Are the drivers in place there potentially for 2015 and beyond? I'm trying to think -- there's been various things this year that have weighed upon and distracted from what was a fairly healthy growing business and narrowbanding and everything else. Are all those kind of more or less behind us after Q3, do you think?","Gregory Q. Brown","So I think the answer is yes, that we still stand behind this business -- this core business to grow low- to mid-single digits. I think there are a number of things that will turn our way over time. Obviously, one is the year-over-year comps. Second is greater revenue density and contribution from Public Safety LTE. We mentioned $50 million of revenue in the second half of this year. That will grow nicely into next year with contracts that are in-hand that we have to then turn and complete. I think the narrowbanding will largely be behind us by the end of this year. And I also think that the product portfolio, some of the newer products. And quite frankly, the emphasis on Services with Bob Schassler here around lifecycle services, managed services, software maintenance agreements and some of the things that Moon is doing around geographic and vertical market expansion -- growth, Kulbinder, in areas beyond just Public Safety. And we've seen some of that already that as we've moved to a pure-play company, focused only on mission-critical communications, investing in the channel, redeploying and improving sales coverage in some international theaters, emphasizing North America commercial markets like some of the other verticals of oil and gas, manufacturing, I think will pay off. So we believe that this business can grow by low- to mid-single digits. We have the product portfolio, and the backlog position and the commitment around innovation to continue to distinguish ourselves going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu of Bernstein.","Pierre Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So first of all, an additional clarification on your cost cutting program. So could you, Greg, tell me -- tell us what you -- what happened to those last 3 months that led you to decide to step up your ambition from $200 million to $300 million? What's the additional opportunities you saw?","Gregory Q. Brown","So we've launched a pretty comprehensive effort led by one of our executives, Michael Annes, that we call simplify and grow. And as Gino referenced, we're taking a clean sheet of paper look at the company and say we don't look at what Motorola was. We look at what we need to be: sites, footprint, manufacturing, R&D, shared services, G&A. And as we dig into this, Pierre, further, we see other savings that can accrue to us so that we can turn around and invest and grow the company more sustainably going forward. With $75 million of savings already recorded in the first half through Q2, that's what caused us primarily to increase the $100 million target this year to approximately $150 million of this year. Now I remind you that a chunk of that is incentive pay benefits. But having said that, we'll still go after incremental G&A and other cost reductions worldwide that we think will be prudent and quite frankly, strengthen our competitiveness. So that's why we continue to dig deeper and see more efficiencies that are available to us, and we're going to capitalize on those and then reinvest surgically so capital is allocated and deployed in a way that makes the most sense for the shareholder.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Long of BMO Capital.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Two questions, if I could. Greg, maybe just drill down a little bit more on some of the other vertical opportunities. Just curious as to what you think the timing of some of those investments and focus will be. Are those type of revenue opportunities that we can see as meaningful in 2015? Or do you think it's got a bit longer tail than that? And then secondly, maybe Gino, a lot of good moves on the OpEx side there. Could you talk a little bit about some maybe incremental gross margin opportunities going forward maybe both on the Product and Service side? That would be great.","Gregory Q. Brown","On the other verticals, Tim, my commentary is really more around North America, although there are some internationally as well. I thought maybe, Mark, you can drill a little bit deeper into this -- some of the verticals that we've seen with Molloy and McNulty.","Mark F. Moon","Yes. So from an international basis, we've always been much more diverse in the split between Public Safety and additional verticals. In North America, we've been primarily focused on the North America Government business. One of the things we did with this new MSI and the divestiture of our Enterprise business was created a new go-to market team and a new focus within Jack Molloy's team in North America to really say, how do we get after the other commercial customers here? We want to continue to leverage our government customers, but we need to get broader in North America. And we're seeing immediate success, both in the automotive manufacturing -- we've had good success in several of those. Energy. If you think about petrochem, we've had a couple of big wins there. We think, even as you think about the Fortune 500, that we primarily were calling on with our Enterprise sales team but yet has applicability to our Government or our Products portfolio for Remainco. I think it's good to be a good opportunity for us to further expand into these other verticals as we go forward.","Gino A. Bonanotte","And Tim, from a gross margin perspective, it might be -- it's instructive to start a little bit and talk about Q2 gross margin. So the Q2 gross margin was impacted primarily by Services. And within Services, there were 2 large items: one, the decline in iDEN; and the second, an unfavorable adjustment to a large project in Q2. With respect to margins going forward, we clearly see improvement in the second half. And that's driven largely by revenue, by a much larger second half and particularly the mix that we expect to see towards North America. So that margin profile will improve. Also, it's important to note that ASPs are holding through this period. So the gross margin contraction that we're seeing is really a mix to services and volume-related. So we expect to see margin improvement in the second half as we mix back to a more normalized revenue structure, as well as product offerings in services in general -- increases -- as we increase software features and as we increase the number of our customers that are under our software maintenance agreement.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.","Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. One, I wanted to see if you guys could talk about your backlog. As it stands right now, I think you said $40 million of aged backlog addition. But what's the total backlog number exiting Q2? And then could you talk to us a little bit about how you expect backlog to continue through the second half of the year and how you might exit the year in terms of backlog? The other thing I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about, I just want to clarify an answer. Maybe, Greg, I think that you had said to a previous question, which was -- it sounded like you think you thought back in Q1 that consensus numbers in Q3 and Q4 were kind of mismodeled. Is that correct? I mean, do you think that the Street had numbers just too high for Q3 and not high enough for Q4? So could you just clarify that, that's what you guys are saying? That if you looked at your internal model, the Street was just mismodeling numbers on revenue, and that's it.","Gregory Q. Brown","Well, let me take the last one first. No, I didn't make comments on the Street's models. I think it was a question where Moon said a few minutes ago that he thought that we were -- to Ehud's question, that Q3 and Q4 were generally in the second half from our perspective expected to where we thought it would be. So product backlog was up, to your earlier question. Product backlog was up $42 million exiting Q2, and we expect to exit Q3 with product backlog to grow pretty substantially. At the end of the day, as Mark described, this is about order visibility and converting those orders within Q3 and Q4. But we -- clearly, we would expect product backlog to increase exiting Q3.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Spinola of Wells Fargo.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Could you put the second quarter Enterprise results in some context? Specifically, how much of the decline, the 8% decline, was sort of related to onetime issues versus normalized revenue growth? And maybe even more specifically, could you attribute the declines to some of the -- how it broke out between Asia, Psion and supply chain?","Gino A. Bonanotte","Okay. This is Gino. I'll take the first part of that question and maybe ask Mark to comment on the second part of it. As far as the makeup of the $50 million year-over-year contraction, it's approximately 50% related to execution, supply chain and IT issues, specific to business process improvements that we made in Q2. And about half of it demand-related, specifically in APME. Also important, as we noted, that July is off to a good start, with robust orders and several wins in Androids. And Mark, if you want to comment on the demand side.","Mark F. Moon","Yes. The -- from a demand perspective, it was really demand in Asia. And more specifically, Andrew, it was demand in China. I would remind you that last year in China, we actually had very strong double-digit growth in Enterprise, so coming from that perspective. This year, though, throughout the year, we've seen a decline in China in the Enterprise space throughout. Now with that said, the good news is the rest of the regions continue to perform really as expected, and we still anticipate growth for full year in all the other regions -- North America, Latin America, Europe and Africa.","Gino A. Bonanotte","And just one more note, Andrew. The improvements, the changes in Q2 are behind us. And they impacted Q2 and we don't expect them to recur.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So no impact to Q3 from the change?","Gino A. Bonanotte","No, no.","Operator","Our final question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","If I can just expand on Andrew a little bit. The -- some of the weakness in Asia, is -- do you think any of that pressure is coming from the threat from consumer devices? Or is that just from a macroeconomic development?","Mark F. Moon","So Keith, from an Enterprise perspective, I think it's really mostly macroeconomic environment. Obviously, the competitor base in Asia is a little bit different, while we see our traditional competitors, you see a lot more low-tier competitors as well. And I think, overall, the macroeconomics are impacting almost all businesses in Asia. When we think about our existing or the new Motorola Solutions, I would say the Asia market has really been slower to recover or return to growth than we expected. But it's primarily 2 issues: it's China and it's Australia, this year. And when you think about China, what you just said from a, if you will, new business perspective, it's really the localization pressures that we still have. There's a new standard in China called PDT. Fortunately for us, we were admitted to the PDT alliance last month, so we expect to successfully compete in that business as we go forward, but we had been shut out prior to that. In Australia, it's a little different. It's really around the economy, the pressure FX-wise against the dollar, as well as the declining minerals and energy market, the mining industry, which has been a boom the last few years. In Australia, our business is always over-indexed. And this year, we're down 25%, and we're down almost 10% in China through the half. Now the rest of Asia is actually up. So again, we're making good progress. And in Australia in particular, we also have several large projects that we expected to get earlier in the year that we expect now to receive orders for before the end of the year, almost $200 million. And that business then we'll exit as we go forward. So Enterprise, all in all, is responding well throughout the world. It's responding well in Asia. China, in particular, has been the issue.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","Got you. And then just overall, you -- it sounds like you have some optimism for growth for the year. Can you speak to the backlog and where it stands now versus where it was, I guess, this time last year?","Mark F. Moon","So from our new MSI, we were in the worst backlog position in the...","Gregory Q. Brown","I think he's asking Enterprise.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","Yes, Enterprise, I'm sorry.","Gino A. Bonanotte","Yes. Enterprise backlog is up. Product backlog, specifically, is up significantly.","Operator","I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks.","Shep Dunlap","Thank you.

With me this morning are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Ed Fitzpatrick, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mark Moon, Executive Vice President, Sales and Field Operations. Greg and Ed will review our second quarter results along with commentary, and Mark will join us for Q&A.","We have posted an earnings presentation and press release at www.motorolasolutions.com\/investor. These materials also include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. As always, it's important for you to review these materials.","A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation.

These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of Motorola Solutions, and we can give no assurance that any future results or events discussed in these statements will be achieved.","Any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements contained in this presentation.","And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown","Thanks, Shep. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Q2 highlighted another strong quarter for Motorola Solutions as we delivered strong sales growth and operating leverage, resulting in excellent earnings growth. In addition, we continue to place a high priority on the return of capital to shareholders through our quarterly dividend and share repurchase program.","This morning, we reported record second quarter sales of $2.1 billion, which represents an increase of 8% from Q2 of last year. On a GAAP basis, net earnings were $0.60 per share from continuing operations compared to $0.14 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations were $0.70 per share compared to $0.54 per share in Q2 of last year, which represents a 30% increase. For the remainder of this call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise noted.","Our Government business revenues increased 14%, a record second quarter. This reflects broad-based growth across all of our regions driven by a combination of factors, including core market growth, new product introductions and narrow banding in the United States. Operating margins in the Government business improved 330 basis points year-over-year to 16.4% due to the sizable growth in sales across our portfolio coupled with our continued focus on cost management.","In our Enterprise business, sales declined 2% from the year-ago quarter, including an anticipated iDEN decline. We've seen this business impacted by a number of factors, including most notably a tougher macroeconomic environment, especially within Europe, coupled with foreign currency headwinds.","Let me spend a moment on capital allocation. During Q2, we paid $64 million in dividends and repurchased $439 million in stock, bringing the total repurchase amount to $2.9 billion since the program was announced approximately 12 months ago. One year ago, we initiated a dividend, authorized a repurchase program and introduced a capital allocation framework. Today, I'm pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.26 per share, an increase of 18%. In addition, our board has increased our share repurchase authorization by $2 billion, bringing the total to $5 billion.","These announcements reflect the continued confidence we have in our business, as well as our earnings growth and cash flow generation opportunities. Ed will speak more on this topic later in the call. I'll now turn it over to Ed Fitzpatrick to discuss our financial results in more detail. I'll then return to discuss operational highlights and provide additional commentary and perspective on our overall business performance.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Thanks, Greg. Q2 was another strong quarter of earnings growth and cash flow generation for MSI. Along with revenue growth of 8%, our focus on operating leverage yielded an increase in operating earnings of 15% compared to last year, despite an $11 million increase in U.S. regular pension expense and $20 million of unfavorable FX impact to operating margins. The unfavorable FX impact was driven primarily by the weakening euro.","We saw broad-based revenue growth in our Government business with record second quarter sales of $1.5 billion, an increase of nearly 14% from the prior year. Operating margins in the Government business improved 330 basis points from 13.1% to 16.4%. This leverage was driven by strong sales growth and our continued focus on cost management.","Enterprise sales declined 2% to $689 million. Operating margin in the Enterprise business declined 340 basis points. The margin decline was primarily attributable to changes in sales mix along with foreign currency headwinds.","Turning to earnings. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.70 per share compared to $0.54 per share a year ago, a 30% increase. Operating expenses were $721 million or 33.6% of revenue, which represents a 210-basis-point improvement from the year-ago quarter. Our operating earnings for the second quarter were $350 million, or 16.3% of sales, compared to $304 million, or 15.3%, in Q2 of 2011.","Total other income expense was a net expense of $38 million in the quarter compared to a net expense of $17 million in Q2 2011. The largest driver of the year-over-year increase in this line was a result of significant devaluation of a number of currencies versus the dollar, most notably the euro. This negatively impacted the quarter by $21 million compared to Q2 of last year. In addition, we incurred a $6 million loss associated with the early debt repayment made in June. Going forward, we expect this line item to be a net expense of approximately $20 million to $25 million, which includes incremental interest expense associated with the net increase in our debt levels during the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 33.1% for the quarter. For full year 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to be 34% to 35%.","Cash flow from operations was $254 million during the quarter, driven by strong operating earnings and solid working capital management. With respect to working capital, inventory management continued to improve, and we achieved 8.9 turns compared to 7.5 in the year-ago quarter. I'm also pleased with our receivable balance, as it continued to decline from Q1, driven by improved collection days and the continued liquidation of certain notes receivable we retained from the Networks business we sold last year. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and investments and approximately $1.9 billion in debt, a net increase of $350 million in long-term debt from the prior quarter. We issued $750 million of new debt with a coupon of 3.75% and retired $400 million of notes due in November.","As Greg mentioned, we purchased $439 million in stock during the quarter, which brings us to over $2.9 billion in share repurchases since the inception of our plan. We reduced our share count by approximately 19% since the start of the program a year ago with the purchase of 63.7 million shares at an average price of $45.80. In addition, we paid $64 million in dividends during the quarter. Year to date, we\u2019ve returned over $1.9 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.","We have shared with you our clear set of priorities with respect to capital return and allocation. One of those priorities is moving to a net debt position by the end of 2014. With that as background, I would like to now discuss the capital return announcement that Greg referenced earlier.","Today we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share. This represents an 18% increase over the prior quarterly dividend. We also announced that our board has authorized an increase of $2 billion to our share repurchase program. With respect to our long-term capital allocation framework, we believe the current mix that we initially outlined is still appropriate based on our capital needs and goals. This mix is to allocate 25% of operating cash flow to capital expenditures, 30% to dividends and 45% to a combination of share repurchases and acquisitions.","Now turning to our Q3 and full year outlook. For Q3, we expect sales growth of approximately 3% over the third quarter of 2011. Our outlook is for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69 to $0.74 from continuing operations based on our Q2 ending share count. This compares to non-GAAP EPS in Q3 2011 of $0.66 per share. Consistent with prior quarters, this outlook excludes stock-based compensation and intangible amortization expenses of approximately $0.12 per share and items historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings releases.","Moving to full year 2012. We are now increasing our outlook from approximately 5% to 5% to 6% growth with operating margins remaining at approximately 17% of revenue. This overall outlook assumes the euro at current rates. We now expect full year growth for Government to be upper single digits, while Enterprise growth for the year is now estimated to be relatively flat. This revised Enterprise segment view, which is inclusive of the anticipated iDEN decline, accounts for a more challenging macro environment along with the FX headwinds we have mentioned. I'll now turn it over to Greg for business highlights from the quarter.","Gregory Q. Brown","Ed, thanks. In our Government business, sales for the quarter were $1.5 billion, an increase of 14% over Q2 2011. We saw strong growth in all regions. Profitability also improved with operating earnings growing to 16.4% of sales this quarter compared to 13.1% in Q2 of last year.","We've talked previously about some of the growth drivers for public safety that include interoperability, spectrum efficiency and compelling return on investment. Customers are seeking to overcome spectrum constraints by selecting our latest version of ASTRO 25 with P25 Phase 2, which is nearly twice as efficient as required by the current FCC narrow band mandate in the United States. For example, Apopka, Florida recently celebrated the world's first deployment and acceptance of a dual-mode ASTRO 25 system with Phase 2 P25 TDMA. They doubled their channel capacity for secure, encrypted communications without the need for adding frequency bands, antenna sites or stations.","And our APEX radios provide multiband functionality in one device, allowing first responders the freedom to seamlessly connect between multiple frequencies for interoperability between agencies, improved mobility and response time.","Another example of a Phase 2 TDMA system that's being deployed is Maryland's First Responder Interoperable Radio System Team, or Maryland FiRST, as it's known, a statewide 700 megahertz radio communication system designed for state and local public safety officials to communicate with each other on a common system. And this quarter, the city of Toronto selected our ASTRO technology with Phase 2 TDMA for a 700 megahertz shared police, fire and EMS system implementation.","Other significant ASTRO wins from this quarter include the state of Ohio for $80 million, Lakeland, Florida for $12 million, state of Pennsylvania police for $10 million and Centre County Pennsylvania for $13 million. In Latin America, our ASTRO solution was selected by the Chilean Investigative Police to cover the entire country with both trunking and conventional mode. We also sold a $37 million ASTRO system to Ecuador's National Telecommunications Corporation for the National Police.","In May, we participated in TETRA World Congress in Dubai where we introduced the MTP3000 handheld radio, which redefines mission-critical performance with superior audio quality and improved coverage. A TETRA-equipped version of our vision for the ultimate police patrol vehicle demonstrated the latest technologies and integrated controls to enable streamline decision making. In China, we were awarded a $3 million TETRA system with Beijing Metro and a multimillion TETRA contract for the Mass Transit Railway in Hong Kong. The London Underground recently chose Motorola Solutions TETRA equipment for a $6 million system expansion as well.","Among our integrated command-and-control applications portfolio, Randall County, Texas contracted with us for a $2 million advance computer-aided dispatch solution that uses GPS to enable dispatchers to locate officers and vehicles, while officers can run license checks from their patrol car without calling dispatch. This solution also incorporates a public safety LTE network and expands the LTE core, which is owned by Harris County, Texas.","The evolution of public safety LTE in the U.S. continues as first net and the related D Block governance structure takes form. As we've said before, we do not anticipate material revenues from LTE until the back half of 2013. Meanwhile, the market for Public Safety LTE is global as the tools and capabilities from this vital technology benefit public safety responders and citizens. This quarter, we launched a trial with the Brazilian Army, and in May, nearly 1,000 government officials and customers gathered in Tel Aviv for a showcase to explore the benefits of public safety LTE by Motorola Solutions. In addition, we've seen continued interest and activity from several countries in the Middle East.","In our professional and commercial radio tier, double-digit growth continued. We also expanded our industry-leading MOTOTRBO series with the release of the XPR 7000 and XPR 3000 series digital portables designed to meet the communication needs of public service, manufacturing, education, hospitality and service industries. These new radios add to a growing family of devices, giving customers a choice of different form factors and feature sets as seen in the ultra-thin and lightweight SL Series portable and the XPR 5000 Series mobile, which both launched earlier this year.","Moving on to our Enterprise business, sales in the Enterprise segment were $689 million, a 2% decrease from Q2 of 2011. Operating earnings were 16% of sales compared to 19.4% last year. In June, we announced a $200 million cash offer to acquire Psion, another pioneer in the rugged mobile computing industry. Psion works directly with its customers and partners to also develop mobile computing hardware, software and services that meet their specific rugged mobile computing needs. The acquisition of Psion will allow us to strengthen our portfolio with ruggedized handheld products and vehicle-mount terminals and deepen our presence in the global markets in which we compete. The acquisition also supports our international growth strategy by providing an attractive global base of customers. Psion brings a talented team with extensive mobile computing design expertise and professionals with key industry experience, and we expect this transaction to close in Q4.","We also hosted events in Boston and New York to share our view on the future of retail. Drawing from our deep domain expertise and world-class portfolio, we framed a vision where retailers will rely on advanced solutions to control the path to purchase and turn browsing into buying and shoppers into brand advocates. During the events, we previewed new devices like the SB-1 wearable smartbadge, which includes a personalized task manager, scanner and push-to-talk voice capability, along with the MC40, a sleek, customizable touchscreen solution that runs on Android and offers enterprise class durability, secure payment processing and powerful voice connectivity.","Notable wins in the Enterprise for the quarter included a $2 million order from Tesco, which includes our MC17 devices and personal shopping system and a $3 million CVS purchase of wireless LAN infrastructure for their stores. The U.K. Mail Group, the largest independent parcel mail and logistics company in the U.K., selected our global services team for a $2 million contract to manage 2,000 devices with asset tracking, software upgrades and security management.","Our industry leadership was recognized by Gartner with a strong positive evaluation in their market scope report for the ruggedized handheld computer market, noting several areas including devices for harsh environments, specific market solutions and vertical solutions and new task-specific devices.","We also hosted over 160 developers from across the Americas where we announced new investments for our developer community as part of the PartnerEmpower program. Attendees learned how to architect next-generation solutions using our latest tools, platforms, products and technologies, including the RhoMobile Suite 2.0, our latest tool for applications developers, which has been downloaded over 20,000 times.","Turning to a regional view for the total company. North America and Latin America both grew by 10%, driven by robust demand in Government. EMEA grew 5% with double-digit growth in Government. Growth in Asia of 5% was balanced across both Government and Enterprise segments.","So in closing, I'd like to thank our 21,000 employees globally for their focus on providing solutions to our customers. Q2 was another very good quarter for Motorola with strong growth, continued operating leverage and additional capital returns to shareholders. While we're pleased with these results, we remain clearly focused on execution, investing in new products and solutions, increasing our top line, earnings growth, free cash flow generation and return of capital.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind our callers how to place a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Peter Misek with from Jefferies.","Peter Misek - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a question on R&D. Obviously, as we have LTE ramping, we've had R&D investments. You've invested well in front of that, as you have with previous major network changes. Can you walk us through how we should think about R&D for the next few quarters? Can we see R&D level off and maybe even come down as a percentage of sales? And are there any sort of more temporal-type expenses there that we could see managed as we see the shift happening?","Gregory Q. Brown","I just think that you'll see us continue to focus on cost management overall as we look forward for the second half of the year. In terms of R&D, we've talked in the past that we would expect R&D and G&A and other major functions on an annual basis to typically trend and improve from a leverage standpoint as a lower percentage against revenue. So when we look at below gross margin costs against overall revenues, we would expect to be able to continue to get improvement year-over-year.","Peter Misek - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And if I can just sneak a follow-up on the capital structure comments you made about going net debt position by 2014. Can you help us understand the process that you and the board are going through to think about what the appropriate capital structure is? What are you benchmarking? How should we look at that evolution? Are we going to look at a reverse auction for buybacks?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","So Peter, I think the strategy is really just a continuation of what we outlined last year with the capital allocation model, a piece described, the dividend, 30%; 25% to CapEx; and that 45% to share repurchase and\/or acquisitions. So I think that hasn't changed. The other key tenet is that the capital structure, really, will be driven off of an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA metric of around 2 such that the debt levels will be calculated based upon our ability to bear and our improvements in EBITDA. So I think that's really the way we're looking at it and the way we're modeling it going forward.","Operator","Next, we will go to the site of Jeff Kvaal with Barclays.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Could you go into a little bit more into the change in the revenue picture a little bit? I think as we cycle back a couple of quarters, certainly the Enterprise outlook was a little bit brighter. Could you help us understand that a little bit better? I think, secondly, 3% year-over-year growth is sort of not what\u2019s been in the range of the target model over the past couple of years. Could you help us understand what is happening in that quarter in particular and then why the December quarter would be better?","Gregory Q. Brown","So just a couple of things, Jeff. As we look to the remainder of the year, we now expect the Government segment to grow in the upper single digits and Enterprise to be relatively flat, of course, including iDEN for the year. I think the moderation in the update in Enterprise is a reflection of the macroeconomic conditions, particularly in Europe, as well as the foreign currency headwinds. Enterprise actually grew in all other regions. If you look at Q3 and you look at our revenue guidance of 3%, I remind you that a year ago, our Q3 comp of last year was an exceptionally strong quarter overall at 10%, so that's one factor to consider. We expect continued decline in the iDEN business in Q3 of approximately $20 million. And we expect the headwinds around foreign currency in Q3 to be about approximately $30 million of top line. So when you think through the previous year comps, you incorporate the continued decline of iDEN and then the incremental headwinds of foreign currency led by the euro. Those are the ingredients that factor in. Now having said that, we're still raising full year revenue guidance from about 5% to 5% to 6%. And we'll continue to manage our costs closely and look to get continued improvement in leverage over the next few quarters.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Jeff, you also asked, I think, a question about linearity or seasonality in the quarter. I heard you say something about Q4. So as we\u2019ve talked about before, as our quarters progress, Q1 is typically always the lowest quarter. We step function up to Q2. Q3 is usually typically in line with Q2, sometimes up, sometimes down. And then we typically do step function up in Q4 from a seasonality perspective.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And that $20 million to $30 million impact that you referenced, Greg, that is year-over-year impact or sequentially?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Yes. I think Greg talked about the top line about $30 million -- $30 million top line impact for Q3. But I'd say it's $30 million to $35 million, and that contemplates us in and around the current euro exchange rate of $1.21 today.","Gregory Q. Brown","But it's year-over-year.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Year-over-year, yes, that's right.","Operator","Next, we will go to the site of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you guys could talk about some of the backlog statistics that you talked about on the last call for Enterprise and Government. And then a quick one for you, Ed, on -- I think there was a writer on the highway bill that had some impact to pension fund accounting. And wondering if you can run us through the impact, if you know yet, on your pension fund issues.","Mark F. Moon","So if we look, Tavis, at our Q2 backlog, it's roughly $5.9 billion, which is down about $100 million from what we discussed last quarter. Government, relatively flat. And Enterprise was down. When we normalize for FX, really, the backlog was basically flat. So as we look at it, I think we're not surprised by the decline in Enterprise as we've seen pressure there, but we still feel fairly confident about our visibility and as we look at our guidance going in the quarter. So relatively speaking, backlog has remained consistent to slightly down.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","And on the pension piece, Tavis, as you know, and I saw your note on it, I think you had it right. The change in the calculation of the discount rate should lead to a higher discount rate, which would lead to a lowering of the required annual cash funding. So that's something that we would look at and contemplate if that makes sense strategically going forward to close the funding deficit. Also included in the bill are some PBGC fees that are scheduled to go up starting in 2014. So we're going to assess all that in line with the overall strategies on pension as we go forward here, and we'll come back to you later in the year with our plans to address.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great. And did you talk about an Enterprise number x iDEN?","Gregory Q. Brown","No. What I was just commenting earlier that Enterprise was up outside of Europe and the regions. Without iDEN, it was up slightly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the site of Jasmeet Chadha with Bernstein.","Jasmeet Chadha","I had a question on Enterprise. So it dropped about 20% in 2009, which was clearly an exceptional year. What sort of downside could we expect this time in a worst-case scenario? And if you are worried today on what you're seeing into the second half and what kind of measures would you take if there was a pronounced weakness? And then a follow-up on Government. So where does the strength today in the Government revenues come from? And is there reason that we should worry that it could snap back in 2013?","Gregory Q. Brown","So I'll take the last part of that 3-parter first on Government. Obviously, we're very pleased with the record Q2 of 14%. If we look at the growth of that and what makes it up, I would say 11% of the 14% are coming more or less from half of our core market growth, which includes continued expansion in both North America and international and the other half from a continued investment in R&D that has allowed for the expansion of new products and innovation. And probably 3% as best our estimate of the 14% is driven by narrow banding here in the U.S. Now that said, we typically usually have structural drivers that continue to require our customers to upgrade and invest, whether it's in the prior periods. Years ago, it was Nextel re-banding. It continues to be analog to digital, not only here under the narrow banding mandate in the U.S., but the drive for analog to digital internationally. There'll be some number of customers that won't meet the narrow banding mandate by the end of the year, so they'll continue to invest in more spectrum-efficient radios and mobiles and infrastructure. And then also, as you know, there's a number of aged customer installations that are there throughout North America and in other geographies that we will look to migrate and upgrade accordingly. So if you look at the 14%, our best estimate is that 3% of the 14% is narrow banding in the U.S., but 11% is still very strong, driven by core market growth and the expansion of our new products. In terms of Enterprise, I'll let Mark say a few words.","Mark F. Moon","Yes. So if you think about Enterprise, clearly, I think Ed highlighted before, as we think about the year, and we have guided now to relatively flat, it is down from what we've traditionally seen and what we have said as expectations. Now with that said, I would say it's primarily macroeconomic driven because we have held ASPs and we believe we've held market share in all of our categories, at least all of our major categories with the possible exception of wireless LAN. The other piece that I would say around Enterprise again, as Greg mentioned, was the growth in every region still gives us somewhat confidence when you say without iDEN. And even in Europe that was only slightly down, I would remind you that the previous year, the growth in Europe for Enterprise was 39%. So again, I think given the headwinds that we've got there, the Enterprise business has held. So as we go forward, we'll continue to monitor it, continue to give you guidance. But all in all, I feel pretty pleased with the way we've held and the way we performed and continue to monitor it as we go forward.","Jasmeet Chadha","Sure. Just one follow-up on that. So when you say that regionally Enterprise was strong or up year-on-year outside of Europe, is that x iDEN? Or is that including iDEN?","Mark F. Moon","That's correct. What we've mentioned here was x IDEN.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Without iDEN. I mean, I think the one big region there is Latin America. So I think his comment is correct. I mean, I think that Mark may have mentioned it, but I think in Europe, we talked last quarter that it was -- that Enterprise was down, primarily driven by FX. Otherwise, it was relatively flat. This quarter, it was down due to FX. We actually were up net of the FX, right? So it was -- I think we're holding our own in EMEA.","Operator","We will next go to the site of Craig Hettenbach with Goldman Sachs.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Greg, just following up on the revised revenue guidance, 5% to 6%, anything else you can touch on in backlog or just visibility this quarter versus a quarter ago? I know you mentioned narrow banding, but any other things that gives you confidence to nudge the growth rate up a little bit?","Gregory Q. Brown","Well, I would say just generally our visibility levels remain unchanged, Craig, which I think is good news. We're just trying to have the guidance reflective of the macro conditions under which we're competing. But as Mark referenced, backlog normalized for foreign exchange was relatively flat. And we're focused to execute on Q3 and knowing that 3%, while it doesn't sound fantastic when you look at the subcomponents and the ingredients and compare it to a very strong comp previous, I think we'll continue to perform as we expect. And we'll manage all the levers available to us, and we're not confused in terms of what needs to be done.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, Ed, just a follow-up on the buyback. In the press release, it said no expiration date. Anything to read into there versus the prior programs where you had it out kind of 18 months or so?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","No, I think it's -- Greg can add. I think our coming out of the gate as the separate public entity MSI, we thought it was appropriate to have an end date there to ensure that everyone knew, investors and also like -- that we had a sense of urgency on return of capital to shareholders. We think we've demonstrated that. We will continue with the program and be deliberate over a timeline here but also be opportunistic as we were in prior periods. So I think we're going to get at it, as you guys have seen us do in the past, and we'll continue to execute.","Operator","Our next question comes from the site of Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions. First of all, Greg, if we look at the Government side, the guidance for the full year of upper single digits for Government, you did 11.5% growth in Q1 and 13.6% in Q2. So to get to upper single digits for the year, that would imply a huge deceleration in Q3 and Q4, somewhere in the order of 3% or 4% year-over-year for those 2 quarters. Why would you think that is kind of factoring into your guidance? Putting aside the Enterprise side of the business, I just think Government -- why is this falling down so much? Does this have to do with narrow banding? Does it have to do with macro? And kind of just understanding that a little better. And then, Ed, just I want to understand a little bit more about the FX. And I heard but I may have misunderstood, the $25 million below-the-line expense that shows up in the P&L, is that hedging? Is that where the FX impact is? Or is that kind of sprinkled throughout the earnings statement? And how do we account for FX kind of going forward?","Gregory Q. Brown","Ehud, on the first part, look, I just think that we've had fantastic growth, obviously, records in Q1 and Q2. We're just being a little bit more tempered. We know that Q3 as a comp was higher, as I mentioned. We have some incremental headwinds, as do many other companies, around foreign currency. I just think we're being cautious. And in this environment, while we're confident of the business and confident as ever in the product portfolio and the underlying drivers, it just -- I think we think it makes sense to be a little bit more cautious now.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Does FX impact the revenue? Or does it impact this below-the-line kind of...","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","It's a combination of both. So if I talk about Q2, we talked about, about $20 million of impact to operating margins as a result of the decline, largely driven by the euro. The top line growth impact there was about $30 million, and the margin impact was about 20, right? So if you look into Q3, there was also a bottom -- there was also below operating earnings related charges. You mentioned about $20 million. That was driven by balance sheet -- the fluctuation in the foreign currency and the net unhedged positions caused about a $20 million impact as we moved for the quarter. If we move into Q3, I'd say you should expect relatively similar impact, and our guidance contemplates that, for the operating margin piece. I'd say the piece below operating earnings, the other income expense, should be significantly less than that in the third quarter.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So if I got that right, there was a $30 million impact to revenue from FX this quarter, $20 million to OpEx? Or to operating margin?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","That's right. Operating margin.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So that means there was a $10 million gain from OpEx that offset the $30 million, part of the $30 million revenue?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","I'm not sure where you\u2019re going -- we could take it offline in the reconciliation with you.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So the net impact was $20 million to operating income and $20 million below the line?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","That's right.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And you\u2019re saying, next quarter, assume another $20 million to operating income, most of which comes in the revenue line, which is where Greg's conservatism comes from the Government side, and then less below the line?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","That's right. That's right, Ehud.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. A couple other things. Why are taxes going up? And did you guide 34% to 35% for the back half of the year? Or did you guide that for the full year? And then did you -- I'm not sure if you said how big iDEN was this quarter and what it is in your guidance for Q3.","Gregory Q. Brown","What was the second part of that question, Ehud?","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Taxes. They were 33% this quarter. You're guiding 34% to 35%. And I wasn't sure if that was, again, for the full year or for next quarter. And then how big iDEN was.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","So the guidance was really, for the full year, still around 34% to 35%. So that hasn't changed. And what we're figuring there, too, is the R&D tax credit, right? So if that does come through, it will be at the lower end. If it doesn't, it will likely be at the higher end.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But you had a low -- you had a 33.3% this quarter. So 34% to 35% for the year, we're talking about 35% to 36% for Q3 and Q4?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","I think there were discrete items and there's timing-related items that are driving that. So I think that\u2019s -- as you forecasted, you should forecast something at 34% to 35% for the full year. So a bit higher in the second half.","Gregory Q. Brown","And Ehud, in terms of iDEN, it's in line pretty much with our expectations in terms of the continued decline for the year 2012. We're now tracking for iDEN to be about $270 million in revenue for the year.","Operator","The next question comes from the site of Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My first question is a clarification, and I'll just ask my follow-on immediately after that. But for the clarification, for the outlook, am I correct it does not include acquisition revenues of Psion in your outlook? And then my follow-up question is can you just help investors and us bridge the gap between your strong outlook and results compared to the budgetary constraints that we're seeing and the workforce reductions? We know that the First Responders is a priority, but definitely we're seeing when the police and firemen retire, the various teams are replacing them with less people rather than more. Can you just kind of help us understand that? And then on the outside, is it just basically it's more sticky business? And if so, when we come into a more favorable economy, does that just mean Motorola Solutions may not see quite the upside? Or how can we think about -- can\u2019t be heads you win, tails you win also. Also, help us understand and connect those.","Gregory Q. Brown","So in order of your questions. You're right. Psion is not included in our second half guidance. The transaction is not closed yet. We're anticipating that to be, Jim, in Q4. Second, we continue to operate under the constraints of austerity, if you will, with governments across the world. But interestingly, and you've seen the Government post 14% in Q2, our segment, our state and local business in particular, is really strong. And I think that's a reflection on, we've talked about it before, the prioritization of mission-critical public safety, the deployment of additional technologies beyond just radios, whether it's video surveillance or integrated command-and-control or dispatch software or other kinds of technology deployments that make First Responders more productive. It's a continued reflection on the high return on investment of what we sell. Remember, with all of this, there's no usage associated on a private network as these devices and subscriber units get deployed, unlike a cellular system that has per-minute charges. There is no usage cost at all. And of course, the durability and reliability and long installed base of 10, 15, sometimes north of 20 years, all lend themselves positively as drivers for First Responders to prioritize this. I think your last comment is also correct that what we have found with our business overall is that it's stable. It is sticky and, we believe, largely sustainable. And oftentimes, our installed base and our incumbency allow us to continue the relationships with clients and allow us the dialogue to add equipment and upgrade and refresh and sell new solutions on top of the relationships and systems we have, and we think that's a good position to be in.","Operator","The next question comes from the site of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","Gentlemen, can you just shed a little bit of light on what you're seeing in Asia? I see 5% growth year-over-year. It\u2019s probably a little bit lower, I guess, than I anticipated, and I know it's an area of focus for you guys. But what are you seeing in Asia perhaps as driving a little bit slower growth than what you guys have shed in the past few quarters?","Mark F. Moon","Keith, I do agree with your comment that our growth in Asia, while we talked about kind of mid-single digits for both Enterprise and Government, is less than, number one, what we've been producing in the past and also what we've said was expectations for Asia. With that being said, I also think though the primary drivers, as we look at the business, was really around the systems and the timing of the systems and project business there as we think about what's going forward. So China did slow to mid-single digits. Again, we had not seen that kind of growth in China. We traditionally have expected China to be stronger. But for the full year, we still anticipate that Asia Pac will be double-digit growth, and we expect China to be strong double-digit growth for the year. So we're still very opportunistic and very -- I guess we view Asia still as a strong growth area for us as we look to go forward.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","Okay. Great. And then finally, as you guys exited the quarter, were there any changes in the business that you saw in, I guess, the previous 2 months that give you pause or give you some consideration to your activity going into 3Q?","Gregory Q. Brown","That gives us -- what was the last part? Anything you want to...","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","That gives you pause going into the third quarter.","Gregory Q. Brown","Not really, no. As I mentioned earlier, I think our visibility has remained reasonably consistent. We've moderated to adjust for the segment, Government being a little bit stronger than we thought, anticipating and managing the Enterprise headwinds mainly out of Europe and macroeconomic and with foreign currency. I mean, obviously, foreign currency was the one in the last 30 to 45 days where the euro dropped pretty sharply from $1.32 or $1.31 to $1.22. So we certainly didn't anticipate that. But that's, as Ed talked about, the guidance for the second half, for Q3 and Q4, assumes the euro at about $1.21. So we think we've incorporated that in accordingly.","Operator","Next, we will go to the site of Tim Long with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Two questions, if I could. First, on the Enterprise side particularly. Can you talk a little bit about Windows and the transition to Windows 8 and what do you think that will mean for the Enterprise customer base? Is there a risk that on top of the macro risks there's some potential product transition as Windows develops? And then secondly, Greg, if you could just -- you mentioned visibility the same, but I'm just curious if you could scale for us how with the bigger ramp in Q4 that you're looking for, how would you compare your Q3 and your Q4 visibility right now? Does it drop off where you have a much lower confidence in it? Or if you can just scale for us the difference between looking out that extra quarter.","Gregory Q. Brown","What was the first part of your question, Tim?","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Windows 8 and just impact on Enterprise business.","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes, so we -- our mobile computing portfolio in all products is supported by Microsoft with the exception of our rugged tablet, the ET1, which came out with Android. We did that because the operating system that was required was a touch-based OS, and Microsoft is in the middle of transition. The majority of our Microsoft product is Windows 6.5.3 or Windows Embedded Handheld. And we\u2019re anxiously enthusiastic about Windows Phone 8. That's got to get into the market in October and then needs to be incorporated with the appropriate enterprise features, enterprise class features that would make it attractive for us. So we've always been Microsoft. We've diversified in Android because of the requirements of our clients and the feature set that they need. I would expect us to continue to engage in both going forward. But I am cautiously optimistic that we can work more closely with Microsoft than Win Phone 8, and we'll see when it ships and what feature sets in there. And we'd like to work collaboratively with them on a joint roadmap for clients, especially on the deployment of that OS, the developer ecosystem and the individual feature sets that required for a durable Enterprise grade set of devices.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. I guess my question, Greg, is, is there a risk that customers pause spending because they want Windows 8 instead of 6.5?","Gregory Q. Brown","I don't think so. I don't think so because our customers are different than the consumer. So they have customized software apps on 6.5 or Windows Embedded. And I don't think there's a risk of that, that we see at this point. On visibility, I've talked about, Tim, that in any given quarter, we have about roughly 80% visibility into that quarter going in. I would say that remains the same for Q3 and is incorporated into the guidance we've given you here at 3% revenue growth all in and $0.69 to $0.74 per share on EPS.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. I guess the question -- if it's $0.80 for this quarter, what is it for another quarter out?","Gregory Q. Brown","We don't really get into that. So we're not that [indiscernible] into that.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","It drops off a bit, right.","Operator","Next we will go to the site of Kulbinder Garcha with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Greg, I just want to go back to the narrow banding issue. You say if you take that out, you're still growing 11% in Government. And I was always kind of under the impression that with the sale cycles you have in this business, you have just very good visibility. Is this a business now that given either your R&D investments or otherwise, outside of an -- even taking into account, let's say, the macro concerns, you might be able to grow double digits long term? Or is it still kind of mid-single digit growth most of the industry folks have called for? Has anything changed? Or I'm thinking not just about the next quarter, 2 or 3 years out, whether the revenue opportunity for you guys is changing. And then on the question just on the buyback, given the stocks roughly where you bought back almost $3 billion worth of it, is there any reason why you won't continue to be this aggressive? Or is there something on the acquisitions front beyond Psion that you\u2019re maybe thinking about?","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes. On the Government growth, as we said, for the remainder -- for the full year, we're now expecting Government on an annualized basis in 2012 to be high single digits. Kulbinder, I wouldn't forecast anything beyond that. I'd like to see things develop, and we would watch the developments as a team between now and the remainder of the year and then update you on 2013 at that point in time. And in terms of buybacks, Ed said it well. Obviously, we were aggressive buying back $2.9 billion in the last 12 months. That reflected 2 things, the value of which we thought we would -- that's there in buying back the shares and the sub-optimal excess cash on our balance sheet, which required that sense of urgency. We're pleased that the board's authorized the additional $2 billion. We'll be opportunistic. And that will be a key tool in helping us move towards net debt. We wouldn't get into specific levels of buying at what levels or price points beyond that, but we feel well positioned for us to move forward.","Operator","Our final question comes from the site of Matthew Hoffman with Cowen and Company.","Matthew Hoffman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You called out weakness in Europe, and iDEN is affecting results. But I was hoping you could add color around 2 things. First, can you comment on the overall pace of the wireless LAN spending, especially your expectation for the second half spending on the category? And second, can you comment on whether you're seeing IT managers shifting resources away from the Plymouth [ph] wireless LAN over concrete floors and now really focusing more on the BYOD and the carpeted spaces within the Enterprise, too?","Gregory Q. Brown","So Mark and I will tag-team this. I don't think we see a big shift to BYOD per se. We do see continued demand for WLAN. Q2 was down in WLAN for us due to a substantially higher Q2 comp a year ago. We do very well in the targeted verticals, particularly retail and transportation and logistics, where we're aligned with great channel reach. But overall, I think that share\u2019s modestly down in WLAN. I don't think that we've seen any chilling of demand. We still expect for the full year for it to have solid full year growth and be generally in line with what we expected. So I don't think anything beyond that.","Matthew Hoffman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","But kind of drilling down on that, I think there's a wider expectation, Gartner and some other forecasters, to see kind of double-digit wireless LAN growth overall. Maybe this category\u2019s pulling back right now a little bit below the overall wireless LAN growth but prospects gain from here?","Gregory Q. Brown","We actually have a pretty good funnel of engagement around WLAN or managed WLAN networks, a lot in retail and in the Enterprise segments. We still think it will grow double digit, but I don't know if it will grow as robustly as it did last year. I think the whole industry was north of 30% or 35%, so it's TBD on that.","Operator","I will turn the floor over back to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks.","Shep Dunlap","Thank you.

Brown","Thanks, Shep, and good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Q4 marked another great quarter for Motorola Solutions as we achieved a record performance for sales, operating earnings and operating margin. These quarterly results helped cap a very strong and exciting year for our company. 2011 was a year in which we streamlined and strengthened our portfolio, generated excellent cash flow, delivered substantial operating earnings expansion and returned significant capital to our shareholders. Highlights for the quarter included growth in all regions. Strong Government growth, improved operating leverage and the continuation of a meaningful capital distribution program for our shareholders.","This morning, we reported sales in the fourth quarter of $2.3 billion, an increase of 5% from Q4 of last year. On a GAAP basis, net earnings were $0.54 per share from continuing operations compared to $0.49 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations were $0.87 per share compared to $0.64 per share in Q4 of last year, a 36% increase. For the full year, we posted revenue growth of approximately 8% while increasing non-GAAP operating earnings by 29%. For the remainder of this call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise noted. ","So overall, our Government business revenues increased 6%. North America, Asia and Latin America all saw steady growth, while EMEA was down slightly due to continued challenges in Western Europe, but also the modules business divestiture we had earlier. Operating earnings in the Government business grew 39% due to the strength in sales, a stronger product portfolio and continued expense management. Government sales increased 6% for the full year exceeding our outlook of low single digits.","In our Enterprise business, sales increased 3% from the year-ago quarter, including an anticipated decline in iDEN. Growth in Enterprise, excluding iDEN, was 9% for the quarter. Growth was driven by enterprise mobile computing and wireless LAN, including managed services as customers continue to view us as a strategic partner, enabling them to increase efficiencies, revenues and customer satisfaction. Operating earnings in the Enterprise business grew 10%. On a full year basis, the Enterprise business delivered revenue growth of 11%.","The sales growth this past year in both businesses is a result of our continued focus on new product innovation and delivering solutions recognized by Enterprise and Government customers as an investment with high returns. We continue to enhance the features available on our products, and we've expanded or tiered many of our product portfolios including mission critical voice and enterprise mobile computing.","With respect to capital allocation, I'm pleased with our continued progress. During the quarter, we paid $72 million in dividends and repurchased $366 million in MSI stock, bringing the total repurchase amount to over $1.1 billion during the first 2 quarters of the program that we announced last July.","I'll now turn the call over to Ed to discuss our financial results in more detail, then I'll return to discuss some operational highlights and provide additional thoughts on our business performance.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Thanks, Greg, and good morning. As Greg mentioned, our Q4 sales included growth across all our regions and much of our product portfolio. Along with solid revenues, our disciplined expense management yielded another excellent quarter of operating leverage. On a full year basis, revenue grew 8% to $8.2 billion while operating earnings as a percent of revenue was 16.7%. This represents a 29% increase in operating earnings from 2010.","In our Government business, we saw continued growth in the fourth quarter with sales of $1.5 billion, an increase of 6% from the prior year. 2011 full year Government revenues were $5.4 billion, growing 6% over 2010. The Enterprise business grew 3% to $753 million in Q4 driven by enterprise mobile computing, wireless LAN and related managed services. These Enterprise results included a $37 million decline in iDEN revenues. For 2011, the Enterprise business posted revenues of $2.8 billion, growing 11% year-over-year. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.87 per share compared to $0.64 per share a year ago, a 36% increase.","Operating expenses were $725 million or 31.5% of revenue, which represents a 300-basis-point improvement from the year-ago quarter. Operating expense dollars were up slightly on a sequential basis and generally in line with our expectations, which we shared with you on the Q3 call.","Our operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $444 million or 19.3% of sales compared to $346 million or 15.8% in Q4 2010. Operating earnings growth was over 5x the top line growth in the quarter. Similar to Q3, this accelerated increase in earnings growth was driven by continued expense management focus, as we lowered both R&D and SG&A as a percentage of revenue.","Total other income and expense was a net expense of $9 million in the quarter compared to a net expense of $24 million in Q4 2010. This quarter's results benefited from lower interest expense due to a decline in outstanding debt. In future quarters, we expect this line item to be a net expense of approximately $15 million to $20 million.","Our effective tax rate was 33.7% for the quarter. For 2012, we'd expect our tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 35%. The average cash tax rate still expected to be approximately 20% or approximately 6 years as we utilize available tax credits.","Cash flow from operations was $44 million this quarter, which was impacted by an incremental $250 million cash contribution to our U.S. pension plan, which I'll cover in a moment. For the full year, we generated operating cash flow of $847 million, including a total of $480 million of contributions to the U.S. pension plan. We ended the quarter with $5.1 billion in cash and investments and $1.5 billion in debt, which reflects the $600 million debt payment in the quarter. We also spent in excess of $438 million in cash this quarter for share repurchase activity and dividends. As Greg mentioned earlier, we repurchased $366 million in stock during the quarter which brings us to over $1.1 billion in share repurchases for the first 2 quarters of the plan. This amounts to a total of 26.6 million shares at an average price of $41.77. In addition, we paid $72 million in dividends during the quarter. ","Before I turn to our outlook, let me spend a moment summarizing some of the important items surrounding our U.S. pension plan including our liability, cash contributions and expenses going into this year. As you all know, our pension deficit is impacted by the volatility of corporate bond rates, which are used to determine the plan discount rate as well as return on the pension plan asset portfolio. The discount rate used to measure liability at the end of 2011 came in at 5.1% compared to 5.75% in the prior year. Due to the new discount rate, our total underfunded U.S. pension plan at year end increased to $2.2 billion. Our planned contributions of $230 million and the incremental $250 million contributed in Q4 helped to partially mitigate the impact of the lower discount rate on our net obligation and future pension costs. Based on the company's current position, we are projecting an increase of approximately $60 million in operating expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 related to pension costs.","In terms of the funding for this upcoming year, we plan to contribute approximately $340 million to the U.S. pension plan. As a reminder, the U.S. pension plan was frozen in 2009 and has no future service cost.","Now turning to our Q1 and full year outlook. For Q1, we expect sales growth of approximately 4% over the first quarter of 2011, including an estimated $35 million year-over-year decline in iDEN revenues. We expect Q1 operating earnings of 14% to 14.5% compared to 14.5% in the first quarter last year. Our outlook is for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.55 from continuing operations utilizing the Q4 ending share count. This compares to non-GAAP EPS in Q1 2011 of approximately $0.55 per share.","As we discussed in our Q1 call last year, the $0.55 per share in Q1 2011 benefited from several nonoperating items within other income and expense primarily relating to investment and foreign currency gains. And an impact of those items on a year-over-year basis is approximately $0.08 per share. This outlook excludes items historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings releases and stock-based compensation and intangible amortization expenses of approximately $0.11 per share. Intangible amortization declines from $50 million to $7 million approximately per quarter as certain intangible assets associated with the Symbol acquisition became fully amortized in 2011. ","Moving to full year 2012. Our outlook is for sales growth of approximately 5%, which includes an anticipated $70 million iDEN decline. We expect full year operating earnings to be approximately 17%. The first quarter and full year outlooks factor in the previously mentioned $60 million in additional pension expense we will incur during 2012.","Finally, we expect to grow operating cash flow in line with improvements in net income for 2012. As Shep mentioned at the beginning of this call, the outlook I shared with you is based on recently updated financial results, which reflect the exit of the Amateur, Marine and Airband radio business.","I'll now turn the call back to Greg for business highlights for the quarter.","Gregory Q. Brown","Thanks, Ed. In Government, our sales for the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 6% over Q4 2010. Profitability for the business also improved with operating earnings of 19.8% of sales this quarter compared to 15.2% in Q4 of last year. Our growth in the Government business of 6% for the quarter and 6% for the full year demonstrates that mission critical communications remain a priority for our public safety customers and the communities they serve. We had a strong finish to a very good year in North America Government with full year sales growth of almost 6% in the region. Consistent with historical trends, growth in Asia and Latin America was also very good. EMEA saw a modest decline for the quarter and the year driven primarily by the divestiture of the Modules business. There are many common demand drivers across all geographies as public safety users seek improved capability and coverage enhanced features from digital and interoperability.","In ASTRO, our market-leading P25 compliant radio system, we won several new large awards including St. Louis County for $65 million to design and build one of the largest local radio systems in the Midwest; and Washington State Patrol for $25 million, which will integrate with the existing Department of Justice P25 trunked system in the state. The state of Tennessee chose us to implement Phase 1 of a statewide radio system to replace a decades-old system. The $29 million upgrade will improve communications across public safety agencies and includes new safety enhancements such as emergency man-down notification and GPS capabilities along with improved coverage and multi-agency interoperability.","We also won ASTRO awards with several counties in Florida, including St. Johns for $26 million, Seminole for $15 million, Osceola for $11 million. In Latin America, we won a $20 million contract with the National Police of Ecuador to expand their P25 system and an ASTRO system with the Mexico Federal Electric Commission. We won a 5-year, $22 million contract to build a digital radio network for Western Australia's emergency services, upgrading the existing Police Metropolitan Radio Network. The project, when complete, will mark the first time 3 public safety agencies in Western Australia will share the same network. We expanded our ASTRO APX line up of radios to include an APX 4000 portable radio for public works, utilities and rural public safety. APX now represents the first complete portfolio of P25 Phase 2 TDMA two-way portable radios in the industry.","Our portfolio extends beyond voice communications into other areas core to public safety, such as dispatching in the operations center. This past quarter, we were selected by the city of Atlanta to integrate their surveillance camera systems, which will enable Atlanta Police Department to observe incidents real time and deploy law enforcement personnel more efficiently. Douglas County, Nebraska recently chose our PremierOne computer-aided dispatch application to serve their needs in adjoining counties. The Douglas County project represents the first installation of our PremierOne software into a customer-managed virtualized environment and will result in more efficient use of the county's mission critical IT hardware resources.","We continue to invest in our next-generation public safety LTE solutions and achieved another milestone this quarter with the first commercial shipment of our public safety LTE devices. We also were awarded a $4 million LTE contract with Irving, Texas as part of a larger voice communications system. Our LTE solution gives public safety agencies the ability to immediately prioritize users, most critical to serving an incident and allocate network resources when disaster strikes.  In addition, our solution is interoperable with public carrier LTE networks, providing a way for public safety agencies to extend their coverage through roaming agreements.","Growth in our professional and commercial radio portfolio continued this quarter driven by customers replacing analog systems with digital using our MOTOTRBO platform. This trend drove solid double-digit sales growth for the portfolio and was evident in mature markets as well as growth markets. For example in Q4, we won major deals in Russia, Afghanistan and in Nigeria, where we sold 25,000 MOTOTRBO radios to the Ministry of the Interior in the biggest MOTOTRBO project to date in the EMEA region.","Moving on to our Enterprise business, sales in the Enterprise was $753 million, an increase of 3% from Q4 of 2010. This included a $37 million decline in the iDEN business and solid demand for the rest of the Enterprise portfolio. Operating earnings expanded to 18.2% of sales from 17.1% last year. For the full year, 11% growth in Enterprise was driven by demand for our enterprise mobile computing, advanced data capture and WLAN infrastructure products. Each of these product portfolios grew at double-digit rates. Demand remains strong in our largest enterprise vertical of retail. The traditional retail landscape is rapidly incorporating new technologies around mobility that influence consumer buying behavior.","Our solutions in enterprise mobile computing devices and WLAN infrastructure help retailers meet consumer expectations for service and convenience, from stocking to customer service and checkout. Shoppers Drug Mart, a leading Canadian provider of pharmacy products and services, is installing our micro kiosks for price checking in most of their 1,200 locations. And retail customers continue to invest in our compelling RFID solutions like Lord & Taylor, who's deploying handheld RFID readers in their stores to maintain accurate inventory levels and prevent out-of-stock situations, thereby improving customer service and sales.","In transportation and logistics, we saw a continued momentum during the quarter including projects with Italian post and a Dutch company specialized in logistics services. In addition, UPS recently awarded us a new contract for WLAN products that provide advanced WiFi for mobile computing. This WLAN infrastructure will support UPS's next generation package scanning solution at its sorting facilities, utilizing our wireless terminals and imagers.","Growth in Enterprise was in part driven by this category, expanding devices like the ES400, which appeals to a customer base that requires a ruggedized device in a smaller form factor. The ES400 has proven to be a beneficial portfolio addition, particularly in EMEA where it's seen adoption by field mobility workers who make use of productivity and location applications running on the device.","Another win with Iron Mountain demonstrates continued moment with enterprise mobile computing for field mobility. Iron Mountain is currently deploying MC9590 dual WAN enabled mobile computing devices with a proof of delivery application providing accurate tracking and real-time status updates.","This quarter, we introduced the MC2100 industrial series, addressing the need for a smaller rugged enterprise mobile computer that expands the range of solutions available for large enterprises and small and medium businesses.","The lightweight and ergonomic MC2100 is ideal for inventory management, stock replenishment, price marking and labeling. It is also the first value-tier rugged handheld in the industry to support HTML5 via the RhoElements application framework that we announced last quarter.","Turning now to a regional view for the company. For the quarter, North America sales grew 6% while EMEA grew 4% driven by continued strength in Enterprise, growth in Asia was 7% and Latin America grew 2% due to the planned decline in iDEN. For the full year, our regional sales performance included healthy growth in every region including North America, 5%; EMEA, 9%; Asia Pac, 14%; and Latin America, 10%. We also continue to scale our global services team and build advanced services offerings around our core Enterprise and Government portfolio. An example of the depth of the team is that we signed recently a new $134 million agreement with the state of Victoria in Australia to support the Metropolitan Mobile Radio ASTRO system, a contract that began in 2004 to design, build and manage the network for emergency services organizations. And recently, we reached an agreement to take over the Norwegian nationwide TETRA network from Nokia Siemens Networks. Upon closing of this transaction, we'll broaden our scope from a sub-supplier of core TETRA radio infrastructure to become the prime contractor, including all managed services for the rollout and implementation of the mission-critical systems serving emergency and public safety services in Norway.","Every day, our solutions are helping people be their best in the moments that matter. This past year, there were numerous examples where customers and communities experienced natural disasters and emergency incidents. Our communication systems are relied upon during these difficult moments and our long-term commitment to this marketplace is exemplified as we help with rebuilding and recovery efforts. ","In closing, our Q4 results were a terrific finish to an outstanding year. We exceeded our financial performance goals in 2011 while executing on our capital allocation plans, which included a $1.2 billion of capital returned in the form of share repurchase and dividends.","I'd also like to thank our people and partners for their outstanding accomplishments throughout the entire year. They continue to respond to the needs of our customers and partners in each business and region where we do business. Given our leadership position and market-leading innovation, I look forward to continued growth as we provide best-in-class solutions to both our Government and Enterprise customers.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, we want to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up so we can accommodate as many people as possible. Operator, please instruct our callers on how to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Peter Misek with Jefferies & Company.","Peter Misek - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess, if we look at 2 key factors, if we look at 2013, I know it's next year and we look at public safety legislation, if it were to pass this year given Congressional support, never mind the bickering they have, how many quarters do you think it'll be before we would see a ramp in revenue for that if we make assumption that it passes this year?","Gregory Q. Brown","Peter, if you're referring to kind of D Block, it's a close call. It's tough to say whether it will go this year or not. But what I would say is that we are -- we remain pretty confident that eventually additional spectrum will be made to public safety. To remind you, and I think you referenced it, we're not anticipating any material revenue contribution in '12 from LTE. But I think eventually they'll get there and they'll coalesce around a plan to give public safety more spectrum. That as we've referred to, LTE is incremental to the plan and included and incorporated in the guidance we've given for this year.","Peter Misek - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And just to sneak one in on the guidance for next quarter, if we look at historical patterns and what seems to be like your backlog going into the quarter, it looks like the growth that you're forecasting seems very conservative. Can you give us a little bit more detail there in terms of puts and takes, seasonality on how we should be thinking about Q1?","Gregory Q. Brown","Well, and I'm glad you mentioned that, Peter, because to remind everybody, from a linearity standpoint, Q1 is typically our lowest quarter. So our guidance incorporates looking at historical trends for revenue contribution. So it's 4% including the decline of iDEN in Q1, which I think is $37 million in Q1. So if you normalize for that, we would anticipate on a normalized basis, it being higher. But you're right, Q1 is technically the lowest revenue growth quarter and then we ramp over time. For the full year, we're expecting 5% all-in even with a $70 million decline in iDEN. And we're forecasting and anticipating operating margins of about approximately 17%.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When we think about your outlook for 2012, I want to make a couple of clarification questions, then I have a follow-up. I assume that 5% outlook in sales is excluding the exiting of businesses, is that correct?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","That's correct. The results that have been included in discontinued operations will be taken out and that guidance is provided with that in context.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my question is when we think about, your company has a lot of attractive cash flow and this year you paid down debt, you started issuing stock buybacks and dividends and such. When we think about your cash flow, which, if I heard correctly, you think should basically mirror your sales growth of 5%, maybe I'm off on that. But let's say your cash flow does grow by 5% next year, how should we think about the cash deployment there? Are you looking at a continual reducing of your share base? Does acquisition start to be a little bit more interesting here? How should we think about that use of cash, which is a good issue to have?","Gregory Q. Brown","Okay, thanks, Jim. I think a couple of things. First, we have the $2 billion share repurchase program as we talked about, $1.1 billion through that program through the end of the year. Another $900 million left to go through the end of 2012. I think on the -- when you look at the cash flow generation, the operating cash flow, I think we're still sticking to the guidelines that we gave at the end of the second quarter. That framework of the allocation of cash that is generated, 25% CapEx, approximately 30% to dividends and then that 45% remainder to a flexible combination of acquisitions and\/or incremental share repurchases. So I think we're sticking with that, and I think that framework will work for us going forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Stanley Kovler - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is actually Stan Kovler for Ehud. I was wondering if you can update us on the $1.5 billion LTE funnel that you used to talk about before. Where does that still stand, if you can give us some information there?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","So Ehud, if you think about -- I'm sorry, Stan, if you think about what we've talked about in the past, we still remain very confident about the LTE funnel. And we talked about in the past that it was not only a North American funnel, it's been driven somewhat by the BTOP grant and the D Block that Greg mentioned earlier. But there's also strong demand in the Middle East and in parts of Asia, as well as Latin America where we're doing a trial in Brazil and are talking to Colombia as well. So that funnel is still very healthy. As we've talked about earlier, no meaningful revenue in 2012, but we do expect the ramp to start in '13 and continue forward in the out years beyond that. So we're still very excited about the LTE business as we go forward.","Operator","So next, the side of Craig Hettenbach with Goldman Sachs.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Greg, can you touch on the backlog in the public safety business and also visibility in that business today versus recent quarters?","Gregory Q. Brown","So Craig, I would say our visibility is pretty consistent with previous quarters. So we've talked about having a reasonable view, 3 to 6 months out. I think that's the same as we -- as it has been historically. Backlog was down slightly exiting the year as we finished 2011, but we feel good about our position and it's been incorporated in the guidance we've given.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, Ed, on the 17% operating margin target, you talked about some of the pension expense. Any other puts and takes as you think about margins as you trend through the year in terms of SG&A and gross margin?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","I think the big one we talked about is the pension expense of $60 million, but we also did talk about the iDEN decline to a certain extent, right? So the $70 million decline in iDEN, which we have talked a bit more profitable given the stage of that business and the position that we are there in that business. So I think, those are that 2 big factors. We'll get that leverage at the top line by managing expenses, but growing the operating earnings from 16.7% to approximately 17% as a result.","Operator","We'll go next to Tavis McCourt with Morgan Keegan.","Tavis C. McCourt - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","The question is really on 2012 guidance, although Enterprise, ex-iDEN, is still growing, it clearly decelerated throughout this year. And I was wondering as we look at the 5% guidance for the full year, how should we be thinking about that split between Government and Enterprise and even if you can just talk qualitatively about that. And then a follow-up on the pension, Ed. The cash contributions you're putting into the pension both last year and this year, are those minimum requirements? And if not, what are the costs and benefits you're weighing to decide on that cash number?","Gregory Q. Brown","So Tavis, as you think about it, we've had really good Enterprise performance for the last several quarters and very pleased with it. Going into 2012, as we look at our individual businesses and segments with Government and Enterprise, we think about Government growing low to mid-single digits for 2012 and Enterprise growing for high single digits, and that's the mix that we're anticipating that gets incorporated for the full year annualized at 5%. I think that this push for mobility in the Enterprise, specifically in retail and the press for having store operations is informed as smart consumers when they come in. Because more and more shoppers are smarter, is pushing retailers and other enterprise verticals to equip and modernize from a mobility technology standpoint, and those trends serve us well.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","So on the pension front, as you mentioned, the $230 million was more in line with what we had planned at the beginning of the year and in line with what would be required. The $250 million was the incremental amount that was contributed this year, the voluntary amount if you will, bringing the total contributions for the U.S. plan to $480 million. The $340 million next year, I would view more in line with the required amounts as we look at the pension contributions for the full year 2012.","Operator","Our next question from Jeff Kvaal with Barclays Capital.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to get into the Enterprise segment a little bit because actually I'm not sure that it was as strong as you would have hoped it would be. A little bit below seasonality in the fourth quarter, and it seems a little bit light in the first. Now it sounds as though that iDEN is a big part of that. And if that's the case, would you mind giving us a little bit more detail on how big iDEN is as a percentage of the mix? And if there's more to it rather than iDEN, we'd -- I'd obviously love to hear that.","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes, Jeff. So iDEN was -- declined $37 million in Q4. And as you -- which is obviously included in our Enterprise results and compressed the revenue growth to all-in of 3% for Q4. If you think of 2012, iDEN is going down approximately $70 million, of which half of that decline is hitting us -- anticipated to hit us in Q1. So that's the math that's working its way through the Enterprise P&L. But normalized for that, we continue to see some positive demand both in transportation and logistics. And obviously, for Q4, we grew 9% and for the full year, 11%. So -- and it's coming off a pretty high base year of comps, too. So that's the composition of the segment.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Could you tell us what the total iDEN revenues were for 2011?","Gregory Q. Brown","So in '11, they were $365 million I believe. And I think they're going to be -- we're planning on approximately $300 million for 2012.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And would it be fair to say that they are above the corporate -- above the segment average operating margin?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","That's correct.","Operator","We'll go next to the side of Larry Harris with CL King.","Lawrence M. Harris - CL King & Associates, Inc.","Was wondering if you could perhaps discuss, and I know it's a relatively small business, but the Amateur, marine, Air\/land radio business, was that contributing about $22 million in revenues per quarter? And was this in the Enterprise or Government segment? And why is it being discontinued? It didn't look like it had a major impact one way or another on earnings.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Yes, Larry. I think your comment is exactly right across both fronts, it was roughly $90 million for the full year. We had picked up those businesses when we made the acquisition of Vertex Standard. It was really noncore to our business as you mentioned. Wasn't really substantial, so we've decided to exit that Marine, Airband and the Amateur business and stick back to our core business. It was reported in the Government segment. So we're going back to our core Government business. Those brands will continue on under a new brand of Yaesu as it goes forward. So we won't be in those lines of business.","Lawrence M. Harris - CL King & Associates, Inc.","And do you expect much in the way of proceeds from this or what will happen?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","No, it was...","Gregory Q. Brown","I would just say it was just a part of an agreement that we made with the former owner, and there was a division of assets, if you will, so not a lot of net proceeds as a result.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Deepak Sitaraman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Greg, just a question for you. In the core Enterprise business ex-iDEN, your guidance for the full year seems to suggest a meaningful deceleration. Is that more reflective of just the cyclical nature of that business or are there certain geographies or verticals that are driving that view?","Gregory Q. Brown","I think, Deepak, it's more or less coming off of previous periods, strong growth in terms of year-on-year comp candidly. We expect -- we had record years in our advanced data capture business, in our WLAN business, enterprise mobile computing was really robust. We expect a continuity in extension of strong performance in those product areas. And so I think it's more or less that. Now obviously, as I mentioned, we still are all-in planning on high single digits for the Enterprise for revenue and low to mid on the Government segment.","Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Excluding the iDEN decline, right? So that's...","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","The other comment around the regional clarity, we spoke in the last couple of calls about the strength of Enterprise in Europe and particularly Western Europe, which again as we plan for this year, we've been a little more conservative given everything that's going on in that region.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a question on the short-cycle Enterprise business. Are you seeing any kind of destocking or any kind of major movement in those businesses?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","I think as we look at that business, we see the trends continuing the same. In fact, as we work through all of the supply chain issues that arose last year due to the incidents in Japan and in Thailand, our distributors have continued to show strength. In fact, they continue to stock at pretty good levels. So interestingly enough, across the board, the demand, the buying patterns, as well as the trends seem to remain consistent to what we've been seeing in the past.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","RFID, you've talked about that a few times, Greg. Can you kind of give us an idea of the size of that market as you see it now? And with the standards getting a bit more kind of settled out, where do you see that as a growth opportunity for your business and how do you see yourself positioned? Are you primarily a reader's player? Have you done anything -- you used to have a packaging capability, do you still have that? Can you give us a little bit of a more run down on that part of your business?","Gregory Q. Brown","So Brian, we're -- I'm still very excited about the opportunity but candidly, it's pretty small. And I think it will remain small. Now we've had some great client references. I mentioned Lord & Taylor is the most recent. And yes, we're active, and I think lead in the mobile reader space. I think more and more retailers and other enterprise clients will also look to incorporate fixed. I think there's opportunities for RFID, both mobile and fixed, and perhaps optimize with some things in our WLAN portfolio that could be unique. So I consider us very strong in RFID. I like our patent portfolio. I like our product portfolio, but it is small. And while it remains an interest of high appeal for many customers, it's not -- by no means material, and I wouldn't see it as such for the foreseeable future.","Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So it's below 5% of revenues?","Gregory Q. Brown","Absolutely, yes, for sure.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt Thorton with Avian Securities.","Matthew Thornton - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division","Ed, a quick question. Can you remind us, I know you guys have a debt payment coming up this year, I think it's like $400 million. What quarter does that hit? And then secondly on the payment to Motorola Mobility, how much is left and kind of how will that play out?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","So on a debt piece, it's the fourth quarter and it's a $400 million amount that comes due. We remain flexible on what we plan to do with that. And we'll give you more updates on that as we move forward on the quarters. On the Motorola Mobility, I believe the amount that's left to...","Unknown Executive","$75 million.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","To go there is $75 million. That will depend upon as we disclosed repatriation of cash from certain foreign jurisdictions. So we'll update you on that as there's news to report.","Matthew Thornton - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got you. And how much did you guys repatriate in the quarter?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","We repatriated in excess of $400 million during the quarter.","Matthew Thornton - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, terrific. And just one follow-up if I could, quickly. On the Wi-LAN business, I know it's a fairly small but a high-growth business for you guys. Can you kind of just talk about the demand you're seeing there quarter-to-quarter? And then perhaps just talk about how much of a priority you're putting on, pushing outside of retail and your core cement 4 verticals into other verticals in that market?","Gregory Q. Brown","So the WLAN business and market overall is -- as you know, Matt, is really strong growth, and we were clearly a beneficiary of that, which was reflected by the fact that we've had our best year ever. Now we do focus and we have great success in the verticals where we're strong. So retail, transportation and logistics, energy, utilities and that remains the power alley of where we focus our WLAN portfolio. We're not nearly as successful in the verticals where we are not as strong from a distribution and sales coverage standpoint. But the other thing I'd mention, Matt, is it's becoming an interesting asset, more interesting asset as a component in our services strategy. So as enterprise customers want to manage mobility behind the firewall, and they're trying to do device management and security and manageability for a portfolio devices and optimize the performance of those devices with WiFi infrastructure, obviously we bring all 3 elements of that stool, the devices, the wireless LAN portfolio, as well as the manageability software. So it was -- it had a really good year, and I think we've got a great team leading it. And I expect it to grow pretty strongly again in 2012. And we will be targeted in our stronger verticals and using it as an anchor tenant in some of our managed services offerings.","Operator","I show we have no further questions at this time.

Mr. Dunlap, you may begin your conference","Shep Dunlap","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss third quarter results. With me this morning are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Corporate Vice President and Acting CFO; and Mark Moon, Executive Vice President and President, Sales and Product Operations. Greg and Gino will review our results along with commentary, and Mark will join for the Q&A portion of the call.","Earlier this morning, we posted an earnings presentation and press release at motorolasolutions.com\/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. It is important to review these materials.","A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation. Forward-looking statements are any statements that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of Motorola Solutions, and we can give no assurance that any future results or events discussed in these statements will be achieved.

Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements contained in this presentation.","And with that, I would like to now turn the call over to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown","Thanks, Shep. And good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Today, we reported third quarter sales of $2.1 billion, a decrease of 2% from last year. Sales in Government declined 4% while Enterprise sales increased 2%. On a GAAP basis, net earnings from continuing operations were $1.16 per share compared to $0.72 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations were $1.32 compared to $0.84 per share in Q3 of last year. For the remainder of this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise noted.","As I share our results for the quarter, I think there are 3 key themes I'd like to emphasize. First, we drove improved operating margins in both businesses as a result of solid gross margins and lower operating expenses, and we remain on track to deliver on our 18% operating margin target for the full year. Second, the Government business remains very solid, coming off last year's record levels, with strength in Europe, strength in U.S. state and local, and that is despite weaker-than-expected U.S. federal sales. This business is very well positioned for growth in Q4, with record backlog. Third, our Enterprise business is showing signs of improvement, despite a muted spending environment in our key markets and verticals.","I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on our Q3 results, and then I'll return to further discuss the quarter.","Gino A. Bonanotte","Thanks, Greg. In Q3, we continued our focus on driving margin improvement and operational discipline. Although we saw an expected top line decline in the quarter, we remain encouraged regarding our position in both businesses. In terms of the quarter, Q3 total company sales declined 2%.","Third quarter Government sales were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 4% from the prior year quarter. In the Europe and Africa region, we saw double-digit growth, driven by large project rollouts and our expanded device portfolio in TETRA. In North America, results were mixed. We experienced strong strength in state and local government, offset by weakness in our federal sales. We did not see the typical ramp that corresponds with a federal fiscal year-end. In addition, we saw significantly lower-than-normal U.S. federal orders and RFP activity in September. Turning to margins. We posted operating margins in the Government segment of 20.4%, which were flat with Q3 2012. Improved operating expenses offset the anticipated decline in revenues and corresponding gross margins.","Enterprise revenues increased 2% to $647 million. Excluding the impact of Psion and iDEN, Q3 revenues declined 4% compared to high single- and low double-digit declines over the past 4 quarters. As Greg mentioned, we believe this business is stabilizing, and we are encouraged by continued customer engagement and trials for our expansion products. Operating margins in the Enterprise business improved 290 basis points from 12.2% to 15.1%. Higher sales volume, stable gross margins and lower OpEx contributed to the margin increase.","For the total company, operating expenses were $659 million, which is down $50 million or 170 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Approximately $20 million of this decrease comes from structural cost improvements while the balance is attributable to lower variable or incentive payments this year. While I'm pleased with our efforts to reduce operating costs year-to-date, we continue to actively drive operating leverage, which remains a high priority. Given the actions that we have undertaken this year, we expect Q4 operating expenses of approximately $50 million lower than the prior year quarter. Overall operating earnings for the third quarter were $397 million, 18.8% of sales, compared to $387 million or 18% in Q3 2012. This represents an 80-basis-point improvement as a result of our continued focus on operating expense management.","Other income and expense was a net expense of $18 million in the quarter compared to a net expense of $13 million in Q3 of 2012. This expense was approximately $20 million lower than we expected due to the timing of gains on several investments within our ventures portfolio during the quarter. We continue to expect this line item to be an expense of approximately $40 million per quarter going forward.","Our effective tax rate was 7% for the quarter. The third quarter effective tax rate was favorably impacted by $96 million of net tax benefit associated with excess foreign tax credits on undistributed foreign earnings. This benefit was a result of actions taken earlier this year to implement the foreign holding company structure we announced in May.","Based on our current outlook, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 11% for the full year 2013, approximately 13% for Q4. In 2014, we expect our ongoing effective tax rate to return to 32% to 33%.","Moving to cash flow. Cash generated by operating activities in the third quarter of 2013 was $152 million compared to $182 million in the third quarter of 2012. For the full year, we expect cash flow from operations of approximately $800 million. We ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in total cash and $2.5 billion in debt.","With respect to capital return, we repurchased $425 million or 7.5 million shares at an average price of $56.60 per share. As a reminder, we have approximately $2.1 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. In addition to repurchase activity, we paid $69 million in dividends during the quarter.","Now turning to our outlook. With the ongoing uncertainty around the U.S. federal business, our full year outlook is for sales to be approximately flat to last year. We remain on track for operating margins of approximately 18% for the year and expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.63 to $4.70 per share.","I'll now turn it over to Greg for business highlights from the quarter.","Gregory Q. Brown","Thanks, Gino. In Government, public safety continues to be a priority for our customers, and with over 60% of the public safety networks deployed still using analog technology, the opportunity for steady growth continues as customers migrate to digital. Our mission-critical customers expect technology that is intuitive, easy to deploy, interoperable and future-proof.","Over 20 years ago, we released the ASTRO 25, the world's first narrowband digital public safety radio network. And today, we continue to innovate around the open P25 standard, and this quarter, we will release our latest version of ASTRO 25 digital infrastructure. In fact, in Q4 we have over 100 million in shippable backlog associated with this major release that offers a seamless migration path and improved serviceability and scalability, including future LTE upgrades.","Our Astro business declined single digits compared with last year's double-digit growth, while subscriber revenues remained flat with last year's record levels. We won 2 very large Astro awards in Q3, LA-RICS in California for $280 million and Queensland, Australia for over $200 million. Both of these contracts span 15 years. These key wins were the result of years of planning and execution, and they represent the trust and partnership customers have in us for their mission-critical needs.","We also received another large award for $52 million for Phase 3 of the State of Maryland's mission-critical radio system, and the city of Indianapolis signed a 10-year $29 million service agreement for their ASTRO system. Fulton County, Georgia with a $20 million award is investing in our latest P25 offering to replace their existing Motorola trunked radio system, which has been in service since 1992. And Franklin County in Ohio placed an $8 million order to join the Ohio statewide Motorola ASTRO system for their first responders.","Other notable awards at a local level included the City of Arlington, Texas, for $11 million; the City of Portland, Oregon for $18 million. In Canada, we won several contracts, including a contract together with Bell Mobility to supply the province of Nova Scotia with an ASTRO 25 network, APX subscribers and 10 years of lifecycle services. And the Qu\u00e9bec government selected us for a multimillion-dollar contract that includes APX radios and dispatch consoles. In addition, we won a $17 million contract with the City of Montr\u00e9al, which includes APX radios with installation and 10 years of maintenance. And on the command and control application side of the business, Prince George's County, Maryland awarded us a $9 million contract to implement our PremierOne computer-aided dispatch system.","Our TETRA business grew double digits, driven by subscriber shipments and higher services. We recently migrated the Norwegian public safety network onto our latest TETRA platform. And a new award from the Norwegian fire and health agencies represents a 7,000-unit expansion for users on this system. In Germany, we shipped over 20,000 TETRA handsets to the Ministry of Interior. We also delivered 7 million of TETRA software to a country in the Middle East and received a $22 million order from a large country in North Africa.","We continue to win significant competitive awards in China, demonstrating the competitiveness of our TETRA solution. This quarter, we received orders from Shanxi provincial police for $15 million and Wuxi Metro Police for $2 million. TETRA continues to be the leading technology choice among rail customers as well, globally. And this quarter, we won multimillion-dollar awards with Delhi Metro in India, as well as Dalian Metro and Chengdu Metro in China.","Our professional and commercial radio business declined compared to the year ago quarter, driven primarily by lower sales in North America. However, we believe that we're gaining share in this market with our best-in-class digital portfolio, and we continue to invest for growth. For example, we introduced MOTOTRBO Anywhere, a new complement to our digital PCR portfolio, which demonstrates the power of interoperability between public and private networks. MOTOTRBO Anywhere now enables an installed base of millions of MOTOTRBO radio users to communicate with smartphone users for secure business-critical communications.","We continue to invest in LTE, which represents an important part of our future. Over the last 3 years and since we first teamed with Ericsson in an exclusive LTE partnership, we've been developing features and products for public safety's unique LTE requirements. In the U.S., we continue to work closely with FirstNet to ensure the successful development and implementation of an interoperable public safety broadband network that meets the needs of first responders.","On the device side, we recently added a version of the LEX 700 mission-critical handheld on the Android 4.2 Jelly Bean operating system. LEX 700 is designed to work on Band Class 14 private-public Safety LTE networks, as well as commercial cellular networks and 802.11 WiFi. We also recently collaborated with Verizon to deliver the VML 700 vehicular modem, which is designed to operate on LTE-based public safety broadband networks, including FirstNet and Verizon's commercial network. These devices could be used on public networks and then migrate to private networks as they're built.","Our commitment to innovation was evident at the recent APCO show in Anaheim, California, where we introduced a new solution to protect firefighters using APX radios to monitor air tank information at the command center and a new enhanced data channel for the ASTRO system specifically designed for improved GPS and telemetry. We continue to create a path for our customers to transition from analog systems to digital. For example, we introduced a new migration path for customers still using a legacy version of our analog systems, which is now over 15 years old. These users can now enjoy the benefits of new digital technology using SmartX-enabled systems, made possible with trunking simulcast and repeater functionality. This enables existing radios in the fleet to interoperate with the latest digital radios, such as our APX radio subscriber.","Moving on to the Enterprise. Sales increased 2% in our Enterprise business. When excluding iDEN and excluding Psion, the business declined 4%, which is still an improvement over the last several quarters. Enterprise mobile computing increased low-single digits, and together with Psion actually increased double digits, while our WLAN product business declined. Scale, innovation, customization and domain expertise are key differentiators for us in Enterprise. Integration with legacy applications is also critically important for our customers, many of whom have made millions of dollars in back-office investments.","In areas where customer preference for Android in the Enterprise has emerged, we intend to lead this transition, along with the products and application development tools. For example, we continue to invest in R&D to adapt, enhance, integrate and secure the Android operating system to make it truly enterprise-ready with our recent Mx Extensions, which ship on all of our Android-based devices. Our software teams have added our suite of enterprise-grade security, device management and performance extensions, and we've launched mobile computers running Jelly Bean, the most popular version of Android, supported by our new Mx Extensions in RhoMobile","One of our core Enterprise mobile computing products, the MC67, will soon be available on Android. While an entirely new device, the TC55, will launch on Jelly Bean later this month. The TC55 is a pocket-sized touch computer, which merges the features of a traditional Enterprise class mobile computer with the form factor and functionality of a smartphone.","We're also helping customers and partners transition applications with our fourth-generation of RhoMobile, a development platform that enables applications to run on any operating system. And meanwhile, we will continue to execute on our dual OS strategy and continue our work with Microsoft.","One continued area of strength this year in Enterprise is with Asia Pac, Middle East, where sales grew double digits. We attribute this in part to improved sales coverage within the region, as well as a stronger product portfolio with the addition of the MC2100 and MC45, coupled with our services differentiation. In China, we are growing in Enterprise by double digits while maintaining margins. We were awarded a contract from Blue Dart in India for mobile device management, this solution will enable Blue Dart to accelerate their pace of automation and equip one of the largest field delivery workforces in India with thousands of our MC65 devices.","We signed 2 large multimillion-dollar deals with TNT, a leading global international courier company based in Europe. One deployment is in France and the other one is in Italy, and both are for our MC67 mobile computers to equip the company's field operations. In The Netherlands, we received a multimillion-dollar contract award from Jumbo Supermarkets for our MC17s to improve their customer satisfaction and increase customer loyalty with their self-scanning solution. This complements our recently developed smart badges, which have also been successfully implemented in Jumbo Supermarkets as well.","Interest in our expanded Enterprise portfolio continues, as evidenced by our over 100 trial deployments among new expansion products, like the Android-based MC40 and the MP6000, our first-ever bioptic scanner. In general, conversion on these pilots to large-scale rollouts continues to take more time as customers take longer to evaluate new form factors and operating systems. One of our largest awards to date for the MC40 is from a large retailer in western Europe this quarter, with a $4 million contract for these devices to improve their customer service and replenishment operations. Examples of other customers who've begun to roll out our MC40 include a chain of discount variety stores in Australia and a nationwide crafts retailer in the U.S. deploying MC40 Android devices to deliver a better in-store customer experience.","Moving on to the regional results this quarter for the total company. North America revenues declined 6%, with single-digit declines in both Government and Enterprise. Latin America was down 5%, driven by Enterprise while Government was flat. Europe and Africa was up 13%, with double-digit growth in both Government and Enterprise. Asia Pac, Middle East declined 3%, with continued double-digit growth in Enterprise, along with a single-digit decline in Government.","Total service sales were up single digits over last year Q3. The Queensland award for over $200 million represents another important Managed Services win for us in Australia, and a $16 million upgrade of State of Colorado's Pikes Peak regional network represents one of our largest comprehensive lifecycle management agreements to date.","We continue also to see healthy interest in our Real-time Crime Center solution, which integrates mission-critical voice with real-time streaming video, together with access to arrest records, photos and other multimedia inputs. One example is the creation of a new operation center by the State of Illinois' Attorney's Office and local businesses, which incorporates our Real-time Crime Center applications to assist with fighting both financial and retail crimes. Since launching this services-led offering earlier this year, we have booked $20 million in orders.","Our Mobility Lifecycle Management capabilities were a key differentiator also in a recent agreement with Yodel, a leading parcel delivery company in the U.K. They agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership worth in excess of $10 million for deployment of over 7,000 Enterprise mobile computers, including our MC67 and MC45, as part of a mobile lifecycle solution to support their delivery network.","So let me wrap up with some closing comments. I am encouraged by our Q3 results for several reasons. First, in Government, we have the strongest product portfolio in our history, record backlog, and we expect the Government business to return to growth in Q4. We're making excellent progress on delivering Managed Services solutions and next-generation applications for our customers, and this business is very well positioned going forward.","Second, in Enterprise, we are seeing signs of improvement. We remain #1 in all of our major product categories. Backlog is up, and we will continue to take actions that strengthen our go-to-market focus and overall capabilities, and we're making investments in solutions that best serve our customers and their industry-specific requirements.","Third, our team has moved swiftly and thoughtfully with respect to streamlining our cost structure to match the current demand environment. These actions will position us well in terms of driving operating leverage now and down the road. And while we've made some tough decisions with respect to lowering costs, we remain fully committed to growth and are appropriately balancing the need to reduce expenses with the need to make targeted investments for future growth.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask you first on the recent headcount reductions that were in the press. Was that part of the $50 million cost-reduction plan that you announced last quarter? Or was that incremental? And along those lines, are you still targeting a 19% operating margin for next year?","Gregory Q. Brown","Simona, yes, those actions were part of the $50 million that we described in expected annualized savings for next year. And at this point, yes, we are also targeting a 19% operating margin for next year as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Pierre Ferragu with Sanford C. Bernstein.","Pierre Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","If I look at your Enterprise business, what I understand from your comments is that you're clearly turning the corner in mobile computing. And beyond, like, the structural decline in iDEN, your only area where performance is still a bit disappointing is wireless LAN, and that's also a segment where you're clearly not #1. You have like a very small market share, it's also a segment where the market has gotten much more competitive lately. So I have 2 questions. The first one is I would assume that this is a market that will, at some point, need some consolidation, and so how do you think about that? And my second question would be, if we look at WLAN at the moment, what's happening there? You mentioned, 6 months ago, a change in business, where you were moving towards services. So how do you see the future of this business unit if you keep it as a part of Motorola Solutions? And how do you think about considering alternative strategic directions than keeping it internally going forward?","Gregory Q. Brown","Well, Pierre, thanks for the questions. First of all, we're pleased generally with the performance in the Enterprise business in Q3. I love the fact that the Enterprise business, for the first time in 4 or 5 quarters, returned to growth of 2%. As I mentioned, the Enterprise mobile computing business is up single digits, and with Psion, it's up double digits. Our market share position remains very strong, and we're #1 in those key categories. And we're pleased with the business and as well as the pipeline and the engagement around the discussions for mobile computing. We also are -- I think Girish and his product team have done a really nice job on the new products that just are rolling out this month on Android Jelly Bean. As it relates to WLAN, it was down in the face of market growth. As I've mentioned, I do think we had some reasonable Managed Services deals in the quarter, and I like the pipeline and the funnel at this point in time in terms of where we are with customers. When you look at the verticals that we're particularly strong in, like retail and transportation and logistics, the WLAN business is a leader. You're right, we're still transitioning from product to more of a Managed Services-like offering. And there's more work to do, and we're not where we need to be. So we know what we need to do, and we are absolutely focused to not only growing this business but positioning it for sustainable growth in the long term.","Operator","We'll go next to Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Greg, in Q4 guidance, you specifically said Government should be up year-over-year. How should we think about Enterprise? Should that make it back to something flattish or will it still be a decline in your view?","Gregory Q. Brown","For the quarter, we expect Government to return to growth. And on the Enterprise side, I think it is slightly down for the quarter. That's the composition that we're looking at.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then, Gino, can you give us an update on kind of the free cash flow we should expect for this year? And then maybe the puts and takes as we think about next year's free cash flow, some of the headwinds this year that might go away, that would be helpful. And then, Greg, kind of an update commentary on kind of the Microsoft OS strategy in the Enterprise. Obviously, you guys seem to be bringing out a lot of new Android products. Where do you think your other OS partner is in terms of updating the OS for something a little more touch-centric and these rugged applications?","Gregory Q. Brown","Well, let me take the second one first, Tavis. On Microsoft and our overall software strategy, I'm pleased with Girish and the product team because they're doing a fantastic job on Android, and we're rolling out a number of new products on Android Jelly Bean 4.2. In addition to that, we've also announced Mx or Motorola Extension, which is enterprise-grade services around device management, enterprise application control, power management, multiuser log-ins. So I think we're really well positioned on Android. Of course, we have the RhoMobile solution, which is an HTML5 solution that's agnostic of the operating system. And in terms of Microsoft, our expectation is that they would deliver an updated release of the operating system sometime to us midyear, by which we would then follow on with product availability after that point in time.","Gino A. Bonanotte","And Tavis, on cash flow, we expect operating cash flow of $800 million for the year. Just a couple -- some commentary on cash flow. Certainly, from my first day, there's been a focus, primary focus on cash. We talked about, in the last call, $150 million of risk to the cash flow number. Clearly, going through the components, working capital components, as well as balance sheet components, that risk has materialized. And also reflected in the $800 million is the expectation of approximately flat revenue, weakness around federal, uncertainty around federal driving the approximately flat revenue number, as well as some timing on some large projects. So our expectation is $800 million of operating cash flow for the year.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jim Suva with Citigroup.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have 2 questions. First of all, strategically, if you look at your position globally, I believe it was earlier in the year that you had some international challenges, specifically in Asia. Can you update us in that? And also let us know if the political changes in China has had any impact on your business at all or if it just really didn't? And then the second question is, can you help us understand the importance of keeping the wireless LAN business? And the reason why -- and I don't expect you to dispel every rumor out there or trade blog about your company, but there was some -- several sources picking up that you guys would be potentially considering selling it. And sometimes, if that information is accurate out there, it can actually be detrimental to the business as competitors use that as a doorknocking opportunity.","Gregory Q. Brown","Let me take China and WLAN, and then I'll turn it over to Mark for Asia. In China, Jim, we're pleased with our performance to date. Our overall revenue is up. Government is up, as well as Enterprise is up. And I think the Enterprise business, in particular, has done a very good job growing strongly in the face of increased competition, and yet we're holding our margins. And I think it's a testimonial to the quality of the product portfolio. TETRA, in particular, has done very well, in particular on rail applications, given the best-in-class mission-critical characteristics of TETRA. So China has actually been a bright spot. Now obviously, it will get more competitive going forward. There's efforts to localize certain standards by which we would expect to work very closely with the Chinese government and participate in the rollout and deployment of those standards. So I think China has been, overall, a bright spot for us so far this year. On WLAN, you're right, there's been speculation, and rhetoric, I'm not going to get into that. You know that we -- it's been an area of focus for us for some time. By the way, I think -- I still think in a stare-and-compare, we have one of the best product portfolios in the industry, supplemented by very good intellectual property. And the WLAN business, as I mentioned, is really strong in retail and transportation, logistics and priority verticals that we're pretty strong in. In terms of Asia, I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark F. Moon","So Jim, as you mentioned, we've been talking about our performance in Asia all year. We talked about we were disappointed coming into the year. We made a number of structural changes. We came in with very low backlog, particularly on the Government side, and we talked about a decline in Q1 of 20%, Q2 of 10%. Actually, we had hoped to get back roughly flat in this quarter. We did not accomplish that. We still declined single digits. So improvement over the previous 2 quarters, but still some decline. The point that's important for me, I also talked about, though, while we were improving this business that we would continue to show signs of increased backlog. And in fact, in this quarter, our backlog position in Asia has improved over $200 million. Driven, of course, by Queensland, but also growth beyond the Queensland, Australia award, which I think is very positive. I do think, in Q4, we will get back to growth. And certainly, Asia Pacific and the Middle East is a growth region for us. So we're putting all the things in place to continue to grow backlog, to continue to get the right coverage and the right places for the growth areas, and we're expecting good solid growth as we go into next year. Again, as Greg mentioned, China has been a bright spot across the board. Enterprise throughout Asia has been bright all the way through, continues to show good strong growth. And so we do see momentum building. And in fact, as Greg mentioned, pleased with China because, to date, we've got very good double-digit growth in Enterprise, single-digit growth in Government and really, we'll be high-single-digits to low-double-digit growth for the full year in China.","Operator","We'll go next to Kulbinder Garcha with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A question for Greg, just one on, basically, visibility and growth. It looks like, this year, you're not going to grow both your core businesses organically. I know there's lots of reasons, there difficult comps in Government, you've had some issues in Enterprise, up until now, it looks like. But could you just speak about the visibility into next year that you have? Is this a business that can go back to its long-term growth rate in 2014? What are the puts and takes around it? Especially considering, it looks like the public safety LTE revenue opportunity, if anything, is probably a 2015 issue completely now, or would you agree with that or disagree? Anything you're thinking about visibility and the business being able to go to even a mid-single-digit growth rate at some point?","Gregory Q. Brown","So Kulbinder, kind of when you look at our business in composite, obviously, we're guiding to approximately flat for the full year. If you look at the Enterprise business, as I mentioned, I'm pleased with the fact that it's grown for the first time in several quarters. Psion has been a good acquisition that helps on that front and extend the product portfolio on the Enterprise mobile computing side. Backlog is up. And I'm not going to get into the composition of growth expectations for 2014. That's something that we'll dimensionalize in January. But it is certainly fair to say that we expect the firm, in total, to grow in 2014. I'm really pleased with where we are in Government, coming off of a record level last year, backlog position, margin position, product portfolio position. We do expect the Government business to return to growth in Q4. And to your point on LTE, while it's been elongated in the U.S., we're really well positioned given the infrastructure, device and software that we expect to deploy for interoperable public safety broadband, working very closely with FirstNet. And also internationally, we've mentioned the fact that LTE is not just a domestic opportunity. I think the Middle East, in particular, will be the most likely countries that deploy or begin to deploy in '14. We will have an expectation for some revenue contribution in LTE in 2014. Too early to tell you what that will be. We'll update that in January. But I -- as rugged a year as it's been, I think we're really well positioned in -- because we've made investments in the product portfolio. The business, in total, will return to growth. We've taken the tough decisions to size it appropriately and demonstrate that irrespective of top line growth, we can perform on the operating margin and operating leverage lever. And I think it -- I'm looking forward to a better year in 2014.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andrew Spinola with Wells Fargo.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On that same topic, for 2014, when I think about your 19% operating margin guidance for the year, how do you think about the opportunity on cost cuts still in front of you given that you've -- the actions that you've already taken?","Gregory Q. Brown","Well, I think that we've done a lot of cost reductions to date, and activities have been launched throughout the year to reflect the more muted demand environment. I always believe that we should always look to size the organization appropriately. So I don't think of cost cutting as an event, I think it's in the ongoing DNA to operate more effectively and efficiently and drive increased productivity in the firm, and I think we've demonstrated that. That said, I believe that the easiest path forward and the most likely path to the approximately 19% will be in the top line growth, since a lot of the chopping of wood on the expense side is more in the rearview mirror. That's my view.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then just one follow-up. I think, Greg, in your prepared remarks you made the comment that the Enterprise business was down 4%, including iDEN and Psion. And in the press release, it said that Enterprise was down 5% excluding Psion. So I guess that implies that the iDEN business was actually up year-over-year in Q3. And I was just wondering, were there any sort of maybe onetime payments related to the shutoff of the Sprint network. And then I think you've made comments recently that it will be $75 million next year. So wondering when we should see that step down.","Gregory Q. Brown","So just a couple of things, and you mentioned it. iDEN will be about $185 million this year. We do expect it to be approximately $75 million in 2014. Enterprise grew 2% all-in for Q3. But without-without, without iDEN and without Psion, it's down 4%, negative 4%. That's still, on an apples-to-apples basis, without-without, an improved trajectory over the previous several quarters on the Enterprise side.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So can we talk a little about -- a couple of things. FirstNet, we were at the FirstNet event in Washington a couple of weeks ago. And it was certainly notable, Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia Siemens in terms of their vocalness in wanting to participate in that effort. Can you talk a little bit about your view on FirstNet in terms of timing? How do you see the competitive environment? Do you see it more nationally awarded versus local, which is, I think, your preference?","Gregory Q. Brown","So first of all, we continue to work really closely with FirstNet. In particular, in the last several months, I think we've had very good traction and engagement. Mark Hacker, who runs our global government affairs organization, who happens also to be the General Counsel, has been the lead executive over the last several months as the point of contact with FirstNet, and I think he's done a hell of a good job. I've stayed very closely in touch with Sam Ginn as well. And more tactically, in the short term, we're working closely with FirstNet to see if there's a path forward on BayRICS, which was an early BTOP award winner and where some of the network has been built out, as well as Mississippi, which is also an early BTOP recipient and where over 2\/3 of the network has been complete. So we're looking for ways -- Motorola Solutions and FirstNet, working very closely together to see if we can complete and get positioned, terms and conditions and a set of -- basically, conditions that complete BayRICS and the State of Mississippi. We remain engaged outside the U.S., particularly in the Middle East, on a couple of fronts. I think from a competitive standpoint, Brian, we're as good as positioned as we've ever been. I think it's actually stronger than it was a year ago, given the investments we've made in infrastructure, software and, in my prepared remarks, examples of refreshing the LEX 700 and the VML vehicular modem on Verizon. Ericsson has been a fantastic partner, where we have about 7 or 8 years left in that agreement. We're taking their base station, so not investing in it in the wireless RAN component. We're hardening it and integrating it interoperably in an end-to-end solution for a private-public partnership around LTE. And Verizon has been a very good partner on the commercial side from a carrier standpoint in the U.S. So I think NSN and Alcatel-Lucent will do their thing, and I respect both firms, but I feel very good about where we are.","Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then, briefly, if you look into Q4 on the Enterprise side, how do you see the business x Psion and x iDEN in terms of sequential growth?","Gregory Q. Brown","I think we see it slightly down in Q4 where, commensurately, we see Government returning to growth in about the mid-single-digit range for Q4.","Operator","And we'll go next to Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","A question for you on the Enterprise segment. I noticed as I looked at the press release that there was no significant wins in the U.S. Do I attribute that to the overall market conditions in the U.S.? Or is there still a hesitancy, with some of your large customers waiting on the operating system issue from Windows? And will the U.S. see more of a headwind with that than perhaps other geographies?","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes. I think the Enterprise results reflect what we've talked about with a combination of customers deferring large purchases or chunking up bigger orders into smaller orders. So I think the results are consistent with the environment that we described. And I don't know if you want to add anything, Mark.","Mark F. Moon","Yes. I think, Keith, we've been talking about the delayed large projects. Run rate has been fairly consistent, and that's still proving to be the case. I would also say we talked about some notable wins even in the WLAN business, and some of the major retailers in the U.S. also did not like to be mentioned in releases as well. So there's good activity, good pilot activity that's going on, but, no doubt, particularly in the U.S., more than any other region, large deployments are continuing to be pushed later into this year and on into next year.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","Okay, great. Appreciate it. And changing gears, I think, slightly over to the federal side. You guys noted weakness in the federal side in the quarter. Would you think it was related in part to the upcoming budget issues that happened in October? Or was there something else weighing there and perhaps some of that potential revenue pushed off, the RFPs and such?","Gregory Q. Brown","I think -- and Mark can jump in as well. I think it was related to the budget standoff and the 16-day government shutdown. There was definitely a change in the month of September. We didn't -- we saw significantly lower normal orders and RFP activity in September, and we did not see the typical ramp that corresponds with the federal fiscal year-end close, which was, basically, the end of Q3. So we saw basically $100 million reduction in our second half of the year forecast that's reflected in our approximately flat full year guidance, definitely a change. And the federal business is down pretty sharply from this year compared to last year.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","So did that businesses just not materialize? I mean, or is it deferred, you think?","Gregory Q. Brown","My view is it largely will not materialize, so we'll adjust accordingly. I don't think it's deferred and something that we can close in Q4, Q1. I basically think it's largely gone.","Operator","And we'll go next to Peter Misek with Jefferies.","Peter Misek - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a clarification question, firstly, on working capital. Obviously, on your slide, you gave a range. But if we look at the amount that AP increased and the amount that inventory and AR increased, can you help us understand how we should think of working capital management sort of on a longer-term basis? If I look at your intensity on a bunch of metrics basis, it seems elevated, so I'd love a clarification there. And then, can you give us an update on your net cash position as it relates to guidance you gave us, that you wanted to go to a net debt position in terms of capital redeployment?","Gino A. Bonanotte","All right. Thanks, Peter. Thanks for the question. This is Gino. With respect to working capital, as I mentioned, we've been digging into all the components of working capital. Have instituted many actions, many of which have not borne fruit yet in Q3. But if I were to break them up individually, inventory remains on track. We're pleased with our performance around inventory at around 9 turns. DPO, we clearly saw degradation in Q2. We have implemented several action plans around DPO based on timing of payments and terms for customers that have -- or I'm sorry, vendors that have multiple terms, and we believe that by the end of Q4, inventory and DPO will be similar to year ending 2012. AR, there are a couple of things that are happening in AR. The Q3 AR has been impacted -- it kind of gets back to the discussion we had on POC. There are several billings that occurred in Q3 for payment in Q4 on some large milestone projects in POC that drove a couple of days in the DSO calculation for Q3. But we expect -- in our $800 million, we expect DSO -- and have action plans in place to get the DSO to be approximately flat year-over-year. So working capital -- from a CCC perspective, working capital approximately flat to last year. With respect to net debt position, we continue to be on track to get to a net debt position in 2014.","Peter Misek - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Any change in terms of the absolute level of net debt that you guys are forecasting or targeting?","Gino A. Bonanotte","No.","Operator","And our last question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Two of them here. Just to follow that up on the net cash. Could you talk a little bit about the capital return? Any change or slowdown required in that -- in the buyback heading into next year as you get into the net debt position? And then, secondly, Greg, back to the Government. You did, I think, highlight that Europe was pretty strong in the quarter. Maybe give us a little sense as to why you think that was and how sustainable you think that could be as we look into next year.","Gregory Q. Brown","Tim, thanks. On capital allocation, no change of strategy or view. I think that we clearly believe it's front and center and critical as a key component to drive shareholder return. You've seen the levels of buyback for Q1, Q2, Q3. So far, I think, at this point, they are reasonable reference points for how we think about share repurchase. In terms of Europe, Mark, I don't know your view.","Mark F. Moon","Yes. Europe and actually, Europe and Africa, which is the region but -- has been very strong for us all year. In fact, year-to-date, we're actually double-digit growth in Government, and we're expecting double-digit growth in Q4 in Government as well. So the Government business continues to remain very, very strong. And as the Enterprise business, as we talked about, has returned as well, so we're not seeing the dips like we saw in North America. I think it would be probably unrealistic to think that, that double-digit Government growth would continue on, but with that -- into next year, but we'll give you that further guidance. The important thing to note is that large projects are happening, even in Europe itself, Norway, German MOI, big countries were getting very good growth. And in northern Africa, we've made really, really good traction with a couple of large projects, and we're continuing to invest throughout Africa for future growth. So the European team, I'm very pleased with how they performed, where we're positioned, our backlog position. Even as you talk about strong growth for Q4, we actually have secured the 4 or 5 big projects. They're in backlog to achieve that growth. So making really good headway, not only on recognizing revenue, but continuing to hold backlog relatively stable as we're going through this strong growth period. So I think we continue to see good signs for Europe.","Gregory Q. Brown","Thanks, Tim. So I would just say -- in closing, I want to thank, in particular, all of the associates worldwide of Motorola Solutions. It's been a challenging year in a tough environment, but I think the team has worked closely together and people around the globe have performed well. I think that moving forward, we are very clear and committed to returning the firm to growth. We're committed to improving operating leverage going forward, and we will continue to take steps to drive superior shareholder return. So decent Q3, we're looking for a better 2014. I appreciate everybody dialing in, and we'll talk soon.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks, Greg. I want to remind everyone the details outlining highlighted items.

I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. First, Q1 was an excellent start to what I believe will be another strong year with first quarter records for sales, operating earnings and ending backlog. Revenue grew 13%. Earnings per share grew 16%, and we generated operating cash flow of $251 million.","I'm pleased \u2013 secondly, I'm pleased with our results in Product and Systems Integration and Services and Software. We reported double-digit growth in both segments driven by the Americas and EMEA. At the same time, we did grow backlog year-over-year by almost $800 million. And finally, demand remained strong across our platforms in LMR communications, command center software in video security and analytics. And we continue to invest in our unique mission-critical ecosystem that we're building for long-term growth.","I'll now turn the call over to Gino. He'll provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning for some closing thoughts.","Gino Bonanotte","Thank you, Greg. Q1 revenue of $1.7 billion, up 13% versus last year, including $137 million of revenue from acquisitions and $38 million of currency headwinds. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions, was up 4%. GAAP operating earnings were $229 million, up $58 million. And operating margins were 13.8% of sales compared to 11.6% in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $315 million, up $55 million or 21%. And operating margins were 19% of sales compared to $17.7 million of sales in the year ago quarter, higher sales and gross margin expansion partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions.","GAAP earnings per share was $0.86 compared to $0.69 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.28, up 16% from $1.10 last year. OpEx in Q1 was $466 million, up $50 million due to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $36 million compared to $27 million in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by an increase in net interest expense of $9 million. The Q1 effective tax rate was 20% compared to 19% last year.","Turning to cash flow. Q1 operating cash flow was $251 million, and free cash flow was $185 million. Operating cash flow was higher by $751 million, and free cash flow was higher by $726 million compared to the prior year. The year-ago quarter included a $500 million voluntary pension contribution. Excluding the pension contribution, Q1 operating cash flow was up $251 million on timing of annual incentive payments, improved working capital and higher earnings.","Capital expenditures were $66 million, up $25 million compared to last year primarily related to Airwave and ESN network investments as well as Avigilon. Capital allocation for Q1 included acquisitions of $445 million of cash and equity for VaaS International Holdings and $136 million in cash for Avtec; $145 million of share repurchases at an average price of $118.98, largely offsetting the dilution associated with the VaaS acquisition; $93 million in cash dividends; and $66 million of CapEx.","Moving to segment results. Q1 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.1 billion, up 12% driven by the Americas and EMEA. Revenue growth from acquisitions in the quarter was $75 million. Q1 Products and SI segment operating earnings were $147 million or 14% of sales, up 70 basis points from last year on higher sales and gross margin partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions. Notable Q1 wins in the Products and Systems Integration segment include a statewide P25 radio system for the state of North Dakota, a $25 million P25 win with the New South Wales Telco Authority and an $8 million TETRA order from a utility customer in Chile.","Moving to the Services and Software segment. Q1 Services and Software revenue was $588 million, up $72 million or 14% from last year driven by growth in the Americas and EMEA. Revenue growth from acquisitions in the quarter was $62 million and currency headwinds were $21 million. Services and Software operating income was $168 million or 29% of sales, up 240 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin expansion partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions.","Some notable Q1 highlights in the Services and Software segment include a $17 million managed Services contract with a mining customer in Latin America, a $7 million computer-aided dispatch and records contract for a large government customer in California, a $5 million order for video services renewal with the city of Chicago Office of Emergency Management. Looking at regional results. Americas Q1 revenue was $1.2 billion, up 17% on grow in both segments. EMEA Q1 revenue was $363 million, up 7% and also driven by growth in both segments. And in Asia-Pac, Q1 revenue was $129 million, down 5% or $6 million due to currency headwinds and continued expected declines in China.","Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was $10.4 billion, up $781 million or 8% compared to last year, inclusive of a $222 million unfavorable change in currency rates. Services and Software backlog was up $885 million or 14% compared to last year, driven by EMEA and the Americas. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog was down $25 million due to Airwave revenue recognition.","Products and Systems Integration backlog was down $104 million or 3% compared to last year due to several large system deployments during the past year in the Middle East and Africa. The Americas backlog was up $31 million year-over-year. Sequentially and similar to last year, Products and Systems Integration backlog was down $185 million, on typical North America seasonality.","Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up 4% to 5% with non-GAAP EPS between $1.55 and $1.60. This assumes $35 million of FX headwinds at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 176 million shares and an effective tax rate approximately 24%. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue growth of 6% to 7% with non-GAAP EPS now to be between $7.60 and $7.72. Full year operating cash flow is still expected to be approximately $1.7 billion. The full year outlook assumes approximately $90 million of FX headwinds at current rates, up from approximately $65 million of headwinds in our prior outlook; approximately $250 million of revenue from acquisitions; and effective tax rate of between 24% and 25%; and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 176 million shares.","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg.","Greg Brown","Thanks, Gino, and let me just close briefly with a few thoughts. First, our Q1 performance positions us for another year of growth coming off a record 2018. Second, we continue to invest in our unique mission-critical ecosystem by expanding our LMR, command center software and video security and analytics platforms. And I expect Services and Software to comprise about 1\/3 of our full year 2019 revenue, up from approximately 31% last year.","And finally, for the full year 2019, I continue to expect us to deliver higher gross margins, operating margins, EPS and cash flow. And as these durable cash flows grow, you should expect continued discipline and rigor around capital allocation for long-term shareholder value.","And I'll now turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Kutsor","Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up, so we can accommodate as many participants as possible.","Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Walter Piecyk of BTIG. Please go ahead.","Walter Piecyk","Thanks. Just want to focus on product systems integration. The growth rate, 12%. Correct me if I'm wrong because I may have misremembered this, but wasn't there \u2013 was it in the last quarter or the March quarter of 2018 didn't have some larger than expected revenue? I think it was Q1 and Q2, so is it fairly difficult comp to put that growth rate on? And if so, what does that mean as we kind of head into Q2 and Q3? Is there something you're able to maintain? Or is there also similarly some kind of onetime or just particularly large contracts that end up getting realized in the quarter? Thanks.","Gino Bonanotte","Yes. Walt, this is Gino. You do remember correctly, Q1 last year, it include a large order, a large revenue from a California customer. If you look at Q1 for PS&I and look at it on an organic constancy currency basis, it's approximately 6% in the quarter. Our expectation for the full year has not changed. We talked about constant currency growth for the full year at approximately 4%. And we talked about the year shaping up similarly to last year, and that's what we're seeing so far. So for the first half, probably a little closer to 5%, full year at approximately 4%. Really, what drove Q1 were a couple of orders in the Fed \u2013 in our Fed division. And that's really what drove the overperformance, about a 6% organic constant currency growth rate.","Walter Piecyk","Right. Sorry, I meant the 6% and just 12% obviously has some of the acquisitions. Okay. And then on...","Gino Bonanotte","Well, I'm sorry, just one more thing. It's important to note that Q1 is our smallest quarter in the year when you look at a seasonality perspective. Q1 is the smallest quarter. Q2 and Q3 are comparable, and Q4 is the largest quarter. So that 6% is coming off of a smaller number in Q1.","Walter Piecyk","Got it. I just thought it would have because of the difficult comp, maybe started \u2013 it would have been flip-flopped from what you said and maybe start a little tougher in the first half and then strengthen from there. But I guess we'll see how the year progresses. My follow-up is for Avigilon, obviously, continuing a lot of press in terms of the amount of the focus on Huawei and how their components are in competitors' cameras. Just curious on has that resonated? Has that started to resonate with customers in that segment? Do you see any actual pickup in whether it's interest or actually order flow as a result of customers rejecting some of your competitors because of the components that they have in there from Huawei? Thank you.","Greg Brown","Yes. Walt, I think it has resonated with some of our customers. And as you know, the concern about Huawei and more specifically, Hikvision and Dahua in the video surveillance space, which is in the National Defense Authorization Act. Obviously, it's a concern with the federal government because they're prohibited \u2013 any federal agency is prohibited from procuring vendor equipment by that brand. Specifically from a component standpoint, you're right.","Huawei has a silicon chip that is in also in a number of our competitors. But if you look at the federal government and then critical infrastructure, which has many of the same attributes, yes, I think it is a growing concern. I think the NDAA takes effect in August of this year, but it's clearly favorable in terms of what we're doing with Avigilon. Avigilon grew \u2013 I think it grew well in Q1 ahead of the market. We still expect it to grow at about 15% and with a little bit more traction in fed government, state and local, in the second half.","Walter Piecyk","What are these companies doing on the sales front? Are they pushing back or saying that they're going to rip this componentry out of their products? Or like what's their defense in why a public safety customer would buy their products versus yours?","Greg Brown","Yes. Walt, a lot of what you've seen with the Huawei, the computer and chips aren't really in public safety. A lot of those are enterprise type customers and there's concerns here, but it's not the same and it's not the same regulations and stipulations as to what they buy as you've seen in the National Defense Authorization Act. So it's a little different approach in the enterprise versus government and critical infrastructure space.","Walter Piecyk","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Keith Housum","Good afternoon guys. Gino, just want to talk about gross profits here. Obviously, a nice step up year-over-year. And according to my back of the NOL calculation, it looks like Services and Software were a big driver of that. Just can you talk about the sustainability of that throughout the year as usually the first quarter of the year is your weakest gross margins? Can we expect that to continue ramping up throughout the year?","Gino Bonanotte","Walt, I'm sorry, Keith. The \u2013 our view hasn't changed for the full year. We talked about margins in the Services and Software segment gross margins approaching 50% and operating margins approaching 30% for the full year. That continues to be our expectation. No change to P&SI as well on margin expectations. We expanded \u2013 we expect to expand margins in both segments in 2019.","Keith Housum","Great. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, Greg, perhaps a little bit of color on the strategy of making the Avtec acquisition in the quarter?","Greg Brown","Avtec. Avtec, yes. So the Avtec, we're excited about Avtec. It does two things fundamentally. Number one, it expands the commercial markets we serve. It's a dispatch solution, but it actually extends us into the airport, seaport and rail markets, which are new markets for us, so we're excited there. The second thing is as we looked at our R&D portfolio, where we're planning on next generation dispatch for commercial, there were some economies in terms of bringing the company on, and we like what they're doing from a development standpoint. So very well-run company in the South Carolina. We're excited to have them as part of the family.","Keith Housum","Great. Thanks.","Gino Bonanotte","Keith, just to add while we're on the Avtec subject. For the full year, revenue expectation is approximately $20 million. And we expect it to be slightly dilutive for the full year.","Keith Housum","Sorry. Did you say $20 million or $28 million?","Gino Bonanotte","Approximately $20 million.","Keith Housum","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Greg Notter of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Greg Notter","Hi, guys. This is George. I just wanted to, I guess, dig in on the effort on the command center software business. There's a big initiative I know going on in the company around platforming those products and pushing them onto more of a SaaS model. Can you kind of talk about where you are in that transition and the integration of the different software pieces you have there? And then what kind of milestones do you have in terms of getting into a subscription-type model next year? Thanks.","Kelly Mark","Hey, George, it's Kelly. So we're making great progress on it. We've already launched a number of our products into the cloud or selling them as a service, specifically if you think about Kodiak or VaaS. So we're making good traction on that. We expect the materiality of our portfolio to be cloud-ready by the end of 2020. I will note, though, even though as we move towards cloud, our software products will continue to be available either to our customers on-prem or in the cloud. So that transition will be gated based on our customers' desire and how they want to execute on deployment. But we view it as moving along quite well with the business and the milestones we look for, which you will see in announcements like you saw this past quarter on CommandCentral aware, which is another one of our Products which we recently made available in the cloud. You'll see more of those announcement come between now and the end of 2020 as we make them available in the cloud.","Greg Notter","Got it. And what's customer receptivity like on that? Do you -- obviously, you're asking people to kind of buy product in a little bit different model there. And again, it's a customer option, but talk about sort of the circumstances under which you see customers kind of consuming that way. And how does that affect the model for you guys going forward? Thanks.","Kelly Mark","It's early days on that as we make it available. And based on the products we have right now, we've had high amount of customer receptivity to that. There are going to certainly be certain issues. We might get into -- for governments related to whether or not they actually can store their data in the cloud, which will be something that we'll look at and watch as we deploy it, but they've been relatively receptive to it. It certainly helps in regards to security and keeping the systems up-to-date and managing uptime versus when you have it and what we call an on-prem deployment. But it's early days in regards to launching that. But initially for the customers who are receptive to that, it's been going quite well.","Operator","The next question will come from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yes. Thanks. Hi, Greg, Gino. I get ask this question quite a bit from clients, which would be around command center software portfolio. You know you have kind of interesting building blocks called management, command control, records, evidence and on and on. So the question that I get asked and like to get your view is, do you have companies who compete with you across the software command center portfolio architecturally? Or is your competition more under the piecemeal, the individual building blocks? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Greg Brown","Sure. Hi, Vijay. We feel very good about the components that we have and the width and breadth of what we've acquired to include, as you referenced, 911 call handling, get dispatch, records and evidence management. And we do not believe that competitively, anyone else has the width and breadth of the suite that we are building. It's a fragmented marketplace. There's different competitors depending upon the element that's being evaluated. But I think Kelly and Andrew Sinclair and team are doing a really good job on building out the suite, cloud-enabling the portfolio and its respective components, increasing SaaS subscriptions and moving away from perpetual license. And I like our competitive position. To the earlier question by George, I think we have high interest. More customers remain interested in buying components of the suite. But given the buying habits of state and local, I think it will be gradual but that's okay. But very much like what Kelly and team are building there.","Vijay Bhagavath","Yes, perfect. A quick follow-on would be for Gino in terms of use of cash and also just the investment strategy in the company, both internal and inorganic. Thanks.","Greg Brown","Actually, Vijay, let me just jump back. Gino and I work very closely, quite frankly, the whole team on the deployment of capital. I think it's the most important thing we do. As you've seen, we've done a combination of increased organic investment, inorganic acquisitions surgically to build out the command center software suite and video assets that we think are strategic in video security and analytics and also return capital to shareholders.","Love the fact that we did -- we're able to do $145 million of share repurchase in Q1 at $118 a share. Gino has been very consistent in our capital allocation framework 50%, 30%, 20%. 50% to be used for share repurchase for acquisition, 30% dividend and 20% CapEx. Given our performance to-date, we have about $500 million approximately available to us between now and the remainder of the year, which is fungible between either share repurchase or acquisition. We also expect to pay down the short term loan associated for $400 million associated with the Avigilon acquisition we made last year. We expect to complete that by the end of the year.","Vijay Bhagavath","Thank you.","Greg Brown","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Adam Tindle","Okay. Thanks and good evening. I just wanted to start on the 2019 EPS guidance. I know it comes up by a couple of pennies but just beat Q1 by $0.15. You've got tax rate lower, share count higher, but I think the net of it is that your profit dollars assumptions are generally unchanged. So correct me if I'm wrong there. But if so, the business seems to have a lot of momentum. You're talking about strong backlog. I guess, why wouldn't forward quarters be raised a little bit more? Just talk about the thoughts to the guidance build up.","Greg Brown","So we feel very good about the year, the full year and the remainder of the year. As Gino talked about, we look at the year and our overall performance and focus on organic growth, more specifically organic growth, constant currency. So we did have a strong Q1 driven largely by a couple of orders in Fed. But we're less concerned around the individual linearity within a quarter but stick to the full year.","And we believe with overall backlog up, aged backlog comparable to slightly up for the remainder of the year that our full year guidance on top line remains prudent. I'll also remind you that we have $25 million of incremental FX headwinds from the last time we spoke that's incorporated and contemplated into our full year guidance. When we look at the EPS, it is largely a flow-through associated with the lower tax rate. But there is some, a couple of pennies associated with improved business performance overall. We love the start. We feel comfortable about our expected ability to achieve what we stated and it's performing as expected. But we think the guidance is prudent at this point in time.","Adam Tindle","Got it. That's helpful, Greg. And just as a follow-up, I think to your point, it implies continued year-over-year operating margin expansion. Just hoping that you can maybe just touch on the composition of this? I think previously, you had 100 to 200 basis points from the Product and SI segment. I know that was supposed to be more back-half weighted, but you had 40 basis points year-over-year improvement in Q1. So I'm just trying to determine if maybe the Products and SI margin expansion is down a tick and Services and Software are up a tick? Or are we still 100 to 200 on the Products and SI side?","Greg Brown","I think the software and Services operating margin is consistent with what we've told you before as is P&SI. Just to put a finer point on it, I think that probably operating margin in the 22% to 23% range for the full year seems to make the most sense at this point in time.","Adam Tindle","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks Greg.","Greg Brown","You bet.","Operator","Next question will come from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Paul Silverstein","Thanks. Appreciate you all taking the question. First off, some of your compadres in the com equipment market, albeit focus on the commercial sectors as opposed to public safety, has citied weakness in Germany and the UK and cited Brexit and cited a big downturn in the automotive industrial sector in Germany. Again, I recognize 80% of the revenue comes from pubic safety, but do you see any of that weakness? Is there any impact or visibility? And then I've got a follow-up question.","Jack Molloy ","Hey Paul, it's Jack. So with regards to -- obviously, we've seen some slowdown on the commercial side in Europe. But I would caveat and I think it's important to note that our European business is largely insulated due to the fact that we're largely a managed service company. If you think about Airwave and the other nationwide networks that we manage, we've got -- the preponderance of our business is recurring revenue in Managed and Support Services in Europe. So we -- as Greg alluded to and Gino in the opening, we had a solid Q1. We expect comparable growth to 2018 in Europe, Middle East and Africa this year.","Paul Silverstein","All right. And then if I can ask on the Avigilon piece, you had that earlier to announcement about the integrations with command and control software platform. It sounds like it's on schedule relative to when you did the deal back in early 2018. So that takes you to the public safety market. I assume that with the big firing gun in terms of entering the public safety, Avigilon, if I recall at the time of the deal, was just the commercial sector they had their hands full and trying to address the public safety market.","Greg and Gino, did that not translate to an acceleration of the revenue growth from video analytics and surveillance and the associated hardware? If I recall at the time of the deal, I think they were doing mid-teens growth. The first quarter out, you referenced acceleration. I haven't heard that reference again since, in their fourth quarter since the deal. But now that you're taking some public safety market, I would think there will be strong receptivity and that would actually accelerate the growth of that still relatively small base.","Greg Brown","Yes. I think the gating factor or in terms of going after public safety and state and local is more about channel and sales cycle. Remember, Avigilon was a commercial enterprise video company, which was great and they've done a great job. But Molloy has done a very good job of redirecting investment, mainly sales coverage and heads and the channel program to redirect it to be more public safety. So I don't think it was a product interoperability issue with command center software.","I think it's channel investment that takes time. And I think it's sales cycle on competitive RFPs that take time. We still expect strong growth to your overall point, which is why we stated upfront that we think Avigilon can grow 3x the market at about 15%. So we do expect to get more traction. But at this point, we think on a larger basis, it's prudent to leave that guidance consistently at about that level. But good progress.","Paul Silverstein","Got it. Thank you.","Greg Brown","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead.","Jim Suva","Thank you. And I have a question for Greg kind of bigger picture and then kind of a financial question for -- probably for Gino. But Greg, when you think about and just looking at the overall economy with strong employment, housing prices going higher, should lead to more inflows to government municipalities, police forces and first responders should be using your products. Is it fair to say that these are leading to more healthier discussions today for your new products?","Or is there a little bit of, I want to say diversion of police forces trying to retrain their staff to make sure that they don't end up with a black sore eye from public social media responses. And then for Gino, the question, it looks like while you're raising EPS for the full year, it looks like it's fully accounted for from the lower tax rate of 24% to 25% versus 25% earlier. So you mentioned you're also increasing your outlook due to organic, but I'm just trying to make sure that I'm not missing something. Or are you investing a little bit more?","Greg Brown","I'll just answer the second one real quickly just because I mentioned it a few minutes ago. But the tax rate difference or the lower tax rate we think is worth about $0.05 and we raised the high end from $770 to $772. So the EPS guidance raise, you're right, it's because largely of lower tax rate but not solely. There's also some business improvement that comes from that.","Gino Bonanotte","Just to add to that, Jim, keep in mind the share count change from 175 million to 176 million shares. And as mentioned earlier, the acquisition, the Avtec acquisition is slightly dilutive. As you're going through your math and model, you have to incorporate those as well. And as Greg mentioned earlier, the increase in FX, the $25 million increase in FX from FX headwinds from our prior view.","Greg Brown","And Jim, as it relates to kind of overall macroeconomics, I think the very good thing about this business among other things is the consistent demand for what we sell. Real strong economy or in a more tepid economy. We see consistent strength in North America. And also strength because the markets, the addressable markets that we're playing in have been expanded. So if you rewind the tape and you know this very well, we were more traditionally a mission-critical radio communications provider. As we continue to invest organically and inorganically, we're doing \u2013 we're playing in so many other areas beyond that. We're playing in the command center, software space with the respective components and an addressable market there that's $5 billion to $6 billion.","We're in the video, security and analytics market now with Avigilon, which we think is about $12 billion-plus, completely zeroing out China. And of course, Kelly and team continue to build out the services around that. So I think the strength and the continued performance of what we're doing is because of the width and the breadth of our product portfolio led by a healthy economy in North America but also reflecting at its fundamental base the criticality and consistent demand for land mobile radio. We talked about wins in Iowa and Pennsylvania. Historically, we had the award here in Florida. It's not contracted for yet. Airwave was extended through the end of 2022. But in a variety of different theaters where Molloy and team compete, land mobile radio demand and the criticality of mission-critical communications is pretty consistent. That's what I think is continuing to drive us along with coverage and execution. I don't know, Jack, if you want to add anything.","Jack Molloy","Just one other thing, Greg. And I think I picked up on Jim you talked about more training. And with the state of play -- with respect to state municipal funding, how is that money being prioritized. Greg made a key point. And we made inorganic and organic investments around software and video because of this. One of the trends that we're seeing, and we followed this closely with our law enforcement customers , is less people taking the test, which lends itself to increased demand for complementary technologies to give them investigative tools that they wouldn't have.","So ultimately, how do they do more with less? And the simple answer is technology. And yes, as Greg said, it's our continued demand for land mobile radio. But it's also driving and it's going to continue to drive video in command center software opportunities for us. And so that's why some of the kind of investments and bets that we've made over the last course of last three years will really start to come to pass because we have less and less law enforcement officers, they need greater technology to keep the public safe.","Jim Suva","Thank you for the detail. It's great. I appreciate it.","Jack Molloy","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Good afternoon and thanks everybody for joining us today.","I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business, before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q4 was an outstanding quarter capping another record year for the company. We grew revenue 5%, expanded operating margins by 80 basis points, generated $795 million of operating cash flow.","Additionally we ended the quarter with our highest backlog position ever of $11.3 billion, up $659 million year-over-year and up $217 million sequentially. Second, our full year 2019 results exemplify the strength of our business.","In our Products segment we grew revenue mid-single digits, driven by a second consecutive year of record land mobile radio sales in North America, as well as strong growth in our video security business.","In Software and Services, we grew revenue double digits. And expanded operating margins by 330 basis points, on strong demand for our Command Center Software solutions and continued growth in our services business.","And finally, as I look to 2020, our record backlog position coupled with the investments in our Command Center Software and video security portfolios position us well, for another year of organic revenue growth, operating margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation.","I'll now turn the call over to Gino, to provide additional details on Q4 results and 2020 outlook, before returning for some closing thoughts.","Gino Bonanotte","Thank you, Greg.","Q4 includes revenue of $2.4 billion, up 5% including $82 million of revenue from acquisitions and $17 million of currency headwinds. GAAP operating earnings of $590 million, up $74 million and operating margins of 24.8% of sales compared to 22.9% in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $707 million, up $57 million or 9% and non-GAAP operating margins of 29.7% of sales, up 90 basis points from 28.8%, driven by higher sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions.","GAAP earnings per share of $1.39 compared to $2.44 in the year ago quarter. The current year quarter includes a noncash charge of $1.53 per share related to actions taken to de-risk $1 billion in pension obligations.","Non-GAAP EPS of $2.94, up 12% from $2.63 last year on higher operating earnings and a lower effective tax rate. OpEx in Q4 was $523 million, up $40 million versus last year, primarily due to acquisitions. The Q4 effective tax rate was 22% and compared to 23.5% in the prior year.","For the full year, revenue was $7.9 billion, up 7%, driven by growth in the Americas. Revenue from acquisitions was $312 million and currency headwinds were $113 million.

Q4 operating cash flow was $795 million compared to $812 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $736 million compared with $743 million in the prior year. For the full year, operating cash flow was $1.8 billion up $748 million and free cash flow was $1.6 billion up $697 million. The increase in cash flow was driven by the impact of the $500 million pension contribution made in 2018, higher operating earnings, and improved working capital.","Capital allocation for 2019 included $709 million of acquisitions, $379 million in cash dividends and $350 million in share repurchases at an average price of $137.35. Additionally during the year, we repaid the remaining $400 million balance on the term loan used to acquire Avigilon. We refinanced approximately $800 million of senior unsecured debt extending our debt maturity profile.","We settled the initial 5-year convertible note with Silver Lake, one year ahead of its maturity and extended the relationship with a new 5-year convertible note that expires in 2024.

Products and Systems Integration operating earnings were $1.2 billion or 22% of sales, up slightly from the prior year on higher sales and gross margins, partially offset by higher OpEx related to acquisitions.","Moving to the Software and Services segment, Q4 revenue was $704 million, up $120 million or 21% from last year, driven by growth in all regions. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $44 million.

Americas Q4 revenue was $1.7 billion, up 10%, driven by broad based growth across LMR services, video security and Command Center Software. For the full year, Americas' revenue was $5.7 billion, up 12% with growth in both segments. EMEA Q4 revenue was $448 million, down 9% due to large system deployments in the Middle East and Africa in the prior year, partially offset by growth in Europe.","For the full year, EMEA revenue was $1.6 billion, down 3% due to FX headwinds and declines in the Middle East and Africa, partially offset by growth in Europe. And in Asia Pac, Q4 revenue was $214 million up, 6% or $12 million, driven by growth in Australia. For the full year, Asia Pac revenue was $657 million down 3%, driven by China and FX headwinds. ","Moving to backlog. Ending backlog was $11.3 billion, up $659 million or 6% compared to last year. Sequentially backlog was up $217 million, driven by growth in software and services.

We expect Q1 sales to be up approximately 2% with non-GAAP EPS between $1.30 and $1.35. This assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 20% and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 176 million shares. For the full year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 4% with non-GAAP EPS between $8.65 and $8.80 per share.","This full year outlook assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 23%, weighted average diluted share count between 176 million and 177 million shares and full year OpEx down $60 million versus 2019. We expect full year operating cash flow to be approximately $1.9 billion.","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg.","Greg Brown","Thanks Gino.","And let me just close with a few final thoughts. First 2019, was an outstanding year. Our land mobile radio business had a second consecutive record year in North America, while our Video Security and Command Center Software businesses both exceeded our expectations.","Second, I was particularly pleased by the performance of Software and Services during the year, which now makes up roughly one-third of our overall sales and is a proxy for our recurring revenue.","The demand for our integrated Command Center Software suite drove strong revenue. And backlog growth in our Software business, while our Services business grew mid-single digits organically, led by another strong year in North America.","Additionally, we expanded operating margins in the segment by 330 basis points, which drove overall operating margin expansion of 130 basis points for the company. And finally, I think we're very well positioned for another strong year in 2020.","We serve large addressable markets. We have a seasoned team, focused on consistent execution. And the investments we've made in North America along with our Command Center Software and video security portfolios will continue to drive organic revenue growth, operating margin expansion, EPS growth of at least 2 times revenue growth and strong free cash flow over the long-term.","I'll now turn it back over to Tim.","Tim Yocum","Thank you, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line, how to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Tim Long","Yes just one and then the follow-up, I'll give you them both you guys can pick. So first, maybe on the targets for 2021 the $9 billion in revenues and $10 in EPS, talk a little bit how we're going to get there. It seems like given the strong margins and OpEx management EPS seems a little easier than the revenues but if you could just touch on that a little bit?","And secondly, might be related that organic growth in Q1 is kind of low. I'm wondering if there's other large deals that impact that kind of like they did in Q4. And then also, looking at the 4% for the year, you do have a little bit of M&A help and you have bigger contribution from software and video. So just curious if something is going on in the LMR side of the business, when you look into the full year 2020? Thank you.","Gino Bonanotte","Yes so first, in terms of the concept of nine and 10 in 2021, I think I've been pretty consistent in saying approximately nine and approximately 10 in 2021. Tim, it's meant \u2013 it was always meant to be directional and not prescriptive or specific guidance. And as you mentioned, I think it also includes and contemplates both organic and inorganic. I think that you see the guide for both Q1 and the full year in 2020 on top of what we did in 2019 and I like the progression and the path that we're on.","You're right that if you extrapolate that out, it will likely be closer to approximately 10 on the bottom. And then on the top but again it contemplates both organic and inorganic and we'll see how that develops. In terms of Q1 specifically, I would just say that a couple of things. We're coming off of two consecutive record years. The previous year comp in Q1 of last year was 13% growth. And as we referenced and have been consistent, that included of the timing of a $40 million Fed order in Q1 that when you normalize for the timing of that, I think you feel a little bit better.","The linearity of Q1 is consistent with the last several years. It's about 20%. It\u2019s always our smallest quarter. And with the exception of the anomaly of last year, I think it's consistent and in line with the way our business generally flows. The final point I'd make too is that, are all in 4% growth for 2020 is generally balanced with a little bit less than 4% growth in the first half, 4% growth in the second half and the 4% overall numbers consistent with what I mentioned a quarter ago.","From a composition standpoint, we still expect growth overall in LMR all in with services in 2020. And we believe video security will grow again. We expect that in the 15% range and command center software in high teens. So all in all, I think balanced strong across multiple platforms, but that gives you the color of Q1 in 2020 as well as your 2021 question.","Operator","The next question will be from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Please go ahead, George. Perhaps your line is muted on your end. We\u2019ll move to our next question.","George Notter","Sorry about that?","Operator","There you go we can hear you now sir.","George Notter","Can you hear me great, apologies. All right so on Avigilon, you've been talking about a 15% growth target for 2019 to confirm you guys hit that or beat that. I am curious what that business grew for you last year. And then again you mentioned 15% kind of growth aspiration for this year again in video?","I'd love to get an update on kind of where you are in terms of investing in that business and starting to get leverage in terms of your government opportunities, international opportunities just give us an update on the progress there? Thanks.","Gregory Brown","So, just overall on the business and then Jack could comment on the investments in the any other composition of your question. But we did grow 15% actually a little bit better but so it exceeded our expectations in 2019. I'm really pleased with the acquisition. And I'm particularly pleased with Malloy, John Kedzierski, all the Avigilon team of the way it's been integrated the way we're investing, the way we're refreshing, the way we're expanding go-to-market.","And we do expect again growth around 15% for that business which I remind you is about 3x the market.","Jack Molloy","Yes the only color I'd add Greg, just in terms of the investment George we invested fairly significantly in terms of go-to-market in North America in the first quarter last year. I think that helped attribute to the momentum. As Greg indicated, we picked up in the second half of the year. The other piece of it is it's obviously a very innovation-driven market. We launched \u2013 we had a relatively large-scale launch with our AI-powered H5 camera line.","And again, the Q4 success and even what we're seeing in terms of pipeline build is very encouraging. The last piece of it as we formulated a government sales team and we did Gino made mention of it. We did $5 million in sales half of that was in the federal government market, which is really the longest selling cycle. So, all in we're encouraged in terms of the markets.","Internationally, one of the investments we're making now is really focused on routes to market, taking our go-to-market coverage and getting into new countries that Avigilon was not in when we acquired them. So I think, some work to do there but definitely, I think some opportunity as well.","Gregory Brown","Yes just George one other thing, just to complement the team, one of the verticals that I think has been the strongest-performing is education in the notion of safe schools. I think, it's been the sweet spot of demand for Avigilon. And Jack and team are going to make even more investments to expand the width and breadth of our reach in that vertical nationwide. I think its front and center with so many school systems and county-wide education systems.","This whole notion of safe students and doing the, necessary protection around perimeter and anomaly detection and motion detection. So, we're investing more in that vertical. And we're investing and integrating, the end-to-end Avigilon video, security and analytics system, integrated with our existing land mobile radio. So stay tuned on that front for more updates over time in both the education vertical and a few others. But that's been high demand for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Keith Housum","Gino a question for you just a little bit more details on the numbers. It looks like R&D stepped up quite a bit this quarter. Is that kind of a new run rate to think about that? And is there specific areas I guess you're expanding the R&D in order to capture I guess more future opportunities?","Gino Bonanotte","Yes as we talked about the increase, Keith was attributable to acquisitions. We will continue to rationalize spend. We have made incremental investments, in our growth businesses. Both Jack mentioned go-to-market as well as additional investments in R&D with the new camera as well as in command center software and we continue to drive costs out of the overall business. So I talked about a $60 million reduction, in 2020.","So what you're seeing in 2019 is really a function of the acquisitions coming on. And as we work through cost structures across the acquisitions and more so across the underlying business you'll see that come down.","Keith Housum","And then quick follow-up, in terms of the license plate reader business and the WatchGuard can you guys give a little bit color on how those acquisitions are performing for you?","Jack Molloy","Yes sure Keith its Jack so related to WatchGuard one of the encouraging things we have with WatchGuard and with VaaS is really the ability to first bundle mobile in car video with license plate recognition, software and ultimately look at those as a platform. So we've - Q4 last year we announced our 4RE, mobile video, WatchGuard, that's integrated with license recognition. That's tied to our learned database which is the biggest license plate recognition database in the market.","Early returns from customers that tell us, this gives them better evidentiary management, as well as it improves officer safety. So, we're encouraged by both of these and I'd remind you that WatchGuard is the leading player in-car video. We see more and more of the body warrant and in-car video sales being tethered together. And obviously our go-to-market scale in North America is significant. So, we really like both of those acquisitions.","Operator","The next question will be from Adam Tindle with Raymond James.","Adam Tindle","Greg, I know it's not a normal practice to talk about individual contracts, but the state of Florida LMR deal was a landmark one that you've talked about in the past as an example of kind of the threat of LTE cannibalization being overblown. It seems like some potentially unattractive terms being asked of you based on what's being reported on that and I don't think you've come to an agreement, but just hoping for a little bit more color why. I'm not sure if those terms are boiler plate. They've been agreed to in the past? And what has changed to see such a big deal that seems like it maybe falling through?","Greg Brown","Yes Adam thanks. So first of all, I mean just to paint the picture and remind everybody we did anticipate getting state of Florida. We didn't. I think it was largely a result of over 1.5 years of delays in lawsuits and appeals primarily by the incumbent competitor. On top of that there's been some administration management changes. But I think it's fair to say that there was fluidity and scope and some design assumptions.","Now having said that, we have an extensive presence throughout the state already. We still look forward to participating in what the state of Florida decides to do next. The project by the way was never in backlog, while we did anticipate signing it.","We didn't. And it was going to be a managed service, so it would have been I think about $13 million to $15 million a year over several years. I think we're going to stay engaged with the state of Florida. We would like to think there's still opportunity to reengage and participate in that going forward.","In terms of overall demand for LMR, as I mentioned, we've had two record years back-to-back we've had the state of Pennsylvania. We have the state of Iowa. And there's a whole - we had the largest LMR deal in the history of the company in Canada. So LMR is - remain strong.","And these deals are - continue to come in and they're usually accompanied with seven and 10 and 12-year maintenance contracts as well. I think the state of Florida had a lot of factors involved. We would still like to participate and hope we have a role going forward, but that's really the state of play at this point in time.","Adam Tindle","And just as a follow-up kind of circling back on some of the things that you said in the prepared remarks at the end. The 2020 guidance I think implies somewhere around low double-digit operating profit dollar growth on 4% revenue growth. I know that leverage is something that you've done in years past but largely through a lot of cost optimization programs. And I think the composition of profit dollar growth and leverage is becoming more a function of scaling the software and services piece.","So I'm hoping that maybe you could just touch on that dynamic the change in composition of profit dollar growth and leverage and double-click on where you see software and services margins moving to in 2020.","Greg Brown","So, there was a lot, but we still think the business can - we expect it to grow all in 4%. We do think that video security solutions will grow at 15% Command Center Software in the high-teens.","As I've commented before, as it relates to China, our China revenue continues to fall off largely as expected, in an accelerated way, just to contextualize that Mainland China was about $120 million of revenue in 2019.","I think that's going to be cut in half, in 2020, more pronounced, not unanticipated, but more pronounced and reflective of our strategy around China. And we've been deemphasizing that theater for the last several years.","So, I think we will A, continue to grow organically. I think LMR continues to grow all in inclusive of services the video security and command center software. I mentioned, services will grow should grow mid-single digits.","From an operating leverage standpoint, as Gene mentioned we think OpEx goes down $60 million, largely normalized and optimized from G&A rationalization from acquisitions made previously. But Software and Services will continue to grow high single digit.","That's what we anticipate. And from an operating margin standpoint I think that Software and Services will be about 33%, expanding over 2019. And we would see and anticipate the product segment operating margin expanding as well.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Suva with Citi Investment Research.","Jim Suva","Just one clarification, then kind of a more detailed strategy question. And the clarification question is, if I got my memory correct, which it could very well be wrong.","The long-term guidance that you gave of the $9 billion sales and $10 in EPS, not guidance, but say let's call it, goal or whatever for 2021, that does include unannounced M&A?","But for the 2020 guidance for this year, the sales of 4% plus or minus on the EPS that does not include unannounced M&A that hasn't been announced yet? So that's kind of my clarification question.","Then my strategy question, Greg, when you look at running the company for 2020 what's kind of the maybe one or two variables to the upside or downside that you're taking a look at, whether it's state budgets or there are a couple of big contract renewals from competitors or within yourself that come up for renewal? Just so we can think about some of the key factors you're looking at for 2020. Thank you.","Greg Brown","Sure. So Jim your memory is correct. The approximate nine and 10 does contemplate future acquisitions. And you're also correct, that our 2020 guidance that we're confirming today does not, so you're right on that front.","In terms of kind of overall levels and thinking about 2020, I like the fact that we have record backlog. I like the fact that more of the revenue is dimensionalized toward a recurring theme, vis-\u00e0-vis software and services.","I'm really pleased with Kelly Mark and Andrew Sinclair and Jack Molloy and John Kedzierski. And I don't say that conveniently or to be nice and give the commercial for those guys. They've done an excellent job on two of these growth strategies that are very critical to us going forward.","And at the same time, land mobile radio all in continues to be steady product and services and will grow. The variables you always think about is there a geopolitical event that could happen? Maybe, who knows? The coronavirus is relatively - maybe it isn't early in its stages. We'll see. We don't think that impacts us at this point in time.","But we'll see how that plays out. This is also an election year and sometimes, if there's a change in administration that could provide a temporary pause or dislocation. I don't know if that's 2020 or 2021. But that's going to be an interesting set of dynamics to watch that whole political theater unfold.","I think overall state budgets in the U.S. are solid. I think the U.S. federal budgets are solid. We've talked about tailwinds with the National Defense Authorization Act. FX is very muted for us in 2020. As we sit here today maybe $10 million of headwind. So, I think our guidance and our view is balanced, prudent, but I like the underlying strength of the business, the performance drivers and the execution by which we're achieving.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Ben Bollin","I wanted to start, if you could just talk specific to public sector surveillance opportunities. Historically, it seems like Avigilon has disproportionately been weighted towards enterprise. How do you feel about the progress you are making? What's the visibility on large deal opportunities as it relates to public sector customers?","John Molloy","Ben, its Jack. So we've - I made a comment earlier that we put a team that was specifically focused at state and local. Really when we think about local it's local it's citywide video security systems. I think we've talked about before that we manage the city of Chicago. But just last year, we had opportunities that we won in Cleveland and in Dallas as well. So we've got opportunities.","We've got relationships. I'm actually very encouraged. What we typically see with citywide safe city opportunities that they typically do a pilot in an area particularly in the central business district or an area that's very hard by crime and build out. So they are kind of elegant thing. When we secure those deals there's a scalability that will happen in 20 - this year 2020 and 2021 as they make sustained investments in those networks as well.","Ben Bollin","And looking at command center, where do you think customers are in their PSAT modernization efforts. Is it still ultra early innings and things get a lot better from here, just any high-level thoughts on where that market is and its evolution?","Kelly Mark","Ben, its Kelly. I think it's still early innings on the PSAT modernization. Certainly, we're starting to see some moves with some of the larger cities out there in regards to building into the ESN as you probably heard us talk about it which is the more advanced way to bring multimedia to 911 call centers, but I'd say that's still early innings.","The impact of that eventually, it will drive churn of software because they'll have to update the software which sort of sits downstream from that 911 call to be able to handle the multimedia, but that also falls within the normal budget cycle that they have to prioritize. So it's not as if it will drive a tremendous acceleration, but certainly something that we'll see happen over the next many years.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Coster with JPMorgan.","Paul Coster","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Can you break out the full year growth by region give us some sense of how - if there's any differences between the regions? ","Jack Molloy","Yes. Paul, its Jack. Well, when you think about it North America last year we grew 13% in 2019; 7% in constant currency this year in 2020. And by the way, I do want to note North America, it's particularly important that we grew across LMR had tremendous success in Command Center Software as well as in our video security business. We actually expect continued growth across all platforms. We expect growth in North America in the federal government area in Canada as well as in the U.S. and state and local.","As we think about Europe, EMEA last year we had a - it's important to note EMEA was down in 2019, 3%. Most of that was driven really by a culmination of two things: two deals in the Middle East; two nationwide deployments, one in Northern Africa and one in the Middle East that created a tough comp. Also we were in a tough FX environment last year, but we did grow in Europe both in Eastern Europe and Western Europe. And in 2020 we expect the region in whole to grow not only in Europe, but the Middle East and Africa as well.","And then lastly in Asia Pac. And I think Greg made mention this is we expect Asia Pac to decline slightly this year. And really that's driven by the fact that our revenue in China will be cut in half. The rest of Asia Pac is fairly stable for us, but it's just the planned continued deterioration of revenue in China that really impacts Asia Pac. ","Paul Coster","And Greg, I'd take your point that the change in the administration might cause a pause in spending. What happened in prior presidential cycles that you can call out as material if anything? ","Greg Brown","Well, I mean, I think just in general whether it's Republican or Democrat it wasn't meant to be a partisan comment. But whenever there's a change there's typically you go through a new cycle they appoint new people and cabinet members, they reconstruct the budget. There may or may not be a continuing resolution. The budget details need to be solidified which really are foundational to what they will spend the first few quarters after the election. I think that's what we've experienced in the past. ","Gino Bonanotte","I think that's exactly right. The other piece of it is just what happens in the House and Senate and are there changes there that might change budget priorities as well. But as Greg said it's not - we've had very good years in Democratic administrations and very good years in Republican administrations. It's really just how quickly can get can they get the agency heads in place that can start to set the wheels in motion for both our customers and our team. ","Operator","The next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. ","Paul Silverstein","Appreciate that this might have been asked in different forms. But if I remember correctly last year you spoke about gross margin uplift being the largest driver of operating margin uplift with OpEx being relatively flattish, but not down and you delivered on that. This year you're talking about OpEx declining once again by $60 million. I don't think I heard you referenced gross margin. If you did I apologize. What should we expect from gross margin relative to the opportunity for operating margin uplift for incremental leverage?","Gino Bonanotte","Yes, Paul, this is Gino. We did not mention it, but really the expectation from - in the product segment is for gross margins to be comparable to what they were in 2019 and continued expansion in software and services from 2019 into 2020. ","Paul Silverstein","And as a follow-up, I appreciate that both of you have done a very good job trying to herd the cats and keep expectations in line. So Greg and you will apologize if this goes in the other direction. But you're telling us that you expect China to be down by $60 million or so to get cut in half.","So starting out if we normalize for China, your organic growth, your normalized growth looks more like 5%. And I'm asking obviously a longer-term question here. And then if I think about the growth you're putting up in command and control software and video of 15 to high teens as those grow as a percentage of revenue and as LMR comes down as a percentage of revenue that should obviously have an uplift long-term on growth all the things being equal.","I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this the right way if we think about longer-term growth as you go forward in time. I appreciate large numbers. But when I look at what's going on in your business, it sounds like growth should actually trend up over time?","Greg Brown","Well, so kind of a couple of things. In the context of 2020, we went through that. I appreciate the question and I understand where you're coming from. You are right that over time as software and services and video security obviously Command Center Software that are growing substantially faster and become a greater from a contribution standpoint that should provide lift both from a growth rate and an organic growth rate. And we would anticipate that trend over time. We're only guiding for 2020.","The China being cut in half is much more pronounced. So China was down $20 million in 2019 against 2018. It's much more pronounced this year. It's not unexpected. I think it's related to a lot of the things we've been doing and decisions that we've made proactively with China. So that's not unanticipated.","But also I think in the context of the overall guidance, I think it's appropriate to be prudent. By the way some of this growth remember, the other trend here is incrementally things that were sold as CapEx that might roll to the top line growth number to take 3 to 4 to 5 to 6 go more toward annuity revenue multi-year annual recurring.","So as we move some product to incremental annual recurring revenue that would temper down top line growth as we transition over time, but enhance the longevity and durability and predictability of the cash flow. So there's -- it's that dynamic as well. But all-in, pleased with where we are record backlog, high-growth businesses performing and LMR as well. Remember coming off two record years that's important to understand. And the LMR business being longer sales cycle and a little bit lumpy in nature. 2020 is reflective of that, but that too is still growing all-in with services. ","Paul Silverstein","Greg I appreciate the response. To be clear I was looking for you to change the 2020 guidance, it was in the longer-term and prepare it correctly?","Greg Brown","Yes. No, no, I know, I appreciate it. And I totally understand where you're coming from.","Operator","The next question is from Fahad Najam with Cowen.","Fahad Najam","I wanted to see if you can address something that hasn't really come up lately is the opportunity in the public LTE or private LTE space for you guys. I assume that with your video increased growing portfolio of video services that is a synergy with your private LTE offerings. Can you speak to any incremental deployments you've had with your private LTE offerings?","Jack Molloy","Fahad, its Jack and it's a good question. If you think about our LTE offerings, historically, we've got a couple of things. We've talked about FirstNet. We think there are muted expectations for FirstNet in North America. But LTE to the enterprise is where we've got significant opportunity. We announced a CBRS portfolio last March at our channel partner Expo. We won some of our first deals with a big health care system out west. So we're encouraged by that.","We also have a 900 megahertz offering to the utility space that we announced last week, at Distributech. And think of this as being something that actually takes advantage of existing P25 footprint. So less sites, better return on investment for utilities, leverages higher power capabilities and in SP25 and essentially LTE capabilities standing side-by-side. The last thing is LTE it will be an enabler for APX Next device which is our public safety police fire EMS device targeted.","And that if you remember that's got P25 capabilities. But also it will have 5G capabilities, resident in the device, that's going to have LMR flow through capabilities there. So, really it's coming at a number of different things, device opportunities in public safety, and some software opportunities in public safety on FirstNet. And then in infrastructure as well as device opportunities in the enterprise space, namely utilities and health care et cetera.","Fahad Najam","I appreciate it. And if I could maybe ask you about the competitiveness of your video products, one of your competitors had talked about their wins at Fresno and Cincinnati. But I just want to understand how competitively products are coming together. You've got WatchGuard and your other video platform. Can you speak to the competitiveness and improved competitiveness of your product offerings relative to your competitors?","Jack Molloy","Yes. I think, end-to-end our video business is obviously as you mentioned we've got a fixed video security analytics business and Avigilon. It's the only end to end game in town. Everything from AI-powered cameras at the edge to video management systems to - a part that we don't talk about a lot and that's access control, Greg talked a little bit earlier about education and I think access control is every bit as important to our story as we secure campuses and the like.","When we think about our video business in the public safety and I talked about earlier, again we're the only one we got the only ones at an end-to-end story there. We've got not only on body. We're the leading in car video provider. But we've also got LPR capabilities. But more importantly, our learn database is the most robust database in play and content matters.","As you well know, we've got over 20 billion plates in the system. So, we think we're pulling the story together. We've actually consolidated our sales teams in public safety directed at video, because through the acquisitions we had different people point in different places. We've aggregated those teams have them under a central leader now and we're focused on getting after the public safety space. But I think from the innovation standpoint from our portfolio we've got everything we need to execute.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Sami Badri","On your video win in the quarter that was for $5 million. And I appreciate some of the comments you gave regarding your federal sales team that has been ramping up. But was this in any way related to the NDAA policy or did the NDAA policy went to your advantage to win this actual conduct or was this completely unrelated to the NDAA policy that actually boxed out some of the Chinese vendors?","Jack Molloy","Sami, the NDAA I think we've dimensionalized it as being a tailwind to our business. It's created a favorable environment for Avigilon. But I would tell you I think it's more of a result of having the right portfolio, the right focus and the right relationships and the ability to navigate the federal government sales cycle. I'd probably attribute more of success to Mark McNulty and Jim Mears and their teams and getting after that business. I think that's it. Yes.","Greg Brown","Yes. And the only other thing I'd add on the video again as you think about the video assets we've acquired and aggregated in 2019 they're roughly all in about $700 million in revenue. That includes fixed video, in car video, body-worn video, license plate recognition video. We feel very good about the end-to-end system orientation strong AI edge analytics. And then we take those and integrate them into our incumbency around land mobile radio for a pretty powerful ecosystem around mission-critical communications and analytics. So that's the path we're on.","Sami Badri","And then one follow-up is, if you look at the - all your comment center contracts that you've been signing and winning over every quarter, has the average size of these contracts from a dollar perspective started getting larger or is it very in line on a quarterly basis? Or was it very in line in 4Q 2019 versus the prior three quarters?","Kelly Mark","Sami, it's Kelly. We are seeing the contracts start to get a bit larger as we see the bundles and the suites, certainly referencing a couple of large ones as we did in the earnings materials with Irvine. So as we see the customers step in rather than just buy a point product like CAD or records, they're now bundling more and more together. So that will lead to a bit more of an influx in regards to the size of those happen.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session.

Mr. Dunlap, you may begin your conference.","Shep Dunlap - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our 2015 Second Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President and CFO; Mark Moon, Executive Vice President, President of Sales; Bob Schassler, Executive Vice President, Solutions and Services. Greg and Gino will review our results along with commentary. Mark and Bob will join us for Q&A.","We posted an earnings presentation and news releases at our website motorolasolutions.com\/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, which we encourage you to refer to. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in this morning's earnings news release and the comments made during the call, in the risk factors section of our 2014 annual report 10-K and in other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Greg.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Shep. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I'd like to make a few opening comments about the second quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook.","First, Q2 was another solid quarter. North America grew 5%, marking its third consecutive quarter of growth and the overall business grew 2% when adjusting for foreign exchange. Operational execution continues to drive improved profitability and cash flow generation as reflected in our double-digit growth of EPS and double-digit growth in free cash flow per share.","Second, our growing backlog and strong pipeline illustrate the confidence our customers have in choosing our technology solutions. We posted a third consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth, ending the quarter with a record $6 billion of backlog and a healthy pipeline moving forward.","Third, I'm very pleased to announce that Silver Lake will make a $1 billion strategic investment in our company that we will use to further accelerate growth in our Smart Public Safety Solutions and Services. And finally, we announced our intent to commence a $2 billion tender offer, representing a significant step toward further improving our capital structure. This accelerated return of capital reflects our continued confidence in the future growth of the company.","I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide some additional details on Q2 before returning to provide additional context with respect to our strategic announcements made this morning.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Greg. Second quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, down 2% versus Q2 2014. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 2%. Additionally, orders were up 11% year-on-year and ending backlog is up $624 million versus last year. GAAP operating earnings were $254 million, while non-GAAP operating earnings were $260 million or 19% of sales, a 460-basis-point improvement from the year-ago quarter.","GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.72 compared to $0.30 in the second quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.68, which represents 45% year-over-year growth. This growth was driven primarily by our cost savings and simplification initiatives. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.","Product segment Q2 sales were $867 million, down 2% versus the prior year, up 1% when adjusting for currency impact. Q2 Product segment operating income was $176 million or 20.3% of sales, up $43 million versus the prior-year quarter driven by our cost reduction actions. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $138 million versus last year and up $48 million sequentially, reflecting the fifth consecutive quarterly increase. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. As expected, we saw a decrease in Europe backlog as we continue to deploy the Norway countrywide system.","Turning to Services, Q2 Services revenue was $501 million, down 1%. Excluding the impact of currency, the Services business grew 4%. Services operating income was $84 million or 16.8% of revenue, up $16 million from the prior-year quarter. Lower operating expenses drove the profitability improvement. Services gross margin was 33.5%, in line with our expectations for Q2. Services backlog is $4.7 billion, up $486 million versus last year and up $125 million sequentially as customers continue to sign long-term service contracts to upgrade, maintain and manage their network.","Moving to operating expenses, total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $393 million, down $69 million or 15% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost reduction activities as well as a stronger dollar. These reductions were significant across all categories, with the largest savings coming from G&A. As of the end of Q2, we are now on a run rate to deliver savings of approximately $175 million versus 2014. We believe our business is well-positioned to deliver solid operating leverage.","Other operating and expense in Q2 was $39 million compared to $40 million in the year-ago quarter. Our Q2 effective tax rate was approximately 35%. We continue to expect the full-year 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%. We also continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% through 2019.","Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations in the second quarter was $140 million, an increase of $22 million or 19% versus last year. Free cash flow was $92 million. The improvement in cash generation was primarily driven by improved profitability. We remain on track for approximately $1 billion of operating cash flow and $800 million of free cash flow for the full year.","We ended Q2 in a net debt position of $285 million. In Q2, we repurchased $285 million of stock at an average price of $61.63 per share, while paying out $72 million in dividends. We also announced this morning that we intend to commence a tender offer to repurchase up to $2 billion of our share. This is a significant step in improving the efficiency of our balance sheet, while maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. And it's consistent with our belief that buying back our stock represents an excellent opportunity, given our view of company value and future growth.","Turning to our outlook, we expect total company sales for Q3 to decline 1% to 3%, which corresponds to flat to up 2% including the impact of currency, which we expect to be approximately $50 million. We expect non-GAAP EPS between $0.68 and $0.73.","Moving to the full year, our outlook remains unchanged. We continue to expect full-year 2015 sales to be flat to down 2%, which translates to 1% to 3% growth in constant currency terms. And we continue to expect full-year non-GAAP EPS of $3.20 to $3.40.","Moving on to regional results, as mentioned by Greg, our North America business continues to execute, posting the third consecutive quarter of growth at 5% for the second quarter. We expect North America to show modest growth for the full-year 2015 with a healthy backlog. Latin America was down as expected versus tough comparables, including one large deal in the prior year as well as an expected iDEN decline. Challenging macroeconomic conditions as well as the impact of a stronger dollar continue to temper expectations for the year.","The Europe and Africa region was down 15% in total, but just 2% when excluding $29 million of currency impact. We expect this region to experience headwinds of currency pressure and the nationwide Norway project transitioning from deployment to long-term managed services. Despite these near-term hurdles, we remain confident in our competitive positioning and long-term opportunities in this region.","Turning to Asia-Pac. The business has stabilized, growing at 4% in constant currency. Backlog in this region is up $97 million or 16% and our pipeline is stronger. We expect Asia-Pacific to show growth in the second half of this year. Finally, our Middle East region is going strong double-digits and backlog is up over 100% versus the year-ago quarter to $418 million. Our Public Safety LTE business continues to gain traction and attract customer interest, while our LMR business is also growing robustly.","I'd also like to share some segment highlights and key initiatives. Our Product business continues to execute on innovating for customer needs with a shift towards software enablement, while also improving operational performance. This is reflected in the segment's healthy gross margin and lower OpEx, which drove strong profitability of 20.2%.","An example of innovation that's driving growth and bolstering gross margin includes a major order for the newly released APX8000, which is seeing strong demand. This new radio platform integrates Wi-Fi broadband and LMR into a single device, while also integrating four different radio bands to provide interoperability as well as high voice quality. By integrating Wi-Fi, customers are able to more effectively add new features and functionality via over-the-air software loads.","Another example of innovative solutions solving specific customer needs is the launch of our new line of intrinsically safe TETRA radios, specifically built for hazardous working conditions found in our target verticals of oil and gas, fire and rescue, mining and airports.","There are a number of proof points that illustrate operational efficiency improvements in the business resulting in lower OpEx structure. For example, we have streamlined R&D by reducing various testing labs from 19 to 5, shifted resources to lower-cost worksites, and we're on track to reduce SKUs 40% by year-end 2015.","Throughout the quarter, we won key customer deals that highlight this customer-focused innovation and software enablement such as a $12.5 million purchase by the U.S. Army for WAVE software that will be used by all the programs in the Army Program Executive Office C3T. WAVE is our application that converts radio communications into voice-over-IP, which allows a user with authorization and a voice-enabled IP device to participate in voice communications regardless of the network or device.","$66 million of wins with four customers in the oil and gas and utility industries covering both P25 and TETRA technologies, targeted devices with unique software features position our solution as long-term investments for our customers.","Shifting to Services, the Services segment continues to show solid growth in constant currency terms. Our core integration services are executing well and we're encouraged by the opportunities underlying the key growth areas of lifecycle support, managed services and Smart Public Safety Solutions.","Lifecycle services encompasses our upgrade agreements for system refreshes and maintenance of both hardware and software. We continue to see growth and strong adoption in software maintenance agreements. Some examples of larger wins include multi-year contracts for $19 million in Hong Kong, $13 million in Quebec and $8 million in Pennsylvania.","Managed services continues to be an area of focus for growth. During Q2, we booked orders for several long-term deals, including two contracts totaling $68 million that span over 20 years of operations in managed services in Austria and a $20 million extension to an existing contract in Australia. Additionally in Q2, we launched the North America Managed Services Network Operations Center and have since transitioned customers into that NOC, providing unmatched expertise and scale.","Other notable Smart Public Safety wins include a computer-aided dispatch contract for $14 million in the U.S. and a $9 million contract in Australia. Our Emergency CallWorks acquisition is executing well, having secured six new customers this quarter and helping to expand our reach into next-generation, IP-based command-and-control centers. Additionally, we added a partnership with Wynyard, which in conjunction with our acquisition of PublicEngines, will enhance our Smart Public Safety offering.","Finally, our Public Safety LTE efforts continue to move forward as planned. The existing deployments are on schedule and we still expect Public Safety LTE revenue of approximately $100 million for this year.","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Gino. So in addition to a solid quarter, as we mentioned, we announced an important partnership with Silver Lake. We believe this strategic investment is an endorsement of our strategy and a strong vote of confidence in our future growth opportunities.","The partnership combines Silver Lake's technology expertise and track record with our brand, market reach, and Public Safety technology platforms around the world. This investment also matches the largest single PIPE investment that Silver Lake has ever done. I'm pleased that Silver Lake managing partners Egon Durban and Greg Mondre will be appointed to the Motorola Solutions Board of Directors. They both have a history of driving growth, creating value and bringing teams together to identify and deliver unique business opportunities in the technology industry.","Today, we also announced our intention to commence a tender offer to repurchase up to $2 billion of common stock. This represents an important step towards significantly improving our balance sheet and returning more capital to shareholders, and is incremental to the $8.7 billion in share repurchase and $1.1 billion in dividends that we've returned over the past four years. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow allows us to maintain our investment-grade rating and our ability to drive the growth of our business through strategic acquisitions and investments in innovation. This accelerated return of capital reflects our confidence in the growth prospects and future value of the company.","So in closing, Q2 was another solid quarter of outperformance relative to our sales and earnings expectations as we performed well on a number of measures including revenue growth in North America as well as the Middle East. We continue to position this business for improved operating leverage and significant earnings power as we grew backlog for a third straight quarter and we're now on target to deliver approximately $175 million in cost savings for the year.","And finally, today's announcements represent not only our conviction in the durability of our business and its earnings and cash generation potential, but the power of our platforms and another important step in accelerating growth in Smart Public Safety Solutions and Services. In aggregate, we're confident and encouraged about the future of our company and our growth strategy and the value creation we can deliver.","And I'll now turn it back over to Shep.","Shep Dunlap - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks. Before we begin taking questions, I would like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up so we can accommodate as many people as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to pose a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Just on the question if you could just talk a little bit about the visibility the rest of the year, I think that full-year guidance implies similar to last year with a pretty big fourth quarter. So I understand backlog is up, so is that mostly a backlog-driven number? Or how should we think about risk into Q4?","And then the clarification just a little bit more on the gross margin side. It seems like there's some positive developments on the Product side most likely offsetting a little bit of mix shift. But we've been a few years of seeing the gross margin come down. Gino, if you can talk a little bit about what we could see to get that gross margin line moving back up, that would be great. Thank you.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll take the first question first, on visibility in the second half. As you mentioned, the first half to second half linearity, it's approximately the same as it was last year. From a backlog perspective, Q3 and Q4 is slightly below what our historic average has been, really given the over-performance in Q2, backlog that we anticipated being in the second half, shipments in the second half reflected in Q2 actuals. So with the over-performance in Q2, we remain confident on the full year and the full year outlook.","With respect to gross margin, as we've talked about in the Q4 call and the Q1 call, the gross margin has been affected largely around systems integration in the Services segment, predominantly related to a couple large project deployments that have been occurring, Q4, Q1. We saw a little bit of an improvement in Q2. We continue to expect Services gross margin longer-term to be in the 35%, mid-30% range, approximately 35% and the Product gross margin is stable despite some currency headwinds.","Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Joe Del Gaudio - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. This is Joe Del Gaudio standing for Pierre. I had a couple of questions. One is, in addition to the $2 billion you mentioned in buyback and tender offer, are you expecting to buy anything else in the open market on a regular basis in addition to that? And the second question is, if you can comment a bit on your guidance for next quarter, it seems a bit conservative and low in terms of sequential growth. Thank you.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...question first. The \u2013 what we've guided to at the end of Q1 was approximately $600 million to $650 million a quarter, representing about $2.5 billion of buyback. Inclusive of the $2 billion tender, we now intend to repurchase approximately $3.5 billion in 2015. So after the legal cooling-off period at the conclusion of the tender, we expect to be back in the open market.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And Q3 guidance?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Q3 guidance, I'm not sure if you were referencing top line or bottom line, so I'll address both. Q3 guidance top line, clearly over-performance versus expectations. Our expectations in Q2 is driving some of that. And from an earnings perspective, it's really similar to Q2 and the incremental sales and associated gross margin driving the EPS range.","Joe Del Gaudio - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, Greg and Gino. Nice quarter. I guess another question on the Silver Lake capital. Should we view that as specifically being earmarked for acquisitions? Or I guess the other way to answer that is, should we think about it any differently in terms of how the balance sheet will look or how the cash balance will look exiting next year than we would've thought about it previously?","And then in terms of LTE, the revenue rec of $100 million this year, remind me, I've kind of lost track in terms of what's been announced on LTE. Where would that leave you in terms of LTE backlog exiting this year? Thanks.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","...LTE first. We still estimate that we will achieve the approximately $100 million in Public Safety LTE revenue in this year. We expect \u2013 we'll be focused on the existing deployments and revenue derived from them, the two in the Middle East and in LA. So while we're not guiding for next year, we expect the Public Safety LTE revenue in 2016 to expand at a reasonable clip of which details will follow.","On Silver Lake, Gino talked about our balance sheet. So we are in a net debt position exiting Q2. We clearly have a lot of capacity in capital, hence our intention to commence a tender. And even after the share repurchase that Gino outlined, which could be as much as $3.5 billion this year all-in, we have firepower remaining given the earnings and cash flow generation of the business moving forward to do more. I think Silver Lake brings us organic and inorganic opportunity and we will continue to look at acquisitions that may make sense, particularly in software or Smart Public Safety and Services. So, I think it strengthens our hand pretty nicely.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And if I could have an operational follow-up. The Europe business, obviously you're lapping tough comps. Number one, is there anything else going on there besides tough comps? And then secondly, do have enough visibility into the rev rec from the backlog to have a feeling of when that geography could stabilize or start to grow again?","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Europe\/Africa has done great for us in the prior three-year periods. It does have macroeconomic headwinds today as well as the biggest project we've ever had in the history of the company for Norway as it starts to wind down. So, it was just about negative 1% or negative 2% normalized for FX. I still think that Manuel and the team are doing a nice job all in both on the system side as well as professional commercial radio. As we think about going into next year, there will be a more significant wind-down of Norway's revenue recognition, probably about $80 million of revenue headwinds out of that region in 2016 over this prior-year period. But overall we feel good about the opportunities that are in front of us.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you. This is Greg (25:59) for Paul. I appreciate taking my question. Just two quick questions, on the FX impact to revenue, can you just talk about the pricing impact, specifically is discounting more of a factor in the past quarter than it has been? And then around the OpEx tailwind from FX, can you provide some clarity on numbers or some type of contribution? Thank you.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. The FX impact on pricing depends on regional specifics. There is some impact in Latin America on pricing. We haven't really seen any margin erosion or ASP reductions, so we've been containing the FX pressure at least on pricing. With respect to the FX impact in budgets, I think was the second question, obviously interrelated, both questions. What we've said in the past is that we expected an EPS impact of about $0.05 to $0.10 for the year with respect to currency movement, with FX impacting BGM or reducing \u2013 the $175 million reduction year-over-year in cost, approximately a third of that is a result of the stronger dollar.","If we look at our BGM profile, about 40% of it right now is denominated in something other than USD. So in conjunction with the Services business and our efforts around moving to low-cost centers, we've built in a hedge for FX movement, so it really doesn't impact the bottom line as much as it does the top line.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that on the revenue FX impact, it's about $50 million in Q2. We anticipate it being about $50 million in Q3, and on the full year, given the spot rate, it's about $190 million. I think that the only other thing I'd comment is, I think the more pronounced FX pressure have been a contributory factor to the compressed results in Latin America in particular. But we're managing it accordingly and it's incorporated into the overall guidance we're providing.","Mark Moon - Executive Vice President and President, Sales & Marketing","And along that line, as we continue to monitor pricing, ASPs have been holding, as Gino indicated, so we haven't really seen it affect product pricing, so to say, as Greg mentioned, just really the buying power because of Latin America being U.S. dollar-denominated for our projects and the impact of the currency there locally.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. This is Ashwin on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the discussion around Silver Lake. Back in February, you guys already talked about some of the growth initiatives in the Services segment and some of the focus areas for you. I was wondering if you kind of identified new areas of initiatives or new technologies that you need to develop that correlate to this partnership with Silver Lake.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that \u2013 good question. Thank you. As we said in February, we're emphasizing Smart Public Safety Solutions as well as Services. And I think the Silver Lake partnership is right in the sweet spot of extending and accelerating our existing strategy in this regard. I think they bring significant expertise in technology products and information solutions. They're smart, they're savvy, I think they'll help us on surgical M&A as well, both in terms of looking at the funnel of opportunity and executing on good deals potentially to supplement and complement what we already have there. We've been acquiring already. We did an analytics company a few months ago. We did a command-and-control software company with Emergency CallWorks, that's gone very well. We did a push-to-talk interoperable software company with Twisted Pair. So I think Silver Lake will \u2013 I think of it \u2013 them as accelerating and extending what we already have. We're bringing in new talent into the company. We have a new CIO and many of the people in IT are new. Tom Guthrie, who runs Smart Public Safety Solutions, has come in through an acquisition with Twisted Pair. I feel very good about the relationship, the capacity and the technology savvy that I think will be complementary to what we're doing already.","Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is it fair to characterize this as \u2013 your strategy as going after more tuck-in acquisitions rather than making any big ones?","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that's probably fair, but I would say that if there's something more material and it's compelling and accretive, we'll consider that, too, so exciting times for what we're doing going forward.","Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. Just last question on public, on police video, do you see that as a growth opportunity maybe next year or even later? And do you think you need \u2013 do you have all the technologies necessary to benefit from any spending there?","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Just to make sure I understood, was your question around video?","Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, police video.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think video is a very compelling opportunity for us in many ways. I mean, you see front-and-center all of the rhetoric and narrative around body cameras and capturing video information at an incident with first responders, combining it with their communications. Video is one of the critical components in our Smart Public Safety Solutions strategy, not just the edge devices that may capture it, but the analytics aggregation, dissemination and pushing of that data and the high-bandwidth video into a first responder to a full-fledged complementary converged device. So I think video is very important to what we're doing going forward. I see it as growing in importance. And I think that will be also front-and-center with the value proposition that we engage Silver Lake on.","Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks very much. A clarification first, if you can just comment on the split of infrastructure versus device sales for the quarter in terms of their growth trajectory. And then it looks like you're well on your way to hitting or even maybe exceeding the $175 million OpEx savings for this year. Can you comment on the potential for that number to go higher both for this year and then any incremental opportunities for savings into next year or do you feel like you've largely exhausted the opportunity for savings once you get through this program?","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think on the cost side first, I think I would characterize the $175 million of cost reductions this year as probably in the seventh or eighth inning of our journey on cost reductions. Clearly, the majority of them are behind us. And I think the team has done a really good job, not just cutting expense but restructuring the business in a more thoughtful and simple way, doing things that we don't need to do after selling the enterprise business, getting after footprint, capacity, requirement, duplication. There might be a little bit more there going forward. We'll always be prudent on looking at the cost structure. But as we pivot now, and especially with today's announcement with Silver Lake, I think of this company's trajectory going forward more about growth, more about investment and more about expansion.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Simona, this is Gino. On the device versus infrastructure, devices in Q2 contracted slightly, and infrastructure was up, systems were up. Importantly, though, devices in North America were up. The contraction's really due to Latin America and the other geographies, not North America.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Gino. And infrastructure in North America, was that up as well?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan (sic) [Brian] Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, guys. So I guess we can also look at Silver Lake investment today as really kind of a change in strategy. At one point, you'd been considering potential sale of the business. Looking at this, clearly you're moving in the direction of growing your business. Is that a fair statement?","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think that's a fair statement. I think our focus has always been on growing the business and adding capacity and competency. I think, Brian, it's a logical extension of the path that we've outlined, which is: optimizing our balance sheet, which is a big part of today; improving the operating and the financial performance of the company, which is also a big part of today; building backlog, which gives us momentum for growth. So, I look at this as a continuation of what's been my focus and management's focus, which is growing this company.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then could you give me an update on FirstNet, where you see that standing? And then also, can you talk about your view of the importance of lower frequency radios and their stickiness to the business relative to perhaps the idea of using voice-over-IP over LTE at some point in the future as your main communication source for voice? Thanks.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. On FirstNet, I think we continue to work very closely with them. We're actively participating and engaging with them through the draft RFP process. By their own articulation, I think this will carry forward into an RFP, another RFP, by the end of the year or early next year. And I think that \u2013 I think their whole initiative will be very measured and elongated, and we're staying closely in touch with them along the way.","As a sidebar, in terms of LA-RICS and that Public Safety LTE deployment, I think we remain on track. And Bob Schassler and his team have done a nice job accelerating what we need to get implemented by the requisite deadlines of that contract.","In terms of your last point on voice-over-LTE, we've been specific in pointing out that there's voice-over-LTE and then there's mission-critical voice-over-LTE. And we believe that mission-critical voice communications that are embedded in these private networks for LMR have a long, long life. And Public Safety LTE, if you will, and instantiations therein are additive to the LMR business both domestically and internationally. So we feel good about our position, and we'll monitor it going forward.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for the question. I joined a bit late, so maybe this was answered. But I just wanted to clarify what's the best way of understanding the seasonality of operating margins in Q3 and Q4 because I was previously under the kind of impression that Q3 gets back and Q4 rises and Q2 dips. But that doesn't sound like that's how you wanted to model it this year. So is it something that happened in Q2 that we should be aware of that helped margins maybe? That's the first question.","Second one is once this tender offer on share repurchases is done, what's the best way of thinking about the ongoing buybacks? You were kind of modeling it more smoothly through the end of 2016 at current run rates, there's obviously going to be a step down in the share count. I just want to make sure I get that right. Thanks.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll \u2013 Kulbinder, this is Gino. On the margin question, our expectation for margin in Q3 and in Q4 is in line with what we've seen in prior, certainly last year and in prior periods.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I think on seasonality, I believe that our expectations on the second half of this year are generally comparable with last year.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","On the tender, as Gino mentioned earlier, we'll see how it shakes out. And after the tender closes out, there will be the opportunity for us to enter into, after the tender is completed in an open market capacity as we evaluate that accordingly.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","But just to be clear, Greg, on that point, you remain committed to ongoing share repurchases, in a sense, thanks to free cash flow being distributed beyond this as well, right?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. No change to the capital allocation framework that we outlined.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. Thanks, guys. Good quarter. Hey, Gino, real quick, you'd mentioned that after the tender is over, you're going to have to take a timeout according to the rules. How long is that going to be in effect for?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's 10 business days, Keith.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Oh, just 10 days. Easy enough. Good. And then if you can just drill down a little bit deeper into the North American business, up 6%. It's another good quarter for you guys there. Can you provide a little bit more color on where that strength is coming from? Is it the PCR business? Is it the federal business? Just a little more color there, please.","Mark Moon - Executive Vice President and President, Sales & Marketing","Hey, Keith. This is Mark. Actually the strength has been across the board. As we'd mentioned earlier, we've been getting strength in the systems business as well as the device business. The PCR business last quarter was relatively flat, but it had been growing prior to that. And again, if you think about overall North America, growth has been 4%, 6% and 5% the last three quarters, so a little stronger than what \u2013 or it's certainly at the high end of our expectations.","The federal business has also grown the last two quarters. And we expect it to grow again in the second half and to have modest growth again for the full year. So don't want to declare victory yet, but as we said, we thought that the narrow-banding effect had worn off and it looks like North America, even given when we talk about North America, they're facing some FX headwinds of about $20 million in Canada, but across the board, seems to be good growth and solid, if you will, pipeline to where we're looking at the future.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Genovese with MKM Partners. Your line is now open.","Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC","Great. Thanks a lot for taking the question. First, on the Silver Lake investment, I'm just trying to understand what additional business opportunities or end markets or product areas will this investment allow you to target? I'm just \u2013 I'm confused about these new business opportunities, what they are.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think, Michael, I don't think they're new business opportunities. I think the Silver Lake deal is more about bringing additional capacity for us to go achieve them and go seize them. As somebody mentioned earlier, this is exactly consistent with \u2013 we outlined in our Financial Analyst Day in February. So this is all about doubling down on software and services, more specifically Smart Public Safety Software and our Services business. I don't think it's new. I think it's a reaffirmation of our commitment and an acceleration therein.","Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC","Great. That's helpful. And then the second point is that with this $2 billion tender offer, it's obviously going to reduce the share count above and beyond what we already thought, but yet we're getting the EPS guidance that's consistent with before. It doesn't seem to take the reduction in the share count into \u2013 I mean how is that taken into account in your guide?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In the guidance \u2013 so it's important to note and, as I said earlier, the $2.5 billion in what we've guided to for the year and now it's $3.5 billion, but it's also important to note that from an accounting perspective, the Silver Lake investment, the shares represented in that investment will also be included in EPS.","Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC","Right. Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the clarifications. Thanks.","Operator","I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks.","Shep Dunlap - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Yocum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Tim Yocum","Good afternoon. Welcome to our 2019 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President and CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President of Products and Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President, Services and Software. Greg and Gino will review our results, along with commentary and Jack and Kelly will join for Q&A.","We have posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com\/investor.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I will turn it over to Greg.","Greg Brown","Thanks, Tim. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I will start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook.","So first, Q3 was another strong quarter. We grew revenue 7%, expanded operating margins by 120 basis points and generated $525 million of operating cash flow, an increase of 55% versus the prior year. Additionally, we ended the quarter with our highest backlog position ever of $11 billion, up $1.6 billion year-over-year and up $160 million sequentially. Second, we continue to execute well across all platforms. Our land mobile radio business is on pace for another record year of sales and earnings led by North America. Our video security business had another strong quarter of revenue growth and is gaining traction with government customers and our command center software business is continuing to drive revenue growth and margin expansion in our Software and Services segment. And finally, based on our Q3 results and our expectations for another solid performance in Q4, we are once again raising our earnings per share estimates for the full year 2019.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 results and outlook before returning just for some very brief closing thoughts.","Gino Bonanotte","Thank you, Greg. Q3 includes revenue of $2 billion, up 7% versus last year, including $58 million of revenue from acquisitions and currency headwinds of $21 million. Organic revenue growth was 4%. GAAP operating earnings of $413 million, up $119 million and operating margins of 20.7% of sales compared to 15.8% in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating earnings of $509 million, up $57 million or 13% and non-GAAP operating margins of 25.5% of sales, up 120 basis points driven by higher sales in gross margins partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions. GAAP earnings per share of $1.51 compared to $1.43 in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.04, up 5% from $1.94 last year on higher operating earnings offset primarily by a higher effective tax rate. OpEx in Q3 was $504 million, up $40 million versus last year primarily due to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $39 million compared to $43 million in the year ago quarter driven primarily by a decrease in net interest expense. The Q3 effective tax rate was 23% compared to 18% in the prior year. The year-over-year increase was driven by the recognition of a favorable return to provision adjustment in the prior year.","Turning to cash flow, Q3 operating cash flow was $525 million compared to $338 million in the prior year and free cash flow was $465 million compared with $292 million in the prior year. The higher cash flow was primarily due to improved working capital, a settlement payment in the prior year related to a legacy business and higher earnings. Capital allocation for Q3 included $271 million in cash and equity for the acquisition of WatchGuard, $94 million in cash dividends, $60 million of CapEx and we paid off the $400 million term loan used to acquire Avigilon. Additionally, we agreed to extend our strategic partnership with Silver Lake. As part of the agreement, Silver Lake agreed to make a new $1 billion investment in Motorola Solutions and settled the outstanding $800 million aggregate principal investment 1 year ahead of its maturity. The $800 million principal was settled in cash and the premium was settled with $300 million in cash and $5.5 million in shares. The transaction resulted in an overall reduction to our diluted share count in the quarter.","Moving to segment results, Q3 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.3 billion, up $61 million or 5% driven by the Americas. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $27 million and currency headwinds were $9 million. Operating earnings were $300 million or 22.2% of sales, up 80 basis points from last year on higher sales and gross margins partially offset by higher OpEx from acquisitions. Some notable Q3 wins in the segment include an award from Bell Mobility for the largest Canadian P25 contract in history serving the province of Ontario, $27 million in video security wins in education, a $16 million P25 order from Lee County, Florida, several large awards in mobile and in-car video, including $13 million for the City of Nashville, Tennessee, and $4 million for the Michigan state police and $3 million in fixed video security wins for government customers.","Moving to the Services and Software segment, revenue was $645 million, up $71 million or 12% from last year driven by growth in the Americas and EMEA. Revenue from acquisitions in the quarter was $31 million and currency headwinds were $12 million. Operating earnings were $209 million or 32.4% of sales, up 170 basis points from last year driven by higher sales and gross margin expansion. Notable Q3 wins in the segment include a $78 million dollar P25 multiyear service contract with the state of Michigan extending service through 2029, a $58 million P25 multiyear statewide service contract in North America, and $11 million Command Center Software Suite contract with Glendale, Arizona and a $4 million contract for a 911 system in Bogota, Colombia.","Looking at regional results, America\u2019s Q3 revenue was $1.5 billion, up 12% driven by broad-based growth across all platforms. EMEA Q3 revenue was $384 million, down 1% due to large system deployments in the Middle East in the prior year and currency headwinds partially offset by growth in Europe. And in Asia-Pacific, Q3 revenue was $158 million, down 9% or $16 million due to China and currency headwinds. Ending backlog was $11 billion, up $1.6 billion or 17% compared to last year. Sequentially, backlog was up $160 million with growth in both segments. Services and software backlog was up $1.6 billion or 26% compared to last year. Approximately half of the increase was driven by the Americas and half by EMEA. The EMEA growth is primarily related to the ESN and Airwave extensions. Sequentially, backlog was up $34 million due to multiyear contracts in the Americas partially offset by revenue recognition for ESN and Airwave. Products and SI segment backlog was down $39 million or 1% compared to last year, due to two large system deployments during the prior year in the Middle East and Africa partially offset by growth of $134 million in the Americas. Sequentially, backlog was up $126 million driven by the Americas.","Turning to our outlook, we expect Q4 sales to be up 5% to 5.5% with non-GAAP EPS between $2.75 and $2.80. This assumes $20 million of FX headwinds at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately $176 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. For the full year 2019, we now expect revenue growth of 7.25% to 7.5% and we now expect non-GAAP EPS between $7.77 and $7.82, up from our prior guidance of $7.67 to $7.77. This full year outlook assumes $115 million of FX headwinds at current rates, an effective tax rate of 23.5% and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 176 million shares. We continue to expect full-year operating cash flow to be approximately $1.7 billion.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Greg.","Greg Brown","Thank you, Gino. First, I am very pleased with our Q3 results. It was another quarter of solid organic revenue growth, significant expansion of both gross margins and operating margins. Strong operating cash flow generation of over $0.5 billion and we finished with our highest quarter ending backlog position ever. We also closed the acquisition of WatchGuard, a leader in the in-car and body-worn video. Second, 2019 is looking to be another strong year of growth led by North America, our LMR business is positioned for a second consecutive year of record sales and our command center software and video security businesses continue to perform very well. Given our year-to-date performance and ending backlog, we are positioned for another year of record revenue earnings and cash flow.","And finally, this week at the International Association of Chiefs of Police here in Chicago, we had product introductions that spanned our entire mission critical portfolio including our next-generation LMR Radio APX NEXT, which is broadband enabled for mobile apps designed specifically for first responders. And what struck me the most as they walked our booth, was how the investments in our portfolio have come together, not as point products or separate acquisitions, but as a fully interconnected ecosystem, where mission-critical communications, video security and analytics, command center software and services are operating seamlessly together. And it\u2019s the power of these integrated mission critical solutions that has me excited when I think about our future going forward.","So now I will turn it back over to Tim and open it up for your questions.","Tim Yocum","Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I would like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Tim Long","Thank you. Maybe just two I will give you together if I can. First on the video side, guys, it sounds like last quarter you were starting to see some traction in the education vertical, I see \u2013 do you know you went over a number of video wins kind of across different platforms in the quarter? Could you just talk a little bit about growth there in particularly with the new ban and the NDAA in effect, what are you thinking about growth for that business? And then secondly on the call center software side, it seems like there has been good traction, could you talk a little bit about the trajectory of maybe getting into more piece apps and maybe selling multiple solutions to the ones that you are currently in and how do we think about that adding to the growth for the company? Thank you.","Jack Molloy","Hey, Tim, good evening, it\u2019s Jack. I will take the first question related to video. So as we have discussed before, we expect the video business to grow 15% this year. I will tell you, Q3, the performance exceeded our expectations. Specific to education, we had $27 million in orders in Q3. And if you remember Q2 is typically the high points, so we\u2019re really pleased with $27 million. We got $1 million order from the University of South Carolina. We had not done a lot in higher ed, so again please there. And then I think the last thing is the Federal Bureau of Prisons, we talked about a year kind of a year to take place for the federal government success and that was well in advance of what we expected and think of that as a platform that will build on. I think all these things are empowered by two things. We made pretty significant go-to-market investments in North America, but probably more importantly, we announced the H5 camera line and the Avigilon Control Center, which are software and analytics package 7.0, focus of attention, unusual speed detection, things like that. So a lot of excitement in the market and I think you will continue to see our momentum from there and turn it over in the second half.","Kelly Mark","Tim, it\u2019s Kelly. On the software part, I will address that. First I will just say, we look at the business, we are very pleased with that. Our orders, our revenue and our backlog growth are all exceeding the market growth rate. The team has done a great job showing the benefits of the suite and the customers are definitely recognizing it. Year-to-date as we think about it, you probably referenced in the past, percent of our orders in the command center that our suite related where we have sold two or more components of our software together or where we have added on to already existing pieces of software and added to that. As we look at year-to-date, we are just over 25%, which is an improvement from what we\u2019ve seen in the past. It\u2019s great to see some notable customer wins, you probably saw us reference a particularly large win with Glendale, Arizona, where they bought a pretty much the entire suite, CAD, records, jail, mobility our vast solution as well and integrated those together and also customers like we see in Latin America with the Bogota in Colombia, where we added on a 911 software system in addition to what they already have in regards to CAD and records that they have. So we are seeing good traction across the board on suites and I am pleased with the progress we are seeing also in the development of what Andrew and team were doing there.","Tim Long","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","The next question is from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Adam Tindle","Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. I want to start by obviously acknowledging a lot of positive to highlight here in the quarter. But Greg, I am going to be brave here and try to paint a narrative that I know has holes in it, but just get it out there, because I know you won\u2019t be shy to respond. You recently announced the new APX NEXT devices that incorporate broadband capability, FirstNet Interoperability and didn\u2019t think there was you were seeing much of the use case for broadband and mission-critical radios and I know that LMR has been doing well, but product backlog is down year-over-year for the second quarter, now. I know Americas is up, but video is doing well and some additional inorganic contribution. So some thought that this is an indication that perhaps broadband and FirstNet is starting to and going to continue to have an impact on the core LMR business, I think you understand the narrative that\u2019s painted there, so just want to give you an opportunity to respond to that?","Greg Brown","Yes, Adam. Thanks for the question. I don\u2019t think the introduction of APX NEXT has anything to do with a narrative that would suggest LTE or specifically FirstNet taking a more prominent role, but specifically cannibalizing LMR. As you know, Adam, we haven\u2019t seen that in the past. We still don\u2019t see that now. Backlog is up, you know that year-on-year and sequentially. By the way, it\u2019s also worth noting that the backlog is up, despite some significant FX headwinds that we didn\u2019t articulate. But with what Molloy\u2019s team is doing on LMR and the introduction of APX NEXT, which we\u2019re excited about and maybe Jack could say a few words about the feature set. Software connect and seamless roaming between LMR and LTE actually we believe extends LMR. It\u2019s not an encroachment of LTE. It makes LMR, it makes APX NEXT. It makes private networks even more compelling, and I think that\u2019s represented by the statewide upgrades that we had this year that were almost 2x the volume of previous periods. But I just don\u2019t see it that way and I think FirstNet is complementary to LMR, just like in the UK, ESN is complementary to Airwave, but I just don\u2019t see any cannibalization or chilling effect. By the way, just, since we\u2019re talking about FirstNet, as you know, I think, Adam, it has a de minimis impact of revenue for this year. We would see equally minimal revenue contribution from next year.","Jack Molloy","Yes, maybe just to piggyback on top of that, I think this is an important point. As a service or the recurring revenue component of APX NEXT, will actually be contracted through the customer directly to Motorola. And that will be three different things. It will be, obviously, Greg talked a little bit about the SmartConnect, the ability to extend LMR capabilities, for instance if it was somewhat from the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office that was at a conference in Miami. They have capability to connect back to the network, but two of the the other really important features are called SmartLocate, which essentially provides paying to every \u2013 depending on the situation every 3 seconds to 15 seconds, location device of an Officer critical for Officer safety, but maybe the most important and underrated thing is a feature called Smart Programing, which will essentially take what used to take weeks or months to program radios and essentially provide an out-of-the-box experience. So really what we\u2019re doing is to Greg\u2019s point, extending the LMR P25 network, but leveraging some of the broadband technology to do complementary technologies. The other thing to hit on is the APX NEXT is actually a premium device. So if we think about the APX family that is, quite candidly been the most successful product in the history of this Company. This will be kind of the Cadillac, if you will, or the premium tier and we should think of that is kind of taken three to five years historically. We have a new fleet three to five years to start making \u2013 when we start to see the sales pivot to APX NEXT and the next gen of those. So hopefully that answers your question.","Adam Tindle","Yes, very helpful. And it sounds like there is some potentially attractive economic models that could be associated with it as well. Maybe just as a quick follow-up Gino, product and SI operating margins look like, if I am backing into the 2019 guidance correctly, maybe toward the low end of the 22% to 23% range for 2019, and hoping that maybe just double click on that because I know it\u2019s perhaps not exactly like-to-like, but products gross margin and gross profit are up healthily, and operating margin and operating profit are lagging that growth a little bit. I know you have a number of acquisitions weighing, probably some opportunity there. So maybe just some color how we can think about operating leverage in that segment moving forward? Thank you.","Gino Bonanotte","Sure. Adam, yes the guidance suggests the lower end of that 22% to 23% range. It\u2019s important to note that gross margin is above, slightly above our expectation for the full year. So really the impact is opex related to the acquisition and frankly related to some legal expense related with the Hytera IP lawsuit ongoing this year. So those are the two issues. I\u2019m very pleased with the gross margin, it\u2019s opex will get after the acquisitions and again legal expense until that trial is resolved or that action is resolved. We\u2019ll continue to include that in our guidance. We\u2019re very pleased with the performance \u2013 gross margin performance.","Adam Tindle","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","George Notter","Hi, thanks a lot guys. I guess I wanted to kind of drive toward inorganic growth rate for backlog. You mentioned there was an FX impact there. I know it\u2019s pretty substantial last quarter, but I\u2019d be curious on what that number actually was? And then WatchGuard, I would imagine also maybe gave you a bit of backlog benefit there. Also, I was wondering what kind of contribution that might have had? And then I assume the two Middle East deals from a year ago are not backlog affecting as I look at year-on-year compares?","Gino Bonanotte","Yes, that\u2019s correct. So there are a couple of things there to unpack the \u2013 the FX adjustment that Greg mentioned was $115 million sequential, unfavorable FX adjustment. Getting back to your question on the organic growth rate of backlog, so that was the extent of the adjustment. The second question?","Greg Brown","Was a WatchGuard question?","Gino Bonanotte","Yes. And that\u2019s really minimal backlog George. It\u2019s kind of a run-rate business with very little backlog, so not much of an impact at all to our backlog.","George Notter","Got it. And then I\u2019m sorry, the year on \u2013 can you just tell me the FX impact on a year-on-year basis","Gino Bonanotte","Its $200 million, George.","George Notter","Okay. So backlog organically, I think grew nicely over 10% year-on-year, is that roughly ballpark?","Gino Bonanotte","Yes.","George Notter","Great. Okay, super. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Keith Housum","Good afternoon, guys. Hey, just want to explore a little bit the difference in the growth rates between Europe and North America. I would see North America is on fire now for the past two years or so, if not a little longer. Is the difference in the growth rates more macroeconomic driven or is it more based on the portfolio you have there? And then perhaps you guys touch on the growth or the opportunity with the video segment now with Avigilon and WatchGuard and what your opportunity is outside of the US?","Jack Molloy","Okay, Keith. So I think the question was really around EMEA versus North America. Yes. North America, just from a scale \u2013 go-to-market scale points of presence, it\u2019s obviously our strongest market, it\u2019s up \u2013 Q3 was up 7% in terms of constant currency and I think as Greg articulated in the open its strength across the board. It\u2019s strength in our LMR business, strength in the command center software business and our services business and obviously we had a very good quarter in our video business. EMEA is actually for \u2013 in the third quarter, we\u2019re actually up 2% inorganic constant currency. So some of the things we felt are obviously the headwinds \u2013 we\u2019ve had some FX headwinds there, but it was just in Europe, two weeks ago at our partner conference, and there are some challenges in certain countries. But I would dimensionalize Europe is still relatively steady state, where we\u2019re seeing the most pressure internationally is actually in Asia-Pac and to kind of put that into context, it\u2019s 8% of our overall revenue. So not very material, but at the same time we\u2019re seeing macro \u2013 we\u2019re seeing some macro level issues. China is very small in terms of what it means from a revenue component of our country, but within the region, we\u2019re seeing some contingents that have actually slowed some things down in certain areas. I\u2019d also offer that when I look at the APAC business, a lot of this is on us and meaning it\u2019s on me and and our team in terms of ability to understand the process a little bit better, where we might have some macro level issues, because budget issues, we\u2019ve got to see through those and we\u2019ve got to execute better as well. But as it applies to Europe, it\u2019s not as strong as North America, obviously, but it\u2019s fairly steady. APAC is really where we\u2019ve seen the primary weakness as the years rolled out.","Keith Housum","Great. And just kind of expanding on that question, can you just touch on your opportunities with Avigilon and WatchGuard outside of the U.S. and is that a factor helping to drive some of the growth in the U.S. comparatives the EMEA?","Jack Molloy","Yes. So I think we have \u2013 in two different things. In Avigilon, we have opportunity in terms of \u2013 we\u2019ve got to increase the number of routes to market internationally, that\u2019s in Latin America, that\u2019s in Asia Pacific and that\u2019s in Europe. The work is being done there to really get the product on more shelves. They were \u2013 when we acquired Avigilon, they were relatively \u2013 their focus was rightfully so in North America. And we\u2019ve got to bring more scale to then both with our sales force and our distribution partners. That\u2019s the first thing. Secondarily, WatchGuard has also been relatively a North America phenomenon. We actually picked up a body worn camera through the Vigilant acquisition, a company based out, who had acquired a company based out of Scotland that actually has a very nice solution internationally at a better price point. So we\u2019re going to look at both of those options to take the body worn camera in international, but WatchGuard is really a North America Solution as it stands today.","Keith Housum","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Ben Bollin","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit about the public sector sales process within command center and surveillance, specifically I\u2019d be interested in your thoughts on the average duration of the process? Any generalities for how relative deal sizes would compare, like traditional LMR deal to the same type of customer? And any high level thoughts you have on the overall competitive landscape right now based on some of the preliminary stuff that you guys are doing?","Jack Molloy","Absolutely, Ben. I will start this is Jack and I think the first part of it is a selling process. And I\u2019m going to \u2013 Kelly is going to jump in to provide some color. The selling process in terms of the command center software is actually a fairly lengthy cycle, meaning it\u2019s typically anywhere from minimal a year to two years. There is a high level because it\u2019s a 24\/7, a highly intense environment and you\u2019ve got a customer base, meaning dispatchers in our high stress environment. There\u2019s a lot of demonstrability and particularly as they navigate software changes, there is a lot of features that may be were legacy features that we have to kind of deal with because it certainly affects their operating procedures in the command center. So they\u2019re typically long, and I think a credit to the inorganic and organic activity that Kelly and Andrew and team have done, frankly the deal sizes are getting larger. And I think as Kelly articulated, we\u2019ve grown the level of suite services \u2013 the suite sales, which have contributed to that. Kelly, I think you want to \u2013 anything you want to add to that?","Kelly Mark","Yes, just on the competitive component. You know, look, if you look at the external view across any number of market studies out there, referenced as market growing around a high single-digit growth rate and as we referenced in the past and it has continued to play out, our software business is growing in double digits. So we\u2019re very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing in regards to the growth of the business. I\u2019d also add competitively. I think as you probably saw at IACP, we\u2019ve made a number of announcements around some additional components of our software \u2013 command center software portfolio. I\u2019m very happy about what we\u2019re doing. Also, one thing I\u2019d highlight is the records portfolio and what we\u2019re doing there. As we all know, in the command center, one of the biggest things that they deal with is just the inundation of data, pictures, video, voice that they have to handle in that records platform that we announced. It\u2019s something that our customers are very excited about because it provides to have an opportunity with one records platform to be able to manage data that comes in from any variety of sources. So it\u2019s not just managing body-worn video or 911 calls, it\u2019s being able to compose all the data that comes into the command center and be able to manage it. So competitively we view that as something that is really unique part of our software portfolio that no one else can emulate. So very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing there and the customer receptivity and the feedback we\u2019re getting from them has been really great and it shows in the results.","Ben Bollin","And as a follow-up, looking at the broader business, you talked about some of the uncertainty, maybe some more macro in APAC. Do you have any thoughts on a broader macro perspective? As it relates to commercial LMR and then will not upgrade Greg any update to the broader 2021 framework discussion you\u2019ve provided previously? Thanks guys.","Greg Brown","So there is no updates to the broader 2021, approximately 9 and 10. Remember, it wasn\u2019t guidance, it wasn\u2019t prescriptive it was directional. My phrases up into the right and it contemplates both operating the business and continued inorganic activity. From a 2020 standpoint, we\u2019re not going to guide the specifics as you would expect that will be reserved for our February call. But as I sit here today, kind of high level top-line revenue growth, I think about roughly 4%, which is consistent with what we said this year. Consistent with what we said last year and again overall from a drivers standpoint across all three platforms, LMR and video security and command center software, I feel pretty good about it. By the way, just one other dimensionalize it\u2019s worth mentioning, it may seem a little tactical, but worth reminding. As you all think about 2020, remember Q1 specifically is always our lightest quarter. Q1 of this year was a record quarter that included $40 million of federal revenue in Q1 of \u201819 that we do not expect to repeat in Q1 of 2020. So high level dimensionalize events continued solid growth, obviously a solid backlog position, no change to the 9 and 10 in 2021 and I think the Jack and Kelly and the team and quite frankly, all the people at Motorola continue to do a great job and I appreciate their efforts.","Ben Bollin","Thank you.","Greg Brown","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Paul Silverstein","Before I ask questions, I just want to clarify in your response to the previous question, Greg. I thought at one hand end you were giving guidance on the other hand, I think I heard you say 4% revenue growth for next year. Was that the 4% that you cited was that specific to 2020, but...","Greg Brown","Yes, what I\u2019m not being prescriptive on that specifically on EPS in operating cash and others, but it\u2019s just meant to signal more or less to Ben\u2019s question our view on our expectation of continued growth. We do expect growth. We do expect organic constant currency growth. We do expect cash flow growth. But just to give you an anchor point and a reference point. Yes, as I sit here today, the kind of view of top line was about 4%, very consistent with this year and what we said this year and what we said last year.","Paul Silverstein","I appreciate that. I might have two questions. One is a broad question, I apologize, visiting a number of questions earlier in the call. And then a specific question, the broad question is to the extent that video hardware analytics and monitoring along with margins have been the two or I think certainly are two of the key upside opportunities and focuses for the Company. Can you give us any sense of the opportunities from here over the course of the next year in terms of how much more you can do in driving margin upside as well as of WatchGuard and Avigilon in terms of how far how fast that revenue can grow? I recognize you address the things you need to do in terms of outside of the U.S. and their go-to-market etc., but any quantification you could provide? And then the specific question would be, you just referenced U.S. federal passing, a number of companies this quarter cited very strong U.S. federal revenue in the fiscal year-end. Can you characterize what you\u2019re seeing out of U.S. federal?","Greg Brown","Why doesn\u2019t Jack take U.S. federal first?","Jack Molloy","Yes, so U.S. federal, we\u2019ve \u2013 it was not only \u2013 we talked about the strength of the North America business and you wouldn\u2019t have a good Q3 without a very strong federal quarter, but I would also offer, it\u2019s been Mark McNulty and federal team has had a very good year in 2019. It\u2019s everything from devices to systems to services and it really spans a continuum of law enforcement agencies in the Fed\u2019s civil agencies as well as our Defense bases in the Communication Systems we supply to them. So proud of what the team accomplished in Q3, but really, we have had a very solid 2019.","Greg Brown","And Paul just overall, on your question of kind of the overall business, we do expect cash flow and operating margin expansion to continue against the specifics coming on the February call. I think that\u2019s largely going to come out of software and services. I think Kelly and Andrew and his entire team have done a great job on platforming the business, getting efficiencies of the business, integrating the suite. The percentage of suite purchases and orders is slightly incrementally higher than what Kelly referenced earlier. We talked about an operating margin in that segment, software and services on the last call of 30% to 31%, that\u2019s going to look like, more like 31% for full year \u201819. Do we expect that can improve in 2020? We do? And Kelly and Andrew will provide me and all of us with the specifics on 2020, but also what I would say is the areas that we\u2019re playing in. Video security, where we\u2019ve targeted to grow 3x the market, all in 15% versus 5% and as Jack referenced in Q3 we were strong in Q3, and we still believe will grow at 15% for 2019 and that continues. On command center software, it\u2019s performing in the high teens and again for now we expect that to continue. So \u2013 and that\u2019s against the backdrop of an addressable market of all of these businesses land, mobile, radio, video security and analytics and command center software of an addressable market we size that about $39 billion for 2020. So I think there is room to run. I think Molloy and Kaczynski are executing very well with the Avigilon acquisition and the other video assets. That is we aggregate and go to market in an integrated way, we\u2019ll continue that performance and I think command center software and services, which we don\u2019t talk as much about though that too is continuing to run very well. So there is opportunity. There is a sizable addressable market, you know the numbers that we\u2019re growing and command center software and video security, I think land mobile radio including SI and services all in will continue to move forward. By the way, we will also consciously move more and more land, mobile, radio product to land, mobile, radio infrastructure as a service which will improve stickiness, improve annuity revenue in that segment and overall solidify the profile of our position competitively. So, I feel good about where we are and how we\u2019re executing. There is always a lot more work to do, but this is a solid quarter, it\u2019s going to be, it should be, we expect it to be a record year in \u201819. And then we\u2019ll update you on all the specifics with those metrics in 2020.","Paul Silverstein","I appreciate the response. Thanks Greg.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Yoon with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Yoon","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the prior answer you had for a baseline of 4% revenue growth in 2020. Can you talk about the levers there? So what do you think could drive better than expected, top-line? Is it an uptick in video security adoption or new product intro and is there anything we should be aware of that could pressure revenue growth from that baseline?","Greg Brown","I think, look at this point, I think it\u2019s just a prudent way to plan the business as we look at 2020. Molloy, talked about \u2013 North America has been great and the execution across pretty much all platforms. He talked about a little bit of international, more specifically Asia-Pac, where we see budgets being pushed out. I don\u2019t think its deals lost. Now Asia-Pac is 8% of our overall revenue in \u201819 and as you know, China is now about 1.5% of revenue for us. So it\u2019s not significant. The issue though is, as the China economy slows down, does it have a contagion effect in some other adjacent or neighboring theaters in the region. It may, but also as Jack said we on the execution side can do a better job in terms of forecasting specificity and understanding budget cycles and what\u2019s available. So I think it really is just the best way in the prudent way we think to plan the business, video security in Q3 was stronger than our expectations. So are there areas that we could perform stronger against that view of course, there are potentially there are, but at this point, we think this is the right way to think about it, dimensionalize it again as I sit here today.","Brian Yoon","Okay, great. Thank you.","Greg Brown","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Sami Badri","Hi, thank you. The first question has to do with products, just SI, and I want to understand beyond the big lumpy deals. The way you generate some of those revenues, could you give us any idea on the type of radios that were sold? Are these higher mix? Are you starting to see the installed base refresh their products? If there is a cycle where are we in that cycle or are some of the growth being driven by Avigilon products on the hardware side, can you just unpack this a little bit more for us, so we can go through it?","Jack Molloy","I\u2019ll \u2013 hey Sami, it\u2019s Jack. Two things, so for the third quarter, what we\u2019ve seen from Products and SI, it\u2019s both. Actually to your point, Avigilon, albeit Avigilon had a very good quarter so we\u2019re going to see some of that. As we think about the LMR products that are in there, we had, we had strength really frankly in devices. So that\u2019s APX devices, the APX family of which we just announced, kind of the next generation or the APX NEXT. And that strengthened the U.S. government, U.S. public safety state and local, as well as the federal government, which I just articulated had a very good quarter. Gino, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like\u2026.","Gino Bonanotte","Yes, I think \u2013 I think you answered your Jack. it\u2019s really on the product side, strength across the board in Q3, there wasn\u2019t one area that was exceptional. No large deal in there that drove the results, it was broad-based, actually across all platforms, but across all the product segment.","Jack Molloy","The commercial \u2013 the commercial business was actually up 3% in North America in Q3 as well, so just like a \u2013 just pretty much strength across the board.","Sami Badri","Got it. Thank you. And then just a follow-up question regarding Avigilon and some of the more software\/artificial intelligence related capabilities that the software actually has, where are we in the integration cycle for specifically those capabilities into the broader command center suite?","Kelly Mark","Sami, I\u2019ll take that. In regards to Avigilon, one of the things that we\u2019ve done, we\u2019re very pleased about is, we\u2019ve immediately taken the Avigilon portfolio and to the extent our public safety customers are using Avigilon, we have already integrated into our command center suite. So, one of the products, which you probably saw us announce earlier in the year is CommandCentral Aware. The CommandCentral Aware is a product which helps gives our customers a consolidated view in the command center of a situation including location of officers, information related to the 911 call, any inputs around license plates and in addition to that, to the extent they access Avigilon cameras, they can have that feed into the command center. So it\u2019s not just Avigilon, we work with a lot of other video suppliers out there because it\u2019s important as being in the command center, that being kind of the central point where situations are controlled that we can interface to others. But of course interfacing to Avigilon is something that we incorporated earlier this year. It\u2019s just one of the examples of the integration components that we provided through the command center.","Sami Badri","Great. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tim Yocum for any closing remarks.","Tim Yocum","Thanks for joining guys and we look forward to talking to most of you soon. Take care.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","The presentation material and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Motorola Solutions Investor Relations website. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 3 hours after the conclusion of this call over the Internet. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com\/investor. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Dunlap, you may begin.","Shep Dunlap","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss third quarter results. With me this morning are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Ed Fitzpatrick, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mark Moon, Executive Vice President, Sales and Field Operations. Greg and Ed will review our third quarter results along with commentary, and Mark will join us for Q&A.","We have posted our earnings presentation and press release at motorolasolutions.com\/investor. These materials do include a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for your reference. It's important that you review these items.","A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation.

Brown","Thanks, Shep. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was another excellent quarter for Motorola Solutions as we delivered consistent revenue growth, strong earnings per share growth, expanded operating margins and continued to return capital to shareholders.","This morning, we reported third quarter sales of $2.2 billion, a 3% increase over Q3 of last year. On a GAAP basis, net earnings were $0.72 per share from continuing operations, compared to $0.45 per share in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations were $0.84 per share compared to $0.66 per share in the third quarter of last year, which represents a 27% increase.","For the remainder of this call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise noted.","Our Government segment revenues increased 12%, a record third quarter. This reflects growth across the segment driven by a combination of factors including core market growth, new product introductions, international expansion and narrowbanding in the U.S.","Operating margins in Government improved 390 basis points year-over-year to 20.4% due to the strong top line growth, favorable sales mix and continued operating leverage as we continue to manage costs.","In our Enterprise segment, sales declined 13% from the year ago quarter including a $29 million decrease in iDEN. This segment continues to face headwinds, largely driven by the macroeconomic environment, fewer larger deals and anticipated foreign currency pressure. That said, we remain confident in our portfolio and excited about our new product introductions going forward.","I'll now turn it over to Ed to discuss our financial results in more detail. I'll then return to discuss operational highlights and provide additional commentary and perspective on our business performance.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Thanks, Greg. Q3 was another strong quarter. Revenue growth was 3%, consistent with our total company outlook with Government stronger, Enterprise weaker than we anticipated. Given the difficult compare from the year ago quarter, we are pleased with our top line performance. This growth came despite anticipated foreign currency headwinds of $42 million or approximately 2 percentage points.","We saw another quarter of broad-based revenue growth in our Government segment with record third quarter sales of $1.5 billion, an increase of nearly 12% from the prior year. Operating margins in the Government segment improved 390 basis points from 16.5% to 20.4%. Strong sales, favorable mix and continued cost efficiency drove this improvement.","Enterprise sales declined 13% to $632 million. Operating margin in the Enterprise segment declined to 12.2%, driven in part by sales mix and foreign currency headwinds. However, the largest driver was the sales decline as underlying expenses remained relatively flat on a year-over-year basis.","Turning to earnings. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.84 per share compared to $0.66 per share a year ago, a 27% increase, driven by improved operating performance and share repurchases. Operating expenses were $709 million or 32.9% of revenue, which represents an 80 basis point improvement from the year ago quarter.","Overall, I'm pleased with our operating leverage improvement. Operating earnings for the third quarter were $387 million or 18% of sales compared to $359 million or 17.2% in Q3 of 2011.","Going forward, we will continue to reinvest in our business and expect to generate returns well in excess of our cost of capital while also improving R&D and SG&A as a percentage of revenue.","Total other income and expense was a net expense of $13 million in the quarter compared to a net expense of $16 million in Q3 2011. This line item was lower, primarily due to gains on investments during the quarter. Going forward, we expect this line item to be a net expense of approximately $20 million to $25 million consistent with our view last quarter.","Our effective tax rate was 35.6% for the quarter. For the full year 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to be 34% to 35%. We still expect a cash tax rate of approximately 20% for this year, and we expect the tax cash rate to average 20% over the next several years as we utilize available tax credits.","Cash flow from operations was $182 million during the quarter, which included the impact of a $72 million pension contribution made in late Q3 rather than early Q4 to reduce pension-related PBGC fees in 2013. Our year-to-date 2012 contributions to the pension plan were $340 million, which satisfies the full year planned funding. This represents an incremental $170 million of year-to-date contributions in comparison to last year when we had contributed $170 million through the first 3 quarters.","Let me spend a moment on the increase in working capital. There were 2 main contributors to this increase; first, earning inventory balance increased sequentially, which was approximately $20 million higher than expected due to softer enterprise demand; and second, our receivables balance was approximately $100 million higher sequentially. This increase was due primarily to linearity in shipments as well as linearity in billings, which were more back-end loaded in part due to our Q3 ERP conversion. Having said that, it's important to note that there was no meaningful deterioration in our cash receivable aging during the quarter. We remain very focused on working capital management. As you know, this is a long-cycle business with significant milestone billings that can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We remain confident that we will deliver approximately $1 billion in cash flow from operations for full year 2012 consistent with our previous outlook.","We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash and investments and approximately $1.9 billion in debt. We purchased $308 million in stock during the quarter at an average price of $47.47. This brings us to over $3.2 billion in share repurchases, which is over 70 million shares at an average price of $45.95 since July of last year. In addition, we paid $63 million in dividends in the quarter.","Year-to-date, we have returned over $2.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.","Now turning to our Q4 and full year outlook. For Q4, we expect sales growth of approximately 6% to 7% over the fourth quarter of 2011. Our outlook is for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.03 from continuing operations based on our Q3 ending share count. This compares to non-GAAP EPS in Q4 of 2011 of $0.87 per share. Consistent with prior quarters, this outlook excludes stock-based compensation and intangible amortization expense of approximately $0.13 per share and items historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings releases.","We are increasing our full year sales outlook to 6% to 6.5% to reflect the recently completed Psion transaction with approximately $60 million in revenue in Q4. This transaction is expected to negatively impact Q4 EPS by $0.02 per share, which includes transaction-related fees and purchase accounting adjustments and is reflected in the guidance for the quarter.","I'll now turn it back over to Greg for business highlights from the quarter.","Gregory Q. Brown","Ed, thanks. In our Government sales -- segment, sales for the quarter were $1.5 billion, a 12% increase of Q3 2011. We saw growth across the entire product portfolio and in North America, Latin America and EMEA. Profitability also improved significantly with operating earnings growing to 20.4% of sales compared to 16.5% in Q3 last year.","We saw double-digit growth in both systems and radio devices. Safety and security remains a priority among governments and funding for mission-critical systems continues to reflect this priority. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in our Government segment, which demonstrates the priority that mission-critical communications receives in various budget conditions.","State and local governments continue to face budget choices, but according to a recent National League of City survey, a majority of financial officers believe their cities are better able to meet fiscal needs and nearly half reported increased expenditures on public safety. Many of the existing public safety systems have been in use for decades and will need to be replaced with next-generation digital systems. However, these transitions will take place over years and on the time lines our individual customers want rather than forced migrations. This underscores the importance of our solutions, which are backwards-compatible and forward-migratable.","Customers choosing to invest in new digital systems get enhanced features such as voice clarity, text messaging and GPS. And with digital's more efficient use of spectrum, additional channels means new users can be added to a system.","New technology also helps first responder do their jobs better and more efficiently. For example, our tactical incident command feature replaces traditional voice roll calls with accountability functions embedded in the radio system. Using this feature, commanders can automatically keep track of first responders on-scene. The APX roll-call function provides an update on each first responder's radio and, when a critical situation arises, the large emergency button activates a mayday alarm signaling a first responder in distress. Another example of a cost-saving feature with many of our newer systems is that changes to radios can be programmed remotely, saving valuable time and resources previously required to perform field service on the equipment in the field.","We continue to expand our industry-leading portfolio to reach new markets and incremental users. We extended our ASTRO system to include a refreshed conventional option, a system type that is commonly deployed in rural communities. And the new APX 4500 is a vehicle mobile radio designed for public works, utilities and rural public safety.","New form factors also make radio solutions more compelling to new and different users like the new APX 3000 designed for covert operations. This radio helps undercover officers use a high-powered concealed radio while maintaining mission-critical communications. Or the MOTOTRBO SL Series, an ultrathin and lightweight portable radio designed for service and hospitality industries.","We now have over 24 different models on our APX radio platform, and this year we've added 15 new models to the MOTOTRBO family.","Platforming helps accelerate new product introductions, drive cost efficiencies and, by tiering features and pricing, we can compete in all areas from small rural agencies to large cities and from local to regional users.","I'd like to also spend a moment -- briefly to talk about the status of narrowbanding in the U.S. As you may know, the FCC established a VHF and UHF narrowband requirement nearly a decade ago that applies to approximately 30% of the installed base in the U.S. Most of these public safety users have spent years preparing for the January 2013 deadline. Some communities are now finishing their narrowbanding projects, although more than 50 waivers have been requested by smaller jurisdictions and large metro areas, many of which have outlined the significant effort that's remaining for them. The FCC has granted extensions to several applicants, ranging from several months to over 3 years. And while narrowbanding is a requirement impacting a portion of the market in the U.S., we continue to see solid international growth driven by the compelling features and applications that our new digital solutions offer globally.","Our professional and commercial radio portfolio continues a multi-quarter trend of outstanding performance with solid double-digit growth in Q3. With over 2 million devices shipped, the MOTOTRBO portfolio clearly leads the market as it transitions to digital. In fact, almost half of our professional and commercial revenues in 2012 have come from digital products, but there's still a significant opportunity ahead of us as the global installed base of about 40 million PCR radios is still over 90% analog.","Growth in Government was across both products and services. Services represents almost 30% of segment revenues, and we're currently executing on more than 700 installation and integration contracts in North America alone. Once these networks are deployed, we provide support services to these customers as well, given the mission-critical nature of the systems. As an example, in North America, we have over 3,000 support contracts with government customers.","During the quarter, we had several terrific new service wins, including an agreement with the state of Ohio valued at $80 million over 14 years, a $26 million Prince George\u2019s County in Maryland contract for 5 years and a $14 million agreement with the City of Phoenix for 6 years. Revenues are recognized over the life of these contracts.","Also, as public safety IP Networks become more complex, we're working with customers to create enhanced services offerings like the $17 million agreement with York County in South Carolina, which is a comprehensive lifecycle services contract where we'll upgrade, maintain and monitor all of their network components, including third-party equipment, for 7 years. Predictable fixed-fee arrangements like these help customers improve their total cost of ownership, avoid budget surprises and ensures that they have our latest system features during the life of the contract.","Now, moving on to the Enterprise segment. Sales in the Enterprise segment were 3 -- $632 million, a 13% decline from Q3 of 2011. Operating earnings were 12.2% of sales, compared to 18.6% last year.","Despite fewer large deals in the quarter, we're encouraged by continued dialogues and proposal activity among large customers planning for a technology refresh. I'm also encouraged by our backlog levels and traditional run rate business. Favorable growth drivers also remain, including increasing worker mobility, drive for operational efficiencies, demand for wireless access and expansion products.","This quarter, we announced the MC67, the industry's first rugged mobile computing handheld to incorporate a dual core OMAP processor with support for the latest generation of Microsoft Windows-embedded handheld. The MC67 builds on the success of over 600,000 MC55 and 65 enterprise mobile computers that are previously deployed, one of the industry's most field-proven platforms. The compact MC67 supports bandwidth-intensive applications for data capture of high-resolution images, concurrent voice and data communications, location-based services and other features for field service, field sales and direct delivery.","We also introduced the WAN version of the ET1 tablet for mobile task workers. Our ET1 industrial tablet has been enhanced with dual-mode WAN to bring the go-anywhere familiarity to a true enterprise-class device with enhanced durability, security and hot-swappable batteries for multi-shift use.","While our core focus remains in rugged mobile computing designed for line workers, we've also been investing in an important expansion category to provide devices for new users like retail sales associates and customer service personnel. For example, we've received a terrific customer feedback on the MC40, our first enterprise mobile computer with a full touch screen interface, and a task-specific device, our Smart Badge 1 product. These products are designed to perform tasks like scanning an item to check price and availability, reviewing product specifications and connecting managers and other employees with push-to-talk. The MC40 also enables mobile point of sale. Both of these products are now scheduled to begin shipping this quarter.","I'm also excited that we recently closed the acquisition of Psion. This investment strengthens our position in rugged mobile computing and bolsters our strategic position in important industrial segments like manufacturing, warehousing, ports and cold storage. Together with the Psion team, we'll be better positioned with improved scale, reach and leadership in the enterprise rugged mobile computing market.","One area of our Enterprise portfolio that saw continued growth was advanced data capture as favorable market trends, such as the conversion to 2D imaging, helped drive demand. This year, we've also seen the emergence of a new driver for our data capture business as retailers that previously didn't use bar codes now adopt scanners at the score -- store level to implement mobile coupons and customer loyalty programs. Some interesting new places where you'll now see these applications include large restaurant chains and coffee companies.","Now turning to a regional sales view for the company. North America grew by 9% while we saw declines in the other regions, Asia, 2%; EMEA, 3%; and in Latin America, a 9% decline although that was entirely driven by iDEN.","Overall, in our Government segment, we had growth across all regions, except in Asia, where sales were relatively flat. The North America regions saw exceptional growth in Government with double-digit growth. Sales declined across all geographies in our Enterprise segment.","This past quarter, we were recognized as the Official Mission-Critical Communications Provider of both national political conventions. Events like these bring together a diverse set of agencies from federal, state and local levels. In Tampa and in Charlotte, our interoperable solutions met the challenges of instant and seamless communications, providing real-time information to ensure that conventions were safe for thousands of delegates and the city's populations at large.","I'm also proud of our team for the recognition we recently received from Corporate Responsibility Magazine as a Top 10 Best Corporate Citizen in the information technology sector.","In closing, Q3 was another excellent quarter for us with consistent revenue growth, strong earnings growth, expanded operating margins and continued return of capital to shareholders. The fundamental demand drivers for our business remain solid, and we continue to invest and innovate for the future.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please remind our callers how they may ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the site of Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein.","Pierre Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I have a question on the evolution of your operating expenses. They were down $20 million sequentially and like $2 million year-on-year. I was wondering, first, if currency played a significant role in there. And then if you can give us as much visibility as you can on what other parts moved and how much of that is sustainable or more of a one-off? And then when we look into next year, as you integrate Psion, I would assume that there would be a high level of operational synergies there, and so I'm wondering how it's going to impact directionally your OpEx. And then more broadly, if you could give us some color on how you're managing OpEx at the moment on a day-to-day basis, if you have ongoing cost optimization program then and how you're thinking about operating costs reallocation as the time goes?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Okay, so there was -- you snuck in a bunch of questions in there, Pierre. I think we got most of them, and if not, we'll come back to you. On the costs in the quarter, FX had a slight impact, as we talked about. Top line was $42 million of FX impact. At the spending line, it was a few million dollars, probably $4 million or $5 million that offset that as a benefit. So the bottom line when we guided at the beginning of the quarter, really the net impact on earnings was effectively in line with what we expected. The top line was a bit higher than we expected. Remember, we talked about $35 million of impact on the top line. So costs from FX relatively minor in the quarter and they were relatively stable, which is very much in line with the way we've talked to you about our spending, that we're going to -- the spending may remain relatively stable, but we've done a lot of work to ensure that we're spending it in the right place. In other words, taking down certain areas that are not as critical and ramping up where we think we need to and from an innovation perspective and from a go-to-market perspective, so savings really on the G&A side. So we'll continue to go after that.","Gregory Q. Brown","Pierre, in relates -- as it relates to Psion, as we mentioned, we expect $60 million -- approximately $60 million of revenue in Q4. The guidance we're giving you of $0.98 to $1.03 EPS in Q4 also obviously incorporates Psion, which is probably a negative $0.02 in Q4, which includes the transaction fees and purchase accounting adjustments. Going forward, we're excited about the ability to integrate Psion into the enterprise mobile computing product group. There will be synergies, but nothing we're going to share at this point. I think we'll incorporate that and give you a little bit more color in the January earnings call. And as it relates to operating expense management, we, as a team, we're pleased with what we got done in Q3. We felt we did a pretty effective job around disciplined cost management. Now that said, we will continue to invest where we need to in R&D and maybe sales coverage and other areas where we think warrant the investment. But having said that, we will watch operating expenses carefully and prudently going into next year, and we will philosophically look for R&D and SG&A as a percentage of revenue to continue to improve over time.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Did that get everything that you asked, Pierre?","Pierre Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I think you got absolutely everything.","Operator","We'll go next to the site of Kulbinder Garcha with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question, Greg, on the narrowbanding effect. I think, last quarter you said it was 2 to 3 points of growth. I missed whether you mentioned what the impact has been year to date. And I guess, just on a wider comment, what confidence can you give us as we're getting closer to '13 that you're not borrowing sales from next year on the Government side given you are just so much above the normalized revenue growth rate in that business?","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes, and Kulbinder, so -- again, first of all, when we give you what we think around growth for the quarter, it's an estimate. But this quarter, for Q3, we think of the 12% Government growth, approximately 3% of that was narrowbanding driven. Remember, as I mentioned earlier, narrowbanding for UHF, VHF is 30% of the installed base in terms of kind of proportionately sizing it. As I mentioned, there's 50 -- currently 50-plus waivers that are filed with the SEC where customers will go beyond the January 2013 deadline. My view is that number will go up and many of these waivers will be granted, which my view means it won't necessarily be a cliff as we go from 2012 to 2013. I think kind of moving back, Kulbinder, there's no question narrowbanding helps. However, more broadly, the overall demand drivers for the business, new features, better efficiency, the aging of the installed base and quite frankly our Government growth outside of the U.S., which has been pretty robust, we think that'll continue. That's obviously incorporated in the 6% to 7% growth for Q4, but we expect Government to perform -- continue to expect strong, almost double-digit performance in Q4.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great, and just one other question on the margins in Government. As you hit these record highs, I guess, is there anything temporary in that just mix-wise that's driving it, or is this just maybe the effect of the portfolio introduction that you guys have been introducing over the last year coming through?","Gregory Q. Brown","I think it's a combination, Kulbinder. I think part of it is the portfolio where we have deepened and broadened both the APX and TETRA product portfolio, which expands the addressable market available to us and makes us more competitive at different price points. I also think that -- it's my sense that state and local governments and -- while not in great shape, of course, are incrementally improving. And as I mentioned earlier, we're getting just a little bit more positive indications from our customers that they're willing to spend a little bit more on public safety. And we've always said, quarter in and quarter out, that we think it remains a very high priority within these budgets and that not all government spending is equal and I think our results reflect that.","Operator","And we'll go next to the site of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","Question for you on LTE and as you look at it onto the future, you guys have previously said that you expect the revenue not to be material until 2014. Has anything changed in the U.S. or abroad that will perhaps impact your thoughts there, or if you can provide any color on your thoughts on LTE as we look out now and into the future?","Gregory Q. Brown","So I think that FirstNet obviously has been formed. They had their first board meeting in the end -- at the end of September. I think that process has to unfold and there's a lot of work to be determined there by FirstNet. That said, we feel very well positioned in LTE broadly, given the investments we made in previous periods from a product portfolio standpoint. I'd also remind you that I -- this is clearly not just a U.S. opportunity, it's a global opportunity. We've mentioned previously that we think LTE, as we kind of look out, is probably no more than $100 million of revenue in the second half of 2013. I think the large dimension of that $100 million will be more globally derived than U.S. derived, the Middle East being a particular attractive area for discussion. But just going back to FirstNet, I think they're going to work hard. And I also think, I'm confident that they will engage the public safety users in the states and put a high prioritization around the users, feature set for public safety, but that'll take several months and into 2013 to play out. But in the meantime, we continue to invest and I think we're well positioned, and of course, we're also well positioned with our strategic partner, Ericsson.","Operator","And we'll go next to the site of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Greg, I wondered if you can give us the backlog numbers for the quarter. And Ed, when you referenced the $1 billion of operating cash flow this year, was that a GAAP number or was that excluding the pension contribution?","Gregory Q. Brown","Backlog, Tavis, was relatively flat sequentially, essentially flat for both Government and Enterprise, excluding iDEN. Pretty pleased with it. Can we give the figure?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Yes.","Gregory Q. Brown","It's about $5.9 billion.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","So effectively flat. And on the operating cash flow, Tavis, it's $1 billion operating cash flow, that's all in. So it includes the pension contributions. And the only commentary that we made really during the call was to kind of people are looking at $1 billion of cash flow, you divide by 4, you might expect on a straight-line basis by quarter it'd be about $250 million. We're a bit lower than that, $182 million as we mentioned, really driven by -- primarily by the acceleration of that one pension payment of $72 million into Q3 a few weeks early to save some PBGC fees in '13. AR was elevated a bit as was inventory. But really, as we mentioned, it's really a timing-related item and we expect to close that gap, and again remain confident at $1 billion for the full year.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And so just to make sure my numbers are correct, that would presume somewhere very close to $500 million for the fourth quarter?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","That's right.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then final question, within your Government segment, remind me how big a percentage the private commercial radio is. And is that growing faster than the Government segment as a whole right now?","Gregory Q. Brown","I don't know that we've talked to the sizing of that. I think we've shown pie charts in the past, but I would say it's growing, I'd say, at relatively comparable rates with the rest.","Mark F. Moon","That's correct.","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes.","Operator","And we'll go next to the site of Craig Hettenbach with Goldman Sachs.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Greg, despite some of the weakness in Enterprise, you did mention you're encouraged by the backlog. So any commentary on that in terms of spending expectations for Q4?","Gregory Q. Brown","Well, so -- I mean, obviously Enterprise was weaker than we thought. But that said, if you normalize for foreign exchange, which was headwinds of about 3%, and iDEN, which declined 4% of the 13%, we're at about a 6% or 6.5% decline for Enterprise. Still not what we'd like it to be, but normalized for foreign exchange and iDEN. I think that there's fewer larger deals in terms of the year-over-year compare at the moment, but the discussions, the engagement, especially in the core verticals that we have, give us reasonable confidence and comfort into the guidance that we're giving you for Q4. I think that as we think about the full year, Craig, we think that Government segment on an annual basis will be double digit, and Enterprise, all in for the full year, will be mid-single digit decline, but that also obviously includes the planned-for decline in iDEN. And I like the fact that [indiscernible] and other people have some significantly new products coming out this quarter and next quarter. So while we're not pleased with it, clearly, we should be able to do better, I think we're managing it okay and we'll keep a close eye on it. But obviously, macroeconomic headwinds impact more the Enterprise segment than our Government public safety segment. We'll keep an eye on it.","Craig Hettenbach - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, if I could have a follow-up for Ed. The company continues to be aggressive in returning cash through buybacks as well as the dividend. But on the dividend front, you do have a lower payout than the overall market. I'm just curious to get your thoughts in terms of how you view that longer term. Is that an opportunity to kind of true up? And where do you stand in the dividend on a go-forward basis?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","That's something that we look at perpetually, Craig. And as I've talked about in the past, that's something we -- as we look at that, we look at that more on an annual basis, but as all part of the capital allocation strategy. We outlined a 25% to capital expenditures, 30% to dividend and 45% to that flexible combination of share repurchase or acquisitions. So that's where our current thinking is, but we'll continue to look at that over time to make sure that, that fits with our strategies, with acquisitions and the other elements of that allocation.","Operator","And we'll go next to the site of Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When we look at strategically long-term your big picture, I believe, earlier this year, you laid out some goals, which I think was kind of sales growth of, long term, about 5% to 8%. And I believe that was for more than just this year. It's for multiple years. And maybe I've misspoken on that, but I think that was the case. And if so, given the macro and climate plus the LTE, D Block changes and all these waivers going on, should that be reassessed or are other areas picking up to make it still in that confidence range?","Gregory Q. Brown","I think the short answer, Jim, is -- well, first of all, we're always going to look at it and continually reassess it periodically. But at this point, I don't see a need for that -- those kind of goalposts, long-term targets to change at this point. The dimensions may change, obviously. I think just picking up on LTE, I think LTE, for us more near term, will be more of an international contributor than a domestic U.S. contributor, which is different perhaps than what we thought several quarters ago. But in the main, I think we should be able to with the portfolio and the segments to be able to drive reasonable consistent top line growth. And whatever that growth rate is, then commensurately keep the P&L in shape where there's good operating leverage, which was -- which came through really well in Q3 with operating earnings growing 8% and revenue growing 3% and then earnings per share, of course, given the significant repurchase, growing at 27%. So it's all about growing the business but it's also, for us, all about operating leverage and investing capital with high return on invested capital to ensure a strong and superior return for shareholders.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up would be on the M&A front, Psion seems like a great natural fit there and a lot of synergies. Are there a lot more companies out there on the M&A front? How robust is your pipeline, and any changes in that given the recent economic uncertainty? Are more companies entering the pipeline or are valuations adjusting quick enough or kind of slower? How can we think about the acquisition, M&A pipeline?","Gregory Q. Brown","Thanks, Jim. I don't think -- I think the funnel around acquisitions for us and things to evaluate remains pretty constant. To your point, some valuations are getting a little bit more attractive. But at the end of the day, I think we're pretty disciplined around this and we're certainly not going to buy things just because we have money in our wallet. It's got to be a high strategic fit, a strong return on invested capital. We have to have the ability to execute and integrate the acquisition. Psion's ideal because it's in a space of mobile computing that we play and lead. And at the end of the day, whatever we acquire has to have a very, very high cultural compatibility quotient. Symbol had it, Psion has it. But we -- I would say it's a pretty steady view and stream of evaluations, but I don't think our thinking around acquisitions have changed in the last few quarters just because of the macroeconomics. It remains pretty consistent.","Operator","And we'll go next to the site of Jeff Kvaal with Barclays.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. Greg, could you spend a little bit more time talking about what is happening in the Enterprise side of the business. I mean, the x-iDEN revenue number last year was plus -- last quarter was plus 5%. Now you're talking normalized down mid-single digits. Obviously, the macro isn't great, but has it deteriorated that much? What are some of the drivers across the different regions that are hurting growth there?","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes, Jeff. So again, 13% year-over-year decline, normalized for FX, that takes it to about a 10% decline. You back out the $29 million iDEN decline -- and forgive me, I'm just doing the formula here, it takes us to about a negative 6% to 6.5% growth for the quarter. Remember, the previous compare was robust in Enterprise, it was up 13%. And I think, at the end of the day, it is really just fewer deals -- we also -- by the way, one other thing, we are no longer pursuing as aggressively as we were what I would call low-end WLAN sales in certain parts of Asia where we were ringing the bell on top line revenue, but the commensurate margin or profitability was more challenging. We've chosen to walk away from that and not compete. So we're not going to pursue revenue for revenue's sake. That was a contributor in the decline of our WLAN business. So those are kind of the ingredients. Mobile computing is down. At the end of the day we believe we're, for the most part, holding share, which is really important in these times. And as I mentioned, given the refresh in a number of new products in the Enterprise portfolio, we'll watch it closely, but we think we will be able to come back a bit and start to grow again.","Mark F. Moon","Jeff, just a little clarity. When Greg mentioned earlier that he felt optimistic about the funnel, when you think about regional clarity, Latin America, I would remind you, is up in Enterprise x iDEN. North America, there was 2 very large deals in the previous year. Absent those 2 large deals, it's mid- to high-single digit growth. EMEA is primarily due to FX, so given a comparable of approximately 20% in the prior year, we're very pleased with the performance in EMEA. And then in Asia Pacific, as Greg just mentioned, absent or normalized for the business or the product area that we decided not to pursue in China, Asia-Pac is also a high-single digit growth in Enterprise. And as we look forward to the fourth quarter and the guidance that we gave you, Enterprise growth in fourth quarter is mid-single digit growth. So I think that, while we're not proud of 13% decline, I think that's why we're speaking that we're also reasonably optimistic about where we are today.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Ed, on a follow-up, could you remind us how much of your buyback you have left?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","I think we've done 3-point -- I think we have $1.8 billion left of the last authorization, so about $1.8 billion.","Operator","We're going to go on to Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I know we did a lot of math on this iDEN and that seems to be a lot of the decline on a sequential basis as well, I mean, maybe -- I apologize if you mentioned this before, but it looks like iDEN was down over 50% sequentially. So it seems like it's almost pretty much out of the run rate and not going to impact Enterprise going forward anywhere near the extent that it did in the past. So we should actually see a softening effect in Enterprise going into next year. I just want to make sure that, that math is right, I got a number somewhere in the mid-30s for where iDEN is down to.","Gregory Q. Brown","So on iDEN, Hudie, it declined $29 million in Q3.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's a year-over-year example though, right?","Gregory Q. Brown","It is. We also talked on an annual basis that we thought it would be approximately $270 million for the full year of 2012. I think it's within the range of still being that, so -- and I think for the quarter in Q4, it's...","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Something a little bit less than the $29 million is what we're thinking. Something in the lower 20s.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","$20 million for Q3?","Gregory Q. Brown","For Q4.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","For Q4.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, so I'm right. So basically, it becomes smaller.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","It becomes a smaller piece, but the trajectory of it, Hudie, as we talked about it, it's somewhat of a similar trajectory is what we're thinking into 2013. But we'll give you more specifics on that in the next quarter's release.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. That's actually very helpful. There was a story out, and I don't know if you can comment on that but it was interesting, a day or 2 ago about the NS -- the deal in Scandinavia perhaps being reopened and someone looking into it or someone checked into it. I wondered if you could comment on that and is there any validity to that? Clearly, there isn't. But I mean how should we look at that story and if you've seen it?","Mark F. Moon","Yes, Hudie, this is Mark. I think, as you said, there was a story out where a competitor or a potential competitor in Norway had complained about the procurement process of the contract transfer from NSN that you're aware of to Motorola. That request is directed at DNK who is the customer in Norway. The customer feels very compelled with the process that they followed and the legal aspects that they looked at. We're obviously -- we're a piece of the contract before, now we've taken on a prime contract responsibility. So we feel confident that we'll continue to execute on the contract and moving forward and we'll let the process run its course in Norway with the customer.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then back to the Enterprise, and I don't mean to beat a dead horse on this, but clearly macro has a lot to do with the decline going on right now. How do you tell the difference between a cyclical and a secular issue with Enterprise? Home Depot is a huge account for you now and it was a big win and when you walk in there they all have Motorola handsets, and it's a great innovative system. But then you walk across the street to Lowe's and they're using iPhones now. How did -- did you compete for that Lowe's business or were you not allowed to compete because you were so big with Home Depot? And should we -- how should we be kind of viewing what Lowe's did with respect to how this business proceeds going forward?","Gregory Q. Brown","So I think, Hudie, and Mark and I will probably tag team this, but a couple of indications of the difference between cyclical and structural are: one, backlog; and two, the forward-looking funnel and the degree of discussion and engagement prospectively that we have with customers. Now I won't get into the detail per se. You're right, Home Depot is a great account, Microsoft orientation. We worked with them on several -- for several years. Lowe's chose a different path. I think that my view is oftentimes, whether it's Pepsi and Coke or McDonald's and Burger King or Home Depot and Lowe's, perhaps part of that decision was incorporated that if one company is going with one vendor, maybe somebody should consider going with another. That said, we watch closely folks like Apple and how visible they are or what degree of engagement they have with customers in the Enterprise. Remember, for us -- I know you know this, Hudie, our sweet spot is the industrial, rugged mobile computing. So we're doing the heavy lifting, the blue collar, the warehouse, the back office. Yes, we go into the store, of course, like a Home Depot. But we're going into a store with a rugged application, with a Microsoft orientation, with ubiquitous push-to-talk and customized applications and a durability factor with the device that's enterprise grade versus consumer. We will continue to watch more anecdotally. I mean, Apple continues to -- we see anecdotal evidence of those conversations with certain Enterprise customers, but it's more TBD. We feel, overall, pretty solid about our position. We'll continue to invest in it and we'll watch to ensure that we're not just breathing our own fumes here on cyclical versus structural.","Mark F. Moon","Just a quick add, too, is that we did compete for the business. Obviously, we don't want to lose any piece of the business. But I would just add that Lowe's is still a very strong customer for us. While Apple did go throughout the store associates with the units that you just mentioned that you see when you go in the store, we still do the wireless LAN network for them, we still do other aspects and we continue to work very closely with Lowe's just as we did with all of our customers.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. Can you just give a quick update on the Android units and your conversion to Android? Is that just a part of the portfolio, or will you be keeping both Windows and Android going?","Gregory Q. Brown","I think you'll see us do both. I mean, obviously the installed base is overwhelmingly Microsoft. Windows 8 -- by the way, I should have mentioned Windows 8 too. I think that, that is part of the pause in Enterprise spending in part. I can't give you a quantifiable number, but as Windows 8 comes closer, I think some customers wait to see what it's about and its affordability and how we incorporate it in our portfolio. Hudie, we'll continue to do both Android and Microsoft. We're in very good strategic discussions with Microsoft at the highest levels. And we will look to incorporate in the future some devices around Windows 8 that'll support the customized apps and do comprehensive security and VPN support and integrate and optimize voice over WiFi and enterprise WLAN, so we'll do both.","Operator","And we'll go next to the site of Matthew Hoffman with Cowen.","Matthew Hoffman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Another narrowbanding question. If I'm reading your comments correctly, compared to the 3 points of growth you estimate you got in the Government business this quarter, next year in 2013, we should expect the effect of narrowbanding to be lower because of the wind down of the mandate's effect. But there are 50 municipalities out there looking for extensions, so it should be greater than 0. Is that the right way to frame that argument out? And then I'll have a follow-up.","Gregory Q. Brown","Basically, yes, Matthew. It'll be greater than 0 given the 50-plus and there very well be more waivers between now and the end of the year. So yes, that's probably the right way to frame it.","Matthew Hoffman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Right. Then can you help us think about the 50 relative to the overall addressable opportunity within the mandate, so we can -- help us size that?","Gregory Q. Brown","I can't because I don't -- I can't dimensionalize or quantify the 50 or size it and the mix between rural and major metro. Maybe on the next earnings call as we exit 2012 and look forward in '13 we'll have a better appreciation of framing it and quantifying it.","Mark F. Moon","Matthew, just a couple of -- just to give you a little bit more color on that to maybe make you feel you a little more comfortable. Remind that Greg made in his comments that the narrowbanding mandate is just 30% of the user base. So even when you're talking about the residual, you still got the rest of the population of users in North America. I would also remind you that the narrowbanding mandate is not an international phenomenon. And when you look at our Government growth internationally year-to-date, we're 20-plus percent in Latin America, and mid- to high-single digits in Europe and in Asia. So that's why we say if you think about the falloff from narrowbanding, certainly it's going to impact the growth in North America, but we still are seeing very strong growth internationally and in North America as a result of new product introductions, all of our offerings and the benefits that we provide to our customers.","Matthew Hoffman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I appreciate the color. One last one, a housekeeper. Wireless LAN, I didn't hear you call it out on the Enterprise side. Can you just fill us in on the trends there in the wireless LAN business?","Gregory Q. Brown","Wireless LAN declined for us year-over-year. I think, I mentioned earlier, in part because we chose not to pursue some lower-priced, lower-margin, low access point opportunities primarily in Asia, actually mainly in China. But it did decline for us year-over-year and we would look for that to improve going forward.","Operator","And we'll go next to the site of Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","When you look at your platform investments, you talked about Windows and Android, but could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about investments into app developments themselves, potential software to be more vertically integrated with your customers?","Gregory Q. Brown","So 2 things in that regard, Ben. We do work closely with our independent software vendors to ensure that vertically specific apps are customized, whether it's retail or transportation logistics. In some very large accounts, we have some of those software app people doing that customization with the Motorola badge. The other things around app development is the acquisition we made of Rhomobile or RhoElements. And the notion is that we, over time, provide an HTML5 tool kit, an SDK, if you will, where app developers write to that, that's agnostic. It's indifferent to whether it's Windows 8, Android 4.0 or iOS. So we have a common tool kit that's written at the browser level that's then supported irrespective of the underlying operating system. So we're really doing it on 2 levels: working customized apps organically internally and with ISV partners today, Microsoft and Android; and investing in a software element that can simplify the portability of applications and lower the costs and make it more ubiquitous over multiple operating systems. That's the twofold strategy we're pursuing.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, you look at Psion, you gave us the 4Q run rate. Could you give us an idea on the annual run rate kind of the margin profile of that business and the headcount? And then, where's the onshore, offshore cash stand at the end of 3Q?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","So a couple of things. First of all, on the onshore, offshore, I think the cash balance was somewhere in the mid-30s, so kind of consistent with where you'd expect, $3.5 billion in total. On the Psion business, I think I'd keep it very high level. I did talk about the impact for the fourth quarter being a negative $0.02 per share. Really, coming in, the business is roughly breakeven x those purchase accounting and transaction-related fees that are out there related to that transaction. Going forward, you would expect that we will drive to improve that -- the earnings of that business such that, as we've talked about previously, it will be accretive on a non-GAAP basis in 2013. And on a non -- on a GAAP basis, it should be accretive in 2014. So the plan is definitely to improve the profitability of that business such that the return on invested capital that we assumed on that business when we acquired it comes to fruition.","Gregory Q. Brown","And the headcount, Ben, is approximately 800 people.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from the site of Blaine Carroll with Avian Securities.","Blaine R. Carroll - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. First of all, on the narrowbanding, is there any incentive for the 70% that don't need to move to that 12.5 kilohertz? Is there any benefit for them to move to it, I mean, could that extend the narrowbanding process as well?","Mark F. Moon","Certainly. I think when we talked about the growth that's occurring, certainly we talked about the contributor of narrowbanding. But we also talked a lot -- when you think about double-digit growth and we said narrowbanding and double-digit in the U.S. and narrowbanding contributing to 3% of our overall growth, we talked a lot about the aspect of moving from analog to digital and the new features, the better efficiency that's there, the ability to add more users because you're spectrum efficient when you do that. The fact that a number of the 70%, if you will, which was your question, are aging infrastructures, they need to upgrade anyway, so they're attracted to the digital aspects of the system. So that, again, is a big explanation of why we're getting growth way beyond just narrowbanding.","Blaine R. Carroll - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then there's a new product out that's predominantly or prominently displayed on your website, the HC1 headset computer. I'm wondering if you could talk about that device and what your sort of prospects are for that.","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes, I think that's really much more of a niche device. It's got a high ASP price point. And I think you're looking -- you're referring to the helmet computer device. I think it's -- I love the fact that we have it. It's a small addressable market and I would look to it to be more niche application than broad based.","Blaine R. Carroll - Avian Securities, LLC, Research Division","Any thoughts on -- this to me looks like that Google glass application. Any thoughts of moving it over into that space, or is this just a...","Gregory Q. Brown","No, I think this is more of a demonstration of the innovation capabilities and where we have a very unique set of requirements for clients, we'll sell it in kind, but I don't think it's -- it's more representative of the art of the possible and for very unique circumstances to fill that need, but I wouldn't look at that product as expecting any broad-based deployment.","Operator","And I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks.

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'd like to make a few opening comments about the second quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook.","First, Q2 was a strong quarter of earnings, cash flow generation and backlog growth compared to last year. With a growing Product backlog and healthy pipeline, we're well positioned for the second half of the year and we'll continue to focus on revenue and operational efficiency.","Second, our Services business continues to execute, growing 26% including Airwave, while our managed and support services business grew 4% organically and we're proceeding full steam ahead with the integration of Airwave after recently receiving unconditional clearance from the UK Competition and Markets Authority just a few weeks ago.","And finally, today we announced a $2 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization. This follows $11.6 billion in total repurchases over the past five years, driving a 51% share count reduction. The steady improvement in our business and continued managed and support services growth will generate strong earnings in cash flow driving total shareholder return.","I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on our second quarter results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Greg. Second quarter results include revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5% versus last year, including Airwave revenue of $146 million, GAAP operating earnings of $224 million, non-GAAP operating earnings of $324 million, or 22.7% of sales, up 370 basis points from the year-ago quarter.","GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.61 compared $0.72 in the second quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.03, which represents a 51% year-over-year increase. The earnings per share growth was driven by Airwave, continued cost savings and reduced share count.","Ending backlog was up $2.2 billion from a year ago. Services is up $2.1 billion on $1.6 billion from Airwave, as well as managed and support services growth in North America. The Product segment backlog was up $64 million, also driven by North America. For the remainder of call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook.","As expected, Q2 Product sales were down 8% from the prior-year at $801 million. The majority of the decline was due to weakness in Latin America, parts of Europe and China. Q2 Product segment operating income was $176 million, or 22% of sales, up 170 basis points versus last year, driven by steady margins and a lower cost structure. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $64 million from last year and up $82 million sequentially. Deal flow and orders have been solid, particularly in North America, supporting our expectations for Product revenue growth in the second half.","Turning to Services, Q2 Services revenue was $629 million, up 26% percent including Airwave. In Q2, managed and support services comprised approximately 30% of total MSI revenue. Organically, managed and support services grew 4% during the quarter.","Services operating income was $148 million or 23.5% of revenue, up 670 basis points from the prior-year. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $2.2 billion versus last year. The backlog growth is attributed to $1.6 billion of Airwave in EMEA and an increase of over $500 million in North America. Sequentially, Services backlog decreased $214 million, including a $170 million FX adjustment related mostly to the British pound.","Total OpEx from continuing operations was $362 million, down $31 million or 8% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost reduction activities. Other income and expense was $57 million compared to $39 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $54 million compared to $39 million a year ago.","Q2 operating cash flow was $292 million, an increase of $143 million over the prior year, driven bring improved working capital and higher earnings. Free cash flow was $201 million. We ended Q2 in a net debt position of $3.5 billion. We repurchased $555 million of stock during the quarter at an average price of $68.37. And finally, we paid dividends of $72 million in the quarter.","Turning to our outlook, we expect Q3 sales growth of 6% to 7%, including $130 million from Airwave. We expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS between $1.17 and $1.22. Our view of the full year outlook remains unchanged. Revenue growth of 5% to 7% and non-GAAP EPS of $4.45 to $4.65. Operating expenses of approximately $1.45 billion, a reduction of $120 million inclusive of the additional Airwave OpEx.","Full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 33%. Operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and $4.75 to $5 of free cash flow per share for the full year.","Moving to regional results, North America performed as expected, with revenue down slightly at 1% versus a strong quarter a year ago. Demand for our managed and support services continues to drive multi-year contract wins, while backlog growth, in both Products and Services, supports our expectation of growth in the region in the second half and for the full year.","As expected, Latin America was down 36%, or $34 million, on continued challenging macroeconomic conditions and iDen declines. While we expect the region to remain challenged, the business is stabilizing and we are encouraged with a recent large order of $28 million. EMEA was up 47% inclusive of Airwave. Excluding Airwave, the region was down 17% primarily related to lower Norway installation revenue and weakness in Eastern Europe. Asia Pac declined 2% on currency headwinds and a decline in China. Excluding currency, Asia Pac grew 1% driven primarily by growth in Australia.","I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. In our Products segment, we continue to innovate with several key product launches and customer-focused solutions, including the launch of several new radios, including a low cost digital Vertex radio addressing the low end of the channel, as well as a new high tier TETRA radio. We also announced the addition of the WAVE 7000 solution to our software portfolio. WAVE 7000 software enhances workgroup communication with high availability push-to-talk, linking users across LMR and LTE networks regardless of radio, smartphone, tablet or other device.","In our P25 ASTRO portfolio, we won several large systems deals, including a $200 million multi-county award in the Richmond, Virginia area. We also received a $44 million order from a North America utility customer and in July, we won a $28 million order in Latin America, the first deal in the region over $10 million in the past six quarters.","In our Services business, we launched WAVE Cloud Connect in Australia. This SaaS cloud-based solution leverages WAVE 7000 to deliver broadband based secure push-to-talk communications, connecting LMR networks with smartphones and tablets.","In our managed and support services business we are proceeding with the integration of Airwave following the unconditional clearance from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority. We secured many large services deals, including a $19 million renewal to extend services with a key customer in Australia and in the command center, we received multiple orders in North America for software, services, and application providing customers with advanced analytics and operational intelligence.","I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Gino. Let me just close with a couple of quick thoughts. In Q2, we executed well, both financially and operationally. In addition to growing sales, earnings and cash flow, we launched several new products and continue to invest in growing the business.","Looking forward, I'm encouraged with our progress heading into the second half of the year. Backlog is up in both Products and Services. North America remains solidly on course. Latin America is showing signs of stabilizing and we expect the Products segment to return to revenue growth.","And finally, we remain firmly committed to growing the earnings and cash flow of our business. This commitment includes being responsible stewards of capital and is reflected in our capital return history and today's announcement of a $2 billion increased authorization. Driving continued durable earnings and strong cash flow from our business enables financial flexibility for the further return of capital, strategic acquisitions and organic innovation.","And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Chris.","Chris Kutsor - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I would like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow up to accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Pierre, your line is open. Do you have us on mute?","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hello. Can you hear me?","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes. We can now, Pierre.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. Sorry for that. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to make sure I get your guidance for Q3 and what your full-year guidance implies for Q4, right. So am I right thinking that your organic growth in the third quarter would be still slightly negative, but it's reasonable to expect that you will be posting positive organic growth year-on-year in Q4? And then I'd have a very quick follow-up on gross margins. So you delivered a very good improvement in gross margins sequentially this quarter. If you could give us some color that what were the drivers behind that? And whether we should expect continued improvement in gross margin in the second half of the year? Thank you.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, Pierre, on Q3 and second half full year outlook, we think it's supported by the fact that product backlog is up, both sequentially and annually. To your point, we expect products revenue to improve in Q3 and return to growth in Q4. We mentioned the fact that Latin America is stabilizing. We had a $28 million order, the largest in four years and we do expect organic growth to return in the second half. On gross margins, I'll turn it to Gino.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes. On gross margins, Pierre, we've seen an improvement in gross margins as expected, driven by the Services segment. Margins remain constant in the Product segment and the return to the mid-30s as we've talked about for a couple of quarters, once the systems integration activity related to one specifically large project subsided, it returned to mid-30s for gross margins.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Pierre.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. I have just a couple of questions. One just on second half revenues. If you hit your Q3 guidance, you're going to have to grow in the mid-20s or close to that, I think, sequentially to your full year number. On just the visibility you have around Q4, is that (17:28) by the backlog as well or is it just your Q3 guidance is fairly conservative. Any comments around that would be helpful. And then on the $2 billion extra buyback, what's the cadence of how you will deploy that? Is that something we think about over the six quarters? Just how you think about that that would be helpful. Thanks.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, Kulbinder, I think that our view of full year is supported by both backlog improvement in both Product and Services. We especially like the fact that we expect and anticipate Product revenue to improve significantly in Q3 and return to growth in Q4. When you de-layer that, we believe the business organically returns to the growth in the second half. I think it's a combination both of backlog and aged backlog visibility and the pipeline that Molloy and the worldwide team see at this point.","In terms of the share repurchase authorization, we have $400 million left in the authorization. We bought back $555 million in Q2. In composite over the last five years, we have repurchased 11.6 billion as I mentioned, a 51% reduction in share count at an average price of $57.58. We had previously referred to the fact that on an annual basis, we expected $750 million to $1 billion in share repurchase for this fiscal year. I think that remains unchanged. I think the higher volume in Q2 represents what we found to be opportunistic and we seized on that opportunity.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Cabral with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. I wanted to dig into the growth in managed and support services. And if you could just help us understand how you're going after that opportunity from a go-to-market perspective, as well as if these are largely greenfield opportunities or if these are competitive take-outs that you're seeing. And then just from a margin perspective, any sense for how this business stacks up relative to the wider corporate average would be helpful?","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, this is Bruce Brda. I'll take your question. The growth in managed and support was driven heavily by the Airwave introduction into our portfolio, but we also saw organic growth in managed and support services as well in the mid-single digits. That's comparable to the growth we achieved through 2015 as well. Managed and support is really attached to our Product. So there isn't competitive takeaways. This is driving up penetration into our install base and attaching managed and support services to more new deals as well. On a going forward basis, as Gino mentioned with the Norway integration project behind us, we would expect margins to be comparable in the mid-30s on a going forward basis.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. And then on operating expenses, clearly, that's been a big focus for the company over the past few years. But as we start thinking about looking out beyond 2016, do you feel there's still room for cost takes-outs from currents levels or after you've completed the $120 million that you're going to do this year? I guess any color on how you're thinking about managing costs in more of a normalized environment would be helpful.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, I think that the team has done a fantastic job as we've simplified the organization, streamlined the portfolio and focused on what we do well from G&A to manufacturing rationalization to real estate footprint across the board. And Brda, in particular, platforming R&D has done a great job.","I think I'd make two points. We always believe you can do more. But, as we think about 2017, we certainly are not expecting an increase in BGM OpEx against the current profile of the business. That's the way I would think about it at this point in time.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. I've got a couple of questions so let me get them out and then you can answer. First, given the decline in the pound, a couple of issues related to that. Can you talk about what Product backlog trends would have been sequentially and year-over-year under a cost currency? Would that be growing sequentially and year-over-year? And also on the pound decline, is the $146 million of Airwave revenue this quarter relative to the $130 million expectation for next quarter, is that pound related or is there variability in that revenue extreme?","And then second, Greg, on FirstNet, I understand kind of even the uncertainties are uncertain at this point. But, I guess, any color you'd like to give on that. And then, specifically, I guess, Rivada Networks has an agreement with a number of industry players, Motorola not one of them. And what I'm wondering in that regard is given your share of embedded systems on P25, is there a conceivable way to integrate with those systems without having Motorola involved in some form or fashion? Thanks.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I'll let Gino start with the pound.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure. So a couple of comments on the pound. The impact of the pound to backlog is most visible in Services' multiyear duration. So, as we mentioned earlier, $170 million revaluation is included in that. Keep in mind as well as we \u2013 revenue Airwave, the fixed contract in Airwave that is a decline for the Services backlog as well. So those were two elements that went into that $210 million sequential decline in Services.","With respect to the $146 million to $130 million, that is entirely due to the pound. There's no change to the contract. The contract is fixed. We continue to expect $450 million of revenue for the full year. The prior estimate we gave was a prudent conservative estimate based on a couple of things. Uncertainty around Brexit and completion of the purchase accounting and the deferred revenue calculation. So our expectation continues to be $450 million of revenue. The contract is fixed and $146 million to $130 million is entirely a result of the pound.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","And, Tavis, as it relates to FirstNet, what I would say is we've obviously participated in the RFP response. I think we're very well positioned for a combination of reasons. Number one is our expertise in public safety. Number two, is our go-to-market strength and customer intimacy and sales force, and third, I think a little bit in reference to your question, I think the unique ability for us to be able to interconnect Public Safety LTE to the LAN mobile radio systems that are installed here in the U.S.","As you know, we don't expect any really FirstNet revenue expectations for this year or next year but I like the position that we have. And I like how we have responded to the RFP and we'll leave it up to the customer to decide what the right architecture and consortium is to go forward.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Okay. Thank a lot.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Tavis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon. Hey, Bruce. Maybe you can fill us in in terms of the managed and support services? I think you guys said 4% growth for the quarter. Can you break out versus the U.S versus the Rest of the World?","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, in Managed and Support, we've been experiencing pretty consistent growth throughout all of the regions. It's heavier in North America but we've got great growth across all the regions in managed and support. That's on the organic side obviously. When you add in Airwave, it heavies up in EMEA but it's consistent across all regions.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. Great. And then if we just talk about the LTE environment, has there been any significant developments around the world? Obviously, you guys are working on the two Middle East contracts but are there any RFPs that are going on \u2013 outside of FirstNet, of course, that would give you some encouragement the LTE environment's growing?","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I would say outside of the big four projects, LA, London, and the two in the Middle East, of course, FirstNet being the fifth, I would describe the Public Safety LTE opportunity as a bit fluid and slow. We don't expect any meaningful revenue. I talked about FirstNet already. We don't expect any meaningful revenue this year or next year on ESN in London either. So, I think it's fairly methodical and measured. We're focused on implementing the big four. We're focused on winning FirstNet, and I think that as time has gone on there's also an increased realization that LAN mobile radio will be around for a long, long time. And the interconnection between Public Safety LTE, which is additive to the installed base of LMR is pretty meaningful. But that's the way I would describe it. Our revenue 2015 and 2016 is comparable, about $130 million and I think I would expect even though we're not guiding into next year I think it would be \u2013 our LTE revenue would be comparable in 2017 as well.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Two questions, if I could. First, back to the Services, a big focus for the company and Airwave was a nice move. Greg, could you talk a little bit about other potential buy opportunities or whether you can build it or other opportunities you think that will be out there for you to either organically or inorganically grow that business?","And on to the Products side, it sounds like, overall for public safety still you guys are in the early stages of body cameras and other things, could you just talk a little bit about maybe some other new products that you think could kind of move the needle a little bit more in the next twelve months? Thank you.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. On Services, we love the Airwave acquisition. We're especially appreciative and pleased with the unconditional clearance from CMA. We're always on the look or lookout for other what we refer to as \"mini Airwaves,\" if they're there. I think there might be some, but they're not nearly as material or of the revenue density as Airwave. Having said that, I think Molloy and Brda are teaming well to get a lot of the managed and support services growth organically, better sales execution, software user agreements, multi-year maintenance, and I think Jack's team has done a really good job attending to that.","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","On the second part of your question, Tim, this is Bruce Brda, with respect to body-worn video, we really have two portions of our solution here. One is the evidence management solution or the back end that stores the digital evidence, and we've taken an approach where we've integrated that in with our other command center software assets, call-taking, CAD, records, counsel, et cetera. And then on the device itself, with the demands on the officer for on-body real estate we've taken an integrated approach, an integrated voice, so remote speaker mic, with video recording as well as radio control on a single platform and we think that gives us a unique advantage in the marketplace. Having said that, this is really a try before you buy market and while we're engaged with a number of customers around the U.S. and some internationally as well, and we made initial shipments in Q2, we don't expect the revenue for 2016 to be material with body-worn video.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stanley Kovler with Citi. Please go ahead.","Stan Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about backlog and specifically in Services. So if I back out the FX impact you referenced for Services, and there's a little bit of rounding in the $8.2 billion total that you quoted but Services looks like it may have been flat to perhaps down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. Can you help us understand how the pipeline looks? You quoted specifically some wins that you've had regionally in North American and other places. How does the second half look in terms of the buildup in backlog and where do you think you'll exit the year? Thanks.","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure. So just recapping Services backlog, Services backlog sequentially was down $210 million. $170 million of that is in adjustment to our backlog position based on the pound. And as we recognize the $146 million of revenue, in Q2, against the fixed Airwave contract, the result of those two was a decrease in sequential backlog.","Obviously, absent those two we did have sequential backlog growth in Services. We did grow managed and support services specifically 4% organically. So from a backlog perspective, heading into the second half with respect to Services, we're comparable to slightly ahead of where we were in the prior year.","Stan Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. And if I can just follow-up, as you look out at the environment for public safety especially with what's been going on in Europe, what does your pipeline look like on from a Product perspective and in terms of actual Products and perhaps this is on both hardware and software that you're talking to with customers out there and what's the urgency level and time-to-market of any kind of deployments there?","Jack P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","So, Stanley, this is Jack. I think a couple \u2013 maybe two comments on Europe particularly in Europe but our comps from an overall perspective as we start to look at the second half of 2016, our comps eased due to the Norway roll off.","To your point around security, in Europe, in fact, I just talked to our Head of Sales in EMEA the other day on this. There's certainly border security issues that we think can stimulate both Product and Service revenue opportunities but they're not moving super rapidly. There's funding around them and there's governance and things like that. But we definitely see business in the second half picking up largely due to comps.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I do also think though from an overall tone standpoint in addition to what's going on in Europe and the climate for policing here in the U.S., we've always said mission-critical public safety is high on the priority list. It's as high as it's ever been and it's reinforced by some of the unfortunate circumstances that are going on.","What I would say also anecdotally while you did ask about Europe, I think we've seen some increased interest particularly around the older systems here in the U.S. with a sensitivity around encryption and protected police communications. So systems here in the U.S. that might be older, longer in the tooth, if you will, where the bad guys may unfortunately have the opportunity with not too much effort to listen in. I think some of those communities are engaging in those conversations with us, making encryption and secure communications a higher priority vis-\u00e0-vis an upgrade and a modernization that I think over time will be a positive demand driver.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Brian (35:10) on for Vijay. Thanks for taking the question. Could you give us some visibility around expectations of geographic demand in the back half of 2016 and then maybe into 2017? So any detail around what you're seeing in China, Eastern Europe or Latin America? Thanks.","Jack P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Okay. Brian (35:35), it's Jack. So I think as we look at the second half, obviously it's not appropriate to comment on 2017 right now. But in general to give you some regional color, North America in the second half, which is obviously our biggest region, as we said all along, North America will grow in 2016. Product pipeline, as well as Services pipeline look strong.","We talked about Latin America, and again, Latin America is less than 5% of our overall revenue. Again, less pressure in the second half due to comps. We also believe we've de-risked a lot of the large projects there. And, I think on the bright side, we see Southern Latin America improving. We see the business in Mexico stabilizing. And I think the big point there is in spite of some of the headwinds we faced in the last 12 months, we've maintained our investment in the region. And we think we've created a good level of demand that we'll fulfill here in the future.","When we think about EMEA, which I just commented on, Europe, Middle East and Africa, again, our comps ease in Europe. There is a fair level, even in spite of oil, in the Middle East, the business remains strong. I think one point of emphasis here would be in Africa. Africa is an area, really what I would say is an area that we've invested in. We're investing in more significantly in go-to-market. We've shored up kind of our lower end of our portfolio product that we think is very attractive in the African market. And then if we \u2013 as we start to pivot to Asia Pac, Asia Pac is actually \u2013 it's been a good news story. In constant currency last year it grew 8%. It will be up this year in constant currency, particularly, and again as Gino highlighted in the opening in Australia. I will tell you China, China is less than 3% of our Company's revenue. 2016 will be a challenging year. But we've got really suppressed expectations candidly about China, just due to some of the preference that I think the Chinese government has towards some of the indigenous providers. So, I think that's probably a summary of the fly over as we see it regionally around the world.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew DeGasperi with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Andrew DeGasperi - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah, thanks. First, I guess I wanted to ask what timing do you expect as far as revenue recognition for the Richmond P25 project that you won. And secondly, if we look at buybacks guidance that you gave the last quarter, you obviously bought a lot of stock in the second quarter. Should we be expecting \u2013 I mean, we should be planning for a significant slowdown at this point in the second half, is that correct? Thanks","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I'll let Jack answer Richmond first.","Jack P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Andrew, on Richmond, it's a multiyear revenue expectation. We'll have a small amount in the back half of this year. But it's again, it's a multi-year as a lot of these big milestone based projects are.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","And, Andrew, on the share repurchase, we guided annual repurchase of $750 million to $1 billion. We were out of the market largely in Q1 because of the Airwave M&A activity. We were opportunistic given what we thought were pretty attractive levels in Q2. I think our annual guidance remains unchanged of $750 million to $1 billion. So, I would just leave it at that and that would be our expectation at this point in time for the full year.","Andrew DeGasperi - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. This is Ashwin on behalf of Rod. Thank you for taking my question. Could you update us on the expectations of FX impact on full year revenue? I think the previous number was $60 million of FX impact. An update would be great. And can you also comment on your expectations about Product operating margin in Q3 and second half generally? Do you expect to see same seasonal margin trend on the Products, I mean, in Q3 and Q4 like we saw recently?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure. I'll take the \u2013 actually I'll take both of those. The FX question first. Certainly, the FX is included in the guidance we gave for the full year. We said after the \u2013 on the Q4 call and Q1 we said we saw at the time based on spot rates headwind of about $60 million. At this point, we see headwinds in the $40 million range for the full year. But, again, it's contemplated within the guidance. Specifically, the volatility has been around the pound. And, again, we haven't changed our view of full year revenue for Airwave at $450 million despite the movement in the pound.","Secondly, on Product gross margins, you can expect to see the same type of seasonality, certainly as the volume increases in Products in the second half of the year.","Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to go back on this LTE question. Greg, could you talk maybe a little bit to the services and device opportunities you see Motorola addressing with Public Safety LTE? So services, data, devices, voice products, where you think you are there? And then longer-term how you think about the potential risk as LTE voice devices potentially displace terrestrial radio devices? And then I have a follow-up.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I think that the PS-LTE opportunity, as I mentioned, is slow to develop. It's certainly a lot slower and less material than we thought three years ago, just to reference a point, or even when the legislation was passed in the Middle Class Jobs Relief Act in 2012 it was U.S.-centric. I think it's for a combination of reasons. Countries have to develop and allocate the spectrum. You've got to line up the appropriate funding. I do think, though, we're very uniquely positioned, positively, better than anybody, quite frankly, and I say that as a reflection of our knowledge and expertise in P25 and TETRA LMR and the complexities and customization that go with that and the interoperability and interconnection required of LMR platforms, whether they be P25 or TETRA to the additive broadband network that gets deployed.","I think it would span services, some applications, devices, I don't see consumer smartphones replacing mission-critical radios for a whole host of reasons around power management, spectrum, efficiency, group talk, as well as things that are embedded in the 3GPP standard and so many other things that would be required for that to happen. So I think Public Safety LTE is a good opportunity for this company. I think it's additive to our LMR business. I don't think there's \u2013 it's substitutional or cannibalizing in the future.","I just don't see that. And I don't think it's a reflection of our head in the sand. I really don't because we push ourselves constantly here and challenge each other. It's a direct reflection of what we're hearing from our customers and it's worth reminding in LA, we are building an LMR system at the same time and updating an LMR systems right now at the same time PS-LTE is being deployed. That's also true in the UK, which you know about the commitment to multiyear fixed price contract with Airwave and the eventual migration to ESN. And we'll see how quickly that happens and in what complementary nature ultimately that gets rolled out in.","And the two Middle East customers, right as we speak, are investing in LMR, and Public Safety LTE and we're getting Service contracts that are multiyear 10 years, 15 years plus. So the customers are speaking and the market is speaking. And we're going to seize on both those opportunities.","So Public Safety LTE is more muted. Again, $130 million last year, comparable this year. I would guess it's comparable maybe slightly up next year as we round out those implementations but between infrastructure, devices, applications and the interconnection to make the end-to-end system work, I think we're well positioned.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks. The other question I had is looking at the contracts that you talked about, how do you view the average duration of your contracts? Is there a pattern? Are they extending? There's been this percentage figure you disclosed in our 10-K of the percentage of backlog that you recognize in subsequent years has actually been declining so I'm trying to see if there's a read through there.","And then final piece, curious why Airwave revenue sees no adjustment this year but does see adjustment in future years. Is there something built into that contract that it's booked and recognized this year already so the pound movement doesn't influence it or is there something else that's plays into that? Thank you.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","So let me do Airwave and then I'll turn it over to Molloy for contracts. The reason our guidance on Airwave revenue of $450 million is unchanged despite the contraction in the pound is a tip of the hat to Bonanotte and the finance team because as we modeled he and the team modeled different scenarios right at the close of the acquisition. We knew that there was uncertainty out there with Brexit. We wanted to get the contract in hand; we wanted to get the organization integrated. So Gino and team were prudent. So even with the pound contraction of about 15%, maybe 16%, since that Airwave acquisition was done we're not changing our revenue guidance of approximately $450 million. At this point, given the spot rate in the pound, we would expect Airwave revenue to grow next year because we have 12 months of revenue recognition versus 10 months.","Jack P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Okay, Greg. So I think the second \u2013 Ben, to the second question around projects think of \u2013 dimensionalize it two ways or two things. Most of these projects won \u2013 by the way, projects were proud to have won, the Richmond area that we talked about, we spoke about King County last year, in the State of Iowa. These are essentially multi, you know, we talk about \u2013 they could be hundreds of sites and so each and every one of those sites kind of has life story themselves meaning civil, permitting, environmental, OSHA, those kind of requirements that tend to have longer duration. So we typically think of those things taking anywhere from 12 months to really two years to revenue to get through all the ratable things. That's the first piece of it.","And then typically also within those contracts there's a device component and those things are more actionable and we can work with customers to pull those in for revenue. But ultimately each project has its own dimension. A lot of them are civil and site related, longer duration, the second piece of it is devices. We can typically action those with customers in a quicker fashion.","And then the last element of them is obviously the multi-year support and I think it's noteworthy because it's been brought up a few times today but every \u2013 basically every customer in North America and typically in a lot of different countries overseas now doesn't enter into an agreement until they think about at least five years. We've had customers that have gone up 20 years of life cycle and managed and support service agreements. So those obviously have even longer duration in those revenue every year. So I think that probably answers your question.","Operator","Thank you.

Good afternoon, and thanks everybody for joining us today. I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook.","Look, first, Q1 was a strong quarter and an excellent start to the year. We grew revenue 7%; ended the quarter with record backlog; we significantly expanded operating margins; we grew earnings; and we generated much higher cash flow.","Second, I'm very pleased with our continued progress in Services. Our operational execution was strong, the Services segment growing double-digit this quarter including acquisitions, and we also acquired Interexport in Chile, adding a valuable managed services hub in Latin America.","From a software perspective, we announced the planned acquisition of Kodiak Networks and hired Andrew Sinclair, a seasoned software executive, to lead our software efforts. Acquiring the Interexport and Kodiak assets demonstrate our continued commitment towards more recurring software and services revenue.","And finally, we're thrilled to be part of the winning FirstNet team with AT&T. Our investments and innovation in public safety LTE include offerings of mobile applications, services, critically important LMR and LTE interoperability as well as next-generation devices. This FirstNet opportunity further validates our competitive position for both LMR and public safety LTE going forward.","I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Greg. Q1 results include revenue of $1.3 billion, up 7% from last year. Excluding Airwave, revenue grew 3%. GAAP operating earnings of $176 million, up 76% from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $224 million or 17.5% of sales, an increase of 360 basis points from the year-ago quarter. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.45 compared to $0.10 in the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 versus $0.52 in the year-ago quarter, a 37% year-over-year increase.","Ending backlog is up $129 million from last year. Product backlog is up $285 million. Services backlog is down $156 million driven by a $650 million reduction of Airwave backlog over the past 12 months.","For the remainder of the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.","Q1 product sales were $703 million, up $1 million from last year. Q1 Products segment operating income was $101 million or 14.4% of sales, up 240 basis points from last year, driven by improved gross margin and lower OpEx. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, an increase of 22% or $285 million from last year, driven by North America. Sequentially, product backlog increased $38 million, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth.","Q1 Services revenue was $578 million, up 18%. Excluding Airwave, Managed and Support Services, grew 8%. Services operating income was $123 million, up $41 million from the prior year.","Operating margins were 21.3%, an increase of 470 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, down $156 million from last year, driven by $650 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $61 million driven primarily by the acquisition of Interexport.","Moving to operating expenses. Total OpEx was $352 million, a decrease of $3 million from the year-ago quarter. Q1 2017 included an incremental $10 million of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $59 million compared to $42 million last year.","Net interest expense was $51 million compared to $49 million a year ago. The Q1 effective tax rate was 26%.","Q1 operating cash flow was $142 million, an increase of $129 million, driven by higher earnings and a $52 million legal settlement. Free cash flow was $74 million, an increase of $112 million from last year.","We ended Q1 with cash of $829 million and net debt of $3.6 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $178 million of stock at an average price of $80.82, paid $77 million of dividends and invested $55 million of cash in acquisitions.","Turning to our outlook. We expect Q2 sales to be up 2% to 3%, including approximately $25 million of FX headwind, primarily driven by the British pound. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS between $0.98 and $1.03, including $0.05 of Airwave currency headwinds. Inclusive of Q1 results, the first half of 2017 is slightly above our prior expectations.","We now expect full year 2017 sales to be at the high end of our prior range at approximately 2%, and we are raising non GAAP EPS to be in the range of $5.08 to $5.23.","Looking at regional results. America's revenue grew 3% driven by strong demand for services in both North America and Latin America. Backlog is up in both Products and Services versus last year and up sequentially, as customers continue to invest in LMR systems.","EMEA revenue increased 27%, including $58 million of incremental Airwave revenue for the full quarter. Excluding Airwave, EMEA was up 2% with growth in both Products and Services. Asia Pac was flat versus last year, with Australia continuing to be an area of strength for some of our most advanced public safety solutions.","Finally, I'll end with some notable segment highlights. In our product segment, we launched WAVE OnCloud, a new subscription-based SaaS version of our WAVE solution that makes it simple to deploy, maintain and improve workgroup communications. WAVE OnCloud customers can integrate their radio systems with broadband networks, extending their reach to mobile users across various devices and networks.","Additionally, we announced the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, a leading provider of broadband push-to-talk for commercial customers, which adds a carrier-integrated push-to-talk solution for mobile operators around the world.","We also won several notable deals that included an $80 million award from a country in Europe to upgrade and manage its nationwide TETRA network, a $34 million reward to upgrade an existing P25 network in Northern California, and two P25 wins in Argentina totaling $10 million.","In our Services segment, we acquired Interexport, a provider of managed services for communication systems to public safety and commercial users in Chile. Similar to our Airwave business, Interexport helps us deliver on our strategy to drive growth in our Managed and Support Services business. We also grew double digits in our Command Center software business, driven by the demand for our Spillman, Emergency CallWorks and PremierOne solutions.","Finally, building on our Managed Services business in Australia, we signed a significant multi-year managed services contract with the Victoria Police. This contract will allow us to administer a full spectrum of solutions including hardware, software and purpose-built applications on multiple networks.","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Gino, and let me just close with a few brief thoughts.","Q1 was a strong start to the year on both the top and bottom lines. We grew in the Americas and in Europe. We grew organically. We grew earnings, demonstrating our significant operating leverage and we also continue to invest in new services and software that leverage the global installed base of our durable core land mobile radios business.","Second, I'm especially pleased with our public safety LTE position going forward. In addition to being part of the FirstNet award, we've also won all four of the largest global public safety LTE awards to-date. Our commitment and investment to public safety has positioned us well.","And in closing, I'm very pleased with our Q1 performance. I like the strength of our competitive position, and I'm encouraged by our momentum going forward.","I'll now turn the call back over to Chris.","Chris Kutsor - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many participants as possible.","Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Of course. Our first question is coming from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I was intrigued to hear your recent hire of Andrew Sinclair. Now you're talking about your WAVE OnCloud announcement and the Kodiak acquisition. It seems like the next-generation public safety we've been talking about over the last couple of years is becoming more tangible. Could you give us a sense of how big it is today in your business and when we will start seeing material revenues and material composition to growth coming from these new businesses, so interfacing public safety with mobile broadband and software solutions. And I have a quick follow-up on growth in Services.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Well, look, we're especially pleased to hire Andrew from Skype, a seasoned executive. I think it's the next logical step for us as we formulate and shape a more cogent and significant software enterprise.","I think, Pierre, embedded to your question is both software and services, and are pushed toward more recurring revenues in both software and services. Exiting last year, the recurring revenues in software and services were slightly higher than 25%. It would be our desire to finish this year with something north of that. I think you see us continuing to march forward on purposeful software acquisitions, whether it be in the Command Center with Software-as-a-Service with Spillman and Emergency CallWorks, or whether it's on the managed services side, both with Airwave a year ago and now Interexport in Chile. I think we will continue our march forward on more innovation, more software and services centricity and a greater percentage of our revenues over time being more recurring.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, Greg. And quickly on Services. So, in the quarter, year on year, you bagged in about like $30 million of extra Services revenue, if I exceed WAVE (16:04) of course. And I was wondering how much of that was actually contributed by like your recent acquisition, like you mentioned Interexport. And then just wanted to confirm like essentially this growth is coming from managed services contract mostly and not other types of services.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes, Pierre. This is Gino. Managed services did grow year-over-year, as we said, excluding Airwave, up 8%. If we exclude Spillman and Interexport, managed and support services grew 4% in the quarter.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Pierre.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matt Cabral with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Thank you. Just wanted to dig into your guidance for Q2. I guess revenue is up low single-digits year-over-year, but EPS is flat to down a little bit versus last year. So, I'm just curious what's driving the disconnect between the two and how we should think about the cadence of expenses as we go throughout the rest of 2017?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure, Matt. This is Gino. So, in Q2, we mentioned in the prepared comments that part of it is the FX impact year-over-year of Airwave. We also have a project mix within Q2 versus the prior year. The headwinds in gross margin in Q2 are temporary. The Airwave-related FX impact diminishes in Q3 and Q4. And with respect to expenses, we continue to expect OpEx to be down year-over-year. On the last call, we guided to approximately $20 million to $25 million. Now our expectation with the addition of the acquisition OpEx is for OpEx to be down about $10 million to $15 million for the full year.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","So, Matt, in Q2, our 2% to 3% revenue guidance in constant currency is 4% to 5%, and the pound difference on the EPS line is worth $0.05. The last thing I'd just point to is the comment Gino made earlier that even with that, our first half, taking into account Q1 results and our guidance for Q2 today is slightly above the expectations that we had for the first half of the year on the last call.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then just on FirstNet, good to see Motorola officially now part of the contract. Just curious if you can give us a little bit more color on your role there, and just any dimensions of how to think about the size and timing of the opportunity going forward.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Well, first of all, we're thrilled to be on the winning team with AT&T. We've worked with them extensively for the last several quarters, well in excess of a year. I'll remind you that it took a long time. The middle-class jobs relate back (19:29) past five years ago. And I do complement the people at FirstNet and the team and Sue Swenson, because they did a hell of a job in a very complex thing to bring this to award.","We're excited because this opportunity is all incremental to our core business. When we look at what it could include, it could include software and mobile applications. It could include services. I think the most critical piece will be the interoperability with the FirstNet network to interconnect and interoperate with our installed base of land mobile radio systems throughout the U.S. And it could include next-generation devices. We don't have any revenue in 2017. We haven't loaded any in 2018 yet. I think it's a bit too early, and it would be too early to guide or speculate. But we're thrilled to be working with AT&T, and obviously we will work more closely than ever with them going forward.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Kyle (20:43) in for George. I just wanted to dig in on gross margin a little bit further, particularly for the second quarter. I mean, you were higher this quarter, maybe indicating a bit lower for next quarter. I'm wondering if there's any projects that kind of shifted one quarter to the next. And then, I guess, also how much of it is implied to be a mix shift towards Services and other impacts like that? Thanks.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, Colin (21:09). And this is Gino. The first thing we should articulate is that our expectation of gross margin for the year has not changed. And the Q2, as we described it as specific to Q2, there is no underlying trend and no change in expectation for full year margins.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thanks. And I guess one other point on that. I mean, you've had some larger projects over the past two years, LA-RICS, N\u00f8dnett in Norway. I wonder if you could add some color on potential device opportunities into those networks and how that may impact your product segment and margins going forward.","Jack P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Hey, Colin (21:56). It's Jack Molloy. So, with respect to N\u00f8dnett and LA-RICS, we have been obviously selling them devices in an ongoing manner. I will tell you just in general, as we look at North America and rest of world, our device business continue to remain very solid. And I think that's a key point.","We've invested from a go to market perspective in sales analytics. So, we've a real good sense of where legacy equipment is, and we've done a really good job in terms of analytics and getting after our legacy customer base as well as a competitive customer base to move them to APX in terms of ASTRO our next-generation TETRA devices in Europe and Asia.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's worth mentioning too. Molloy and his team had done a good job not only on devices, but in product in general, we mentioned backlog being at a record level. It's also worth noting Product backlog is up again and Product backlog is sitting at the highest level it's been in over four years. So, team executing well in addition to the strong Services growth.","Unknown Speaker","Great. And one last thing for me. With your Interexport acquisition, I'm just wondering how much revenue from that is implied in your guidance for Q2 and full year?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes. This is Gino again, Colin (23:21). The impact of Interexport is approximately $50 million for the full year and the non-GAAP EPS impact is approximately $0.03 for 2017.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Great. That's it from me. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about what's going on in the UK? It sounds like there might have been yet more push-outs to ESN. Could you just talk a little bit about what that means for both that contract as well as the Airwave deal? So, how should we think about the way those two interact and transpire over the next few years? And then I have a follow-up after that.","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure, Tim. This is Bruce Brda. Thanks for the question. Let me start by saying, we continue to hit the deliverables we have for software applications, the build-out at data centers. And in that process, we're leveraging a lot of the expertise in physical assets we acquired with the Airwave acquisition.","As you know, the Public Accounts Committee did a review, actually two reviews, two reports on the Airwave to ESN transition. And following the first report, the transition date, start of transition was moved from September of 2017 to mid-2018. The other piece of news that I would highlight is, Vodafone network that provides core ring connectivity between the cores within the Airwave network is being shutdown. At the end of Q1 2020, we're working with the Home Office to determine if there will be a gap between that time and ESN. And we're confident we can create a solution to provide longevity to the Airwave network for as long as UK Home Office needs it.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you. Then just a follow-up on FirstNet. Greg, could you talk a little bit about still a lot of questions out there about the impact that as the public safety LTE ramps and FirstNet ramps, the impact that'll have on the LMR business in the U.S. Could you just talk a little bit about the areas where you think it's fully additive and the areas where there might be some cannibalization risk, particularly on the device side? Thank you.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I think I view FirstNet as additive period for quite a long time. It's a data and video network for interoperable broadband that will interface with our narrowband mission-critical communications voice network. I think the big differences between a private network and a cellular network are things around coverage and capacity, cost and coverage. There's hardened encryption. There's so many different things that go into making a private, always on, reliable, secure, purpose-built network along with the devices that are very unique for the value proposition of public safety versus a FirstNet or a cellular type network.","I think on devices, I see a scenario where people will wear two devices on their belt, a mission-critical communications radio and a next-generation device. We're well positioned to do that. To the extent, to your point, that may evolve over time because today every first responder in the U.S. or just about everyone, police officer, and they have two devices today. They have a radio for mission-critical communications voice and they have a smartphone over a carrier network that provisions 4G broadband today.","We see that scenario replicating, in which case, that second new device is greenfield opportunity for us. If those devices merge over time and at some point in the future, we're better positioned than anybody given the domain expertise, the latency and the demand requirements around public safety to provide the integrated device. But if that happens, I see that is a long way off. So, FirstNet we see as purely incremental, Tim.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Good luck the next two days guys.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I just want to make sure I kind of understand all the puts and takes in this year. So, if I think about the guidance of up 2% that's about $120 million year-over-year. Spillman adds $50 million, Interexport adds $50 million, Airwave adds a bit. There's probably some foreign currency around the margins. So, generally kind of flattish organically. Am I missing any kind of big picture items there in that analysis?","Secondly, is Kodiak in the guidance right now? And can you talk about the materiality or lack thereof of Kodiak?","And then Gino, I forget if you gave a free cash flow guidance for the year. Obviously, Q1 was up significantly year-over-year. Maybe talk about what you expect for free cash flow in Q2 or for the full year. Thanks.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","So, Tavis, as it relates to Kodiak, it's not contemplated in the guidance. Having said that, we expect it to close Q3, Q4 and it is immaterial either way in its revenue contribution this year. I think the approximately 2% annual revenue guidance that we're providing I would consider measured and prudent. We still expect organic growth for the full year, but it's very important for us to continue the drumbeat of meet or beat quarter after quarter. So, I think that's incorporated into the full year guidance outlook.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","And Tavis, with respect to operating cash flow, the guidance for the full year was approximately $1.225 billion. We continue to expect that to be our operating cash flow number for the full year. We don't give forward guidance on the quarters as that moves around a little bit, but we continue to expect $1.225 billion for the full year.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And a quick follow-up, Greg, I feel like I have a good sense of what's driving Services backlog, but on Product backlog, is that primarily infrastructure or devices or both? And what types of contracts do you end up generating meaningful Product backlog from?","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I think the product backlog is primarily driven by devices. We've had one of our best quarters ever. In fact, I think it was our largest device quarter ever in Q4 of 2016. So, the execution by Molloy's team worldwide on devices remain strong.","Having said that, it's worth noting that networks and systems provide the catalyst for driving multi-year managed and support services growth for the long-term. So, I think our device execution has been strong. But as we sell more networks, that's really the catalyst and the foundational bedrock to provide multi-year managed and support services growth as well, and I think the team is doing a good job on both right now.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Right. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Question for you regarding FirstNet, if you could drill down a little bit further. So, do we think about the services that Motorola provide at FirstNet would be similar to what Alliance was doing for the ESN?","Jack P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","In terms of the content that we could provide, I think it would be similar, software and applications and some services as well. I would also point out, as Greg mentioned earlier, interoperability between LTE and LMR is a major opportunity that is in place in the UK and we would expect to be in place in North America as well. On top of that, devices would be another area that we would expect to enjoy some business as FirstNet gets up and rolling.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","So, you guys are saying, cool. (33:10) Is it because the contracts haven't been defined yet exactly in terms of what exactly are we doing?","Jack P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I think we're continuing to work closely with AT&T, and quite frankly, we're finalizing the individual buckets and the opportunities around each one.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. Got it. And then like AT&T are talking about opening up their bands to the agencies as soon as the states choose to opt in or opt out, or actually to opt in, obviously. I imagine that's not going to be a criteria for you but (33:40) point, it's more when the network's ready, years down the road, correct?","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I'm not sure if I understood the question. We can provide content independent of the band that the carrier makes available to public safety. I'm not sure if I answered your question, Keith.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Well, they're talking about, if state opts in by the end of the year that agencies will start using their services immediately. But to me, I understand it to be separate from when the FirstNet network is up and ready. Are these distinct events?","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","So, when the service is launched, AT&T will not have deployed Band Class 14. And they can put to use all of their consumer bands that exist today. Later, and over time, they'll build out Band Class 14 nationwide and then that band will additionally be used by public safety, additionally and primarily used by public safety, but they will have the ability to offer all bands available today to public safety as soon as the FirstNet service is launched.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Stanley Kovler with Citi Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask a little bit more on M&A. Could you help us understand how you're prioritizing and thinking about cash return versus M&A outside of the large acquisition that you made last year? It seems like there's been a concerted effort on some software services types of deals. Can we expect may be an acceleration of that going forward?","And then on the most recent one that you did, Kodiak, they've worked quite a bit with AT&T on push-to-talk over cellular. So, how does it fit into your WAVE portfolio? And how should we think about that segment of the business evolving? Thanks.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","From a Kodiak perspective, we've actually been thinking about this and working on it for a long period of time. Quite frankly, with having nothing to do and out of the context of FirstNet. WAVE is our current lead solution for broadband push-to-talk. Kodiak gives us a carrier-integrated, carrier-centric solution for push-to-talk over cellular for commercial customers.","Your other question was around, what was it again?","Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","M&A.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","M&A, I don't think anything has changed. We continue to march forward with the prioritization around software and services as we've talked about, Command Center software, managed and support services, things and areas that reinforce our platform and solution orientation. Our capital allocation framework hasn't changed.","So, I think we talked about 600 million for the full year being fungible and available for either share repurchase or M&A that we found attractive or accretive. I don't think that's changed. We did purchase $178 million of shares in Q1 at a price of 80, 82 (36:39) because we thought that was the sound use of capital. So, I think we continually think in terms of capital return to the shareholder as well as M&A, and we'll look to optimize that every quarter going forward.","Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And if I can just follow-up on your Product revenue growth. Last quarter, in December, you had a very significant increase in Product revenue growth year-over-year. How should we think about the growth in Products for the balance of 2017 and what the outlook is there? Thank you.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","So, there is really no change in our outlook for 2017. Again, strong backlog, strong order performance in Q1, and very solid aging for the remainder of the year versus last year. Q1 was relatively flat in Products, following Q4 at 9% growth. So, we continue to see healthy demand across all our Product categories, and really confirms the durability and longevity of LMR. That, in addition with our Services backlog, multiple year 10 to 15-year service contracts again confirm the durability of LMR.","Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Ashwin filling in for Rod. I guess my first question is for Greg. I was wondering if you could comment on the visibility in the U.S. fiber business here. It appears like engagement levels are strong there. Can you comment on the level of visibility and any update on your U.S. growth expectations?","And my next question is on, going back to the discussion around FirstNet, it sounds like AT&T is signaling that they could start some network deployments by the end of this year maybe ramp up next year. So, when we think about opportunity for MSI, what potential lack could MSI see in some of the revenues flowing through?","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of the second one first, I mean I don't want to speak for AT&T, they're the prime contractor. They'll take the lead and the pace and scope that they end up rolling out and delivering is really their decision working with the individual states. As I mentioned, we don't expect anything this year. Nothing is built into next year at the moment. I think it's steady as she goes and we have to evaluate all the activities and what ultimately happens and gets decided between now and the end of the year, how that maps into activity for 2018.","In terms of visibility, our aged backlog is higher at this point for the balance of the year than it was a year ago. I think that we've got pretty good visibility into the business. We worked with a six-quarter rolling forecast with Jack Molloy and all the field general managers. As it relates to demand in the U.S., the Americas in Q1 grew 3%. North America was 2% of that. If you were to dimensionalize the U.S. Federal business as a segment within North America, we expect it to be comparable this year over last year about $500 million, but I think the business is performing in a more balanced way, and we grew in every region in Q1. Asia Pac was flat, but we have growth in the others and it is conceivable all feeders can grow for the balance of 2017. So it's more balanced, and that's embedded in the guidance we provided.","Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And Gino, I guess, could you comment on the integration services a little bit? Looks like it did end this quarter. Any comments there?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","On integration services specifically or managed...","Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, integration services.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","...and support services. Really no comment on integration services. That matches infrastructure deployments, and it kind of goes along with infrastructure deployments but no specific comments on integration services. Clearly, we're very pleased with the continued performance in managed and support services, continuing to grow mid-single digits recurring revenue, but no real commentary. Nothing really to comment on in Q1 with respect to systems integration.","Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. This is Brian on for Vijay. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe circling back to the question earlier. Could you maybe provide us some first-person demand color on the government end markets? So, maybe what you're hearing from your sales force or IT organizations at like the federal, state, local level in terms of purchasing trends for the rest of this year?","Jack P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Okay. Sure, Brian. Hi, it's Jack. I think we'll start with just to kind of reiterate, Greg just talked about, first of all, I'll start with the federal government. I would say, first of all, as he said it's comparable to 2016, but there are some things that we're hearing from our sales team that could be beneficial. Namely, the supplemental budget that's in play right now includes additional funding for both border security and defense. So, as we think about those from a demand driver, we think that could be beneficial here as we work our way through 2017.","From a state and local perspective, Brian, we've been really pleased with the performance. Really going back to 2015, the performance has been strong. State and local budgets, particularly as they apply to public safety, and that's important because there's a stickiness to public safety funding given the crime patterns that we see throughout the U.S. right now, they remain solid. Spoke to it earlier, device business remains solid as well as infrastructure. And I think the important thing there is, infrastructure as well as the managed and support services that those sales drive. So that's also been good.","The third element, and Greg made reference to it last quarter, is the commercial markets. So, we've increased our hiring of sales head count effective, really early 2015 and that's starting to obviously yield dividends for us and think about that in terms of the utility marketplace, oil and gas marketplace, and most recently we've made incremental hires in terms of transportation logistics and manufacturing. And we've seen both of those markets in the U.S. start to yield PCR like system sales for us. So, all in, if we think about those three elements in North America, the demand drivers look very positive for us.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Greg, I was hoping you could start by talking a little bit about the sources of funding in budgets that are out there for LMR and if you think those same budgets and same sources of funding will be allocated to FirstNet, any risk that they're competing with one another for the same budget dollars? And then I have a follow-up.","Jack P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Hey, Ben. It's Jack. I'll take a swing at this. So, first of all, when you think about state and local budgets and that's really what we're talking about as we start to look to FirstNet, there's two separate funding budgets actually. Typically with state and local with the systems and the devices, those are public safety operational budgets that would be kind of more deemed to be traditionally CapEx budgets, meaning every year they've got a certain amount that they buy radios with. It's not unlike that they have funding to buy Ford Explorers or anything different.","Now if you take a side piece of that, really over the course of the last 5 to 6, maybe 10 years, we've seen funding that's actually gone to fund the operational expense of data devices, and that's really the funding that'll start to come in play. And by the way, it hasn't been just AT&T. So, really AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and to a smaller extent, T-Mobile, have really competed for that operational expense budget, the cell phone type data devices. Historically, used to be BlackBerries now moving to more iPhone, Android type devices. That budget's resident today. So, I think that budget will be what people look to move on in terms of FirstNet and getting data subscribers.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And the other question is, I know you hear this a lot, but how do you think about the timing and the issues that need to be resolved for mission-critical voice over LTE to be a realistic displacement risk to LMR at some point in time? Could you talk to what issues have to be resolved, and if you have any thoughts on the timing of when it could be a realistic threat to LMR?","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure. This is Bruce Brda. First of all, push-to-talk over cellular has been around for a long time and you can even go back two decades with Nextel. But with LTE-based service, the capacity has been out there in the network for four, five, six years with most carriers. There are a number of issues, though, with respect to the standards that need to continue to be enhanced to provide true mission-critical support for public safety. One that I would point out is direct mode operation. In most public safety environments at a incident scene, public safety will often switch to a direct mode operation. That doesn't exist in the LTE standards today.","So, as one example, that would need to be solved and that needs to go through standards and then ripple through the ecosystem being built into chips, being built into products and then deployed into the market. So there's quite a long process that needs to take place before you could ever get to true mission-critical public safety grade LTE for push-to-talk services.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Spinola with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Bruce, if I could follow up on that response. Are there other ways to solve the direct mode issue than having to do it through the standards? Is it possible to carry repeaters in cars or certain other ways to solve that problem?","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Not that have been investigated in the standards process to-date. One way that has been discussed is actually to carry two devices LMR to provide the direct mode but that doesn't really meet the objective of a replacement. It means you're going to continue to use two devices. But we participate in the standards in every aspect of the 3GPP standards especially around mission-critical operation and we're not aware of a great solution for this that will be available in the foreseeable future.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Right. I guess what happens to the UK emergency services network? I mean they obviously would have looked at this issue. They have an initial timeframe of end of 2019 to be in service. You mentioned not having mission-critical push-to-talk available, but they're planning on being in production at that point. So, where is the disconnect there?","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I think, Andrew, that's a better question for the customer than for us. Obviously, we provide Airwave today for the 300,000-plus first responders there with 99% coverage. ESN recently, as Bruce mentioned, was delayed nine months. They continue to work through their own targets, their own issues, and quite frankly, their own internal discussions around timing and feature functionality.","In parallel to that, we're meeting all the application requirements and deliverable requirements around what's required for Motorola Solutions to deliver for ESN. So that's really up to them. We're providing Airwave. In parallel, we're meeting the milestones and deliverables for ESN. Ultimately, what they decide and when and how to deploy which or optimize whatever mix, we stand ready to serve them in whatever they determine, but that's their call.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. I appreciate the color. One quick follow-up. Was there any acquisition revenue from the Q3, Q4 acquisitions that were in the Product segment in Q1?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","De minimis, Andrew. Very, very little.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Primarily Services.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew DeGasperi with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew DeGasperi - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. I know most of the questions were answered, but I just had a quick one. On the litigation, just wanted to know if there's any sort of impact to your EPS as far as costs as that ramps up? And then, secondly, maybe can you let us know what your exposure to China is these days? Thanks.","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Well, in the HYT litigation, first of all, it's important to say that we're very confident in our case. We take really seriously the protection of our IP and protection of both the cost and the efforts around our innovation. And quite frankly, the HYT case is pretty compelling and reflects their systematic, egregious and illegal behavior. I'm especially pleased that the ITC formally launched their investigation at the end of April into HYT's unfair trade practices. We think that's appropriate. So, very confident on the merits of our position against that litigation. Yes, there's some incremental cost, but that's incorporated into both the Q2 and full year guidance that we've provided.","Andrew DeGasperi - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And on China?","Greg Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","China, I think, we expect our revenues in 2017 to be down against full China revenues in 2016, and we'll continue to manage that accordingly. China is about 3% of our revenue. And China has demonstrated a consistent and increasing preference for indigenous providers, which changes the landscape and continues to change the landscape there for us. But I think we've thought about it and we anticipate declining revenue from China that's built into our outlook.","Andrew DeGasperi - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Understood.

Brown","Thanks, Shep. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Solid results in Q2 Government helped to succeed our earnings outlook, while our Enterprise business declined, resulting in overall sales at the lower end of our outlook. As I think about the quarter, there are 4 key messages: First, weakness in Enterprise continued; second, our Government business remained strong over record results last year; third, we're still targeting 18% operating margin for the full year; and finally, our overall confidence in these businesses is reflected by our announcement today of a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, along with a 19% increase in our dividend.","In Enterprise, we expected improvement this quarter, but that didn't happen. While we continue to have positive dialogue with customers, along with additional user trials for our expansion products, we still have yet to see a meaningful pickup in sales conversion and large Enterprise deals. This demand environment we face in Enterprise is not unique to us, as the broader industry is impacted by customers carefully managing their IT budgets in the face of macro uncertainty.","As a result of this environment, we now expect a more modest recovery in this business toward the latter part of the year. Having said that, strategically, our Enterprise business remains well positioned to capture a rebound in Enterprise spending as that occurs. In light of this elongated recovery in Enterprise, we now expect full year sales growth for the total company of approximately flat to up 1%.","The Government business continues to perform well, especially when you consider the record revenue and profitability levels from last year. Backlog in Government remains healthy. And both ASTRO and TETRA had solid growth in infrastructures sales, which is typically a leading indicator for future subscriber demand. This business continues to demonstrate its resilient characteristics where incumbency, innovation, support for future migrations and legacy compatibility are important differentiators for Motorola. Our 18% operating margin target for 2013 is unchanged, although clearly our path to achieving it is now primarily driven by Government and proactively taking costs out to offset our lower growth expectations.","I'll now turn the call over to Ed to provide additional details on our Q2 results. And then I'll return to discuss the quarter a little bit further.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Thanks, Greg. Q2 sales declined 2%. Q2 Government sales were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 1% from the prior year quarter. Operating margins in the Government segment improved 120 basis points from 16.4% to 17.6%. Better gross margins due to mix and lower general and administrative costs led to the improvement in profitability.","Enterprise revenues declined 5% to $656 million. Excluding the impact of Psion and iDEN, Q2 revenues declined 9%. Operating margins in the Enterprise business declined from 16% to 11.9%. Lower product sales volume, the addition of Psion and the decline in iDEN drove this margin decrease.","Operating expenses were $709 million or 33.7% of revenue, which is flat from the year-ago quarter. We will continue to actively manage our cost structure and invest appropriately based on our business needs, which will include modulating spending in a way that factors in the macro and Enterprise environment.","Our operating earnings for the second quarter were $334 million or 15.9% of sales, compared to $350 million or 16.3% in Q2 2012. Total other income and expense was a net expense of $42 million in the quarter, compared to a net expense of $38 million in Q2 2012. We expect this line item to be an expense of approximately $40 million per quarter going forward.","Our effective tax rate was negative for the quarter, driven by $118 million of net tax benefits largely as a result of our new international holding company structure, which represents the year-to-date amount of the full year tax benefit. Based on current outlook -- based on our current outlook, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 13% in Q3 and Q4. After 2013, we expect our ongoing effective tax rate to return to approximately 32% to 33%.","Cash generated by operating activities from continuing operations for second quarter was $82 million, as compared to $254 million of cash generated in the second quarter of 2012. Lower cash flow results for the quarter were primarily driven by lower sales and linearity of sales within the quarter. Specifically, we had higher sales in June than the year-ago period, which drove lower AR collections. Lower accounts payable days also contributed to the decline year-over-year. For the full year, we now see risk of up to $150 million to our operating cash flow while compared to last year. This is primarily due to 3 items: First, a lower sales -- lower full year sales outlook; second, $43 million held by the India government, which relates to tax amounts currently under dispute; and third, $25 million to $30 million of incremental restructuring-related actions as we adjust our cost structure to match our lower growth profile. Let me also remind you that as we compare our cash flows with prior year levels, that we expect to pay an incremental $150 million in withholding and other taxes in 2013. These tax payments are aligned with our international holding company strategy that we announced at our Analyst Day in May.","We ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash and $2.5 billion in debt. With respect to capital return, we repurchased $550 million of stock or 9.5 million shares, at an average price of $57.80 per share. Since we began repurchasing shares in Q3 of 2011, we have bought back $4.5 billion, or 92 million shares, at an average price of $48.62. In addition, we paid $71 million in dividends during the quarter.","We remain committed to capital return as part of our capital allocation framework. This morning, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per share, which represents a 19% increase over the prior quarterly dividend. We also announced that our board has authorized an increase of $2 billion to our share repurchase program.","Now turning to our Q3 and full year outlook. For Q3, we expect sales to be flat to down 3% compared to the third quarter of 2012. Our Q3 outlook is for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.97 to $1.02 from continuing operations based on Q2 ending share count, and this incorporates the new effective tax rate of 10% to 13%. This compares to non-GAAP EPS in Q3 2012 of $0.84 per share.","Moving to full year 2013, we now expect sales to be flat to up 1%. We expect Government to grow low-single digits and we now expect a low single-digit decline in Enterprise. In addition, we previously expected favorability from foreign exchange tailwinds in the second half of 2013 based on a more favorable euro rate. However, we have seen significant weakening of the Australian dollar and Japanese yen, as well as weakness in the British pound and now expect an unfavorable FX impact of approximately $30 million in the second half revenues. We remain focused on driving operating leverage and still plan for full year operating margins of approximately 18%.","And now I'll turn it over to Greg for business highlights from the quarter.","Gregory Q. Brown","Thanks, Ed. As previously stated, Government sales for the quarter declined $8 million from Q2 2012, or 1%. Profitability for the business increased with operating earnings of 17.6% of sales compared to 16.4% in Q2 of last year. In our ASTRO portfolio, total sales declined single digits off of last year's comparable record 20% growth rate. Having said that, new infrastructure -- new system infrastructure sales actually increased over Q2 last year. We had a number of new wins during the quarter, including an $88 million contract with Maricopa County, Arizona to implement a digital radio communications network with coverage across the county. The Phase 2 TDMA network will replace a 15-year-old system and increase capacity with the available spectrum.","We also received a $20 million order from the City of Phoenix Regional Wireless Cooperative to upgrade their 13-year-old ASTRO system that serves the interoperable communications needs of first responders and other municipal users in 19 cities, towns and fire districts.","In Canada, we were awarded a $28 million contract with the York Region in Toronto to replace a 20-year-old system and another with the City of Qu\u00e9bec for $10 million. And Carroll County, Maryland awarded us a contact for a $12 million system upgrade.","The P25 standard and our ASTRO portfolio continue to extend beyond North America into over 60 countries. For example, the Taiwan Coast Guard selected us for a $10 million ASTRO system, and the Kuwait Ministry of Defense awarded us a $17 million contract for an upgrade to ASTRO 7.14, our newest infrastructure product scheduled for Q4 release. This latest version of our ASTRO system includes enhanced mission-critical redundancy and a seamless migration path that can be performed with no system downtime. The system architecture is also designed for improved serviceability and scalability, including future LTE upgrades.","Mission-critical users expect technology that must be intuitive to use, easy to deploy, interoperable with legacy systems and future-proof. And we continue to innovate around these requirements while tailoring our portfolio for adjacent verticals. For example, Entergy, a large utility in the South is investing in a $44 million ASTRO 25 Phase 2 TDMA network to replace their legacy analog platform. The new system consists of APX radios and dispatch consoles for daily requirements, as well as communications during storm restoration.","And the Imperial Irrigation District in the California desert, a community-owned electric and water utility, recently chose us for their ASTRO system. The Port of Seattle's $4 million investment in an ASTRO system this quarter is another example of our radio systems used to secure medical, mission-critical infrastructure.","Our TETRA portfolio grew strong double digits in total, driven by new systems and installation. We had several notable wins in TETRA during the quarter as well. In Singapore, the Ministry of Home Affairs recently awarded a contract for a Next Generation Nationwide Network and selected our latest broadband-ready TETRA digital radio technology. The initial phase of the award is valued at $79 million for us and our local consortium partner to deploy the nationwide network, which will serve the police and Singapore Civil Defence Force with a total of 42,000 officers.","Other TETRA awards include Entropia Digital, a Dutch network operator serving commercial users such as transportation, utilities and power generation industries, and we had continued success in the rail transportation market, with large awards from Shatin Central rail in Hong Kong for $15 million and Taiwan High Speed Rail for $8 million.","At Critical Communications World in Paris, we introduced our next generation of TETRA infrastructure, including the first combined TETRA and LTE base station. This innovative solution is designed to facilitate a cost-effective and staged migration to a unified TETRA and LTE network. It equips network operators for future needs and gives them flexibility to choose when and where to add LTE to their core networks and on which frequency.","Our professional and commercial radio sales were down slightly compared to Q2 2012, where we had record double-digit growth. We continue to tier our PCR portfolio around the digital platform. Several years ago, we were the first introduce a digital radio in the professional market and today our MOTOTRBO is the most widely deployed adopted digital platform, with more than 2,000 systems deployed and 2 million units sold globally.","We're extending MOTOTRBO and bringing benefits of digital, such as better capacity, coverage and voice quality, to additional tiers as well. This expanded MOTOTRBO lineup will bring digital features to an existing install base that is still about 90% analog today. In terms of new contract awards for PCR, we've seen continued rollout across multiple production facilities in North America for Chrysler utilizing MOTOTRBO, and General Mills is also deploying it for their on-site communications. We continue to invest in applications and control points that are important tools for public safety, like the command center. We released our PremierOne Next Generation 9-1-1 Call Control solution designed to transform incident management operations by integrating CAD and 9-1-1 systems, eliminating data entry for dispatchers during emergency calls and improving their focus and productivity.","Another area where public safety is incorporating more technology is in the police vehicle as an integrated communications hub. We recently made a very small but strategic acquisition of 54ward Integrated Solutions, a provider of software and hardware interface components that connect in-vehicle public safety equipment, including radio, light and siren, radar, license place recognition and mobile computing. And our Real-Time Crime Center solution was featured at the recent annual Conference of Mayors in Las Vegas, where their Technology and Innovation Task Force explored the topic of using data and analytics to fight crime. Finally, wrapping up our Government results for the quarter, the business continues to perform well and the demand drivers of an aged legacy infrastructure and its corresponding need for upgrades continue.","Now moving on to the Enterprise segment. Sales in Enterprise were $656 million, a decrease of 5% from Q2 of last year. Operating earnings declined to 11.9% of sales from 16% last year, driven by negative leverage from lower sales, Psion sales and lower iDEN revenues. Enterprise sales results were driven by double-digit declines in the enterprise mobile computing portfolio, excluding iDEN, an expected iDEN decline of $31 million, a mid-single-digit decline in data capture and a mid-single-digit decline in WLAN.","Our uniqueness in Enterprise is characterized by designing technology around the specific user experiences, whether it's for a truck driver at a logistics company or a manager or customer in a retail store. Integration with legacy applications is also vital for our customers, many of whom have millions of dollars in back-office investments that they intend to leverage. A great example of this is our work that we're doing with Tesco. They continue to rollout our MC17 devices with a $3 million order to expand their scan-as-you-shop program across large-format stores in the U.K.","The MC17 also supports their dotcom program, which enables shoppers to have groceries delivered to their door. Tesco is piloting our new SB1 Smart Badge and mobile workforce management software with their customer service teams to improve in-store communication and customer response times.","One area of strength for Enterprise this quarter was in Asia Pac, Middle East, where the business grew double digits. We had several new wins in the region, with retailers like Coles Supermarkets for $3 million, Kmart Australia for $2 million. And our new value tier MC2100 positioned us well to win a $3 million award for China Post, and a $1 million order for Deppon Logistics in China. And Australia Post continued their deployment of our MC67 devices with another $5 million order.","We've also updated several of our industrial mobile computing products. We recently introduced the MC9200, an expansion to the world's most popular industrial mobile computing product, with more than 2 million devices shipped over the last decade. We also released a new imaging device built on the legacy of our most popular scanner. This next-generation linear imager expands our portfolio to provide another option for retailers looking to read both printed 1D bar codes and electronic bar codes displayed on mobile device screens, a common application for loyalty cards and mobile coupons. We've seen encourage -- encouraging early demand indicators from the channel for this specific product.","Two new Psion products are designed for use in cold temperatures, freezers and cold storage environments, which are common in perishable food and medical industries, present some of the most extreme specs for computing hardware. United States Cold Storage recently chose these devices for their requirements.","With respect to some of our new expansion products, we've engaged with numerous customer pilots. We remain enthusiastic about the opportunity associated with these products, but the rate of sales conversion has taken longer than we initially anticipated. The Android-based MC40 multifunction device that's designed for inventory management, as well as point-of-sale and voice, had several pilot deployments among major retailers in Europe and North America, while the SB1 is deployed at a major shoe retailer at 130 locations in North America and a pharmacy chain with several locations here in the U.S. We won a $7 million project with Canadian Tire to deploy more than 5,000 of our devices in their stores as a digital hub for an improved customer shopping experience as well.","Moving on to the regional results this quarter for the total company. With respect to the Americas, North America sales declined 1% with continued strength in Government, up single digits, while the Enterprise business declined high-single digits in North America. Following a terrific quarter in Q1, Latin America was down 24%, off of a tough compare last year where Government actually grew over 40%. Large deals can drive quarterly variability in this region based on its relative small size. However, we remain confident in the double-digit growth outlook for the full year for Latin America, excluding iDEN.","Turning to Europe and Africa, we grew 4%, driven by single-digit growth in both Government and Enterprise. Excluding Psion, the Enterprise business declined double digits. And finally, in Asia Pac and Middle East, sales declined 2%, with a high-single-digit decline in Government and double-digit growth in Enterprise. Sales in China were up double digits. These regional results were consistent with our Q2 expectations as we make progress at returning this region to growth for the full year.","I made 2 trips during the quarter to this region, meeting with customers and government officials and our new leadership team, and I'm encouraged about our continued gaining momentum in that area.","Our Services line of business grew single digits in Q2. We renewed several significant support agreements for systems, including the East Bay Regional Communications System for $8 million, and a $10 million maintenance agreement with the state of Mississippi for their statewide system that currently provides mission-critical communications to over 17,000 public safety users.","Within our Managed Services business, the South Australian Government Radio Network extended their managed network service contract, and U.K. Mail continued to adopt our Mobility Lifecycle Management solution to help monitor, manage and improve the availability of devices deployed across their 52 sites and 2,500 vehicles. This comprehensive solution includes our Enterprise mobile computing devices, combined with life cycle management, enabling the customer to utilize the latest in mobile technology while maintaining a focus on their customers and strategic business objectives.","In terms of specific milestones, we continue to implement the Norway contract, with over 200 live sites and best-in-class system availability metrics, since we acquired the prime responsibility in Q1 of 2012.","So let me share with you a few closing thoughts as I wrap up our prepared comments on this call. First, I'm proud of our team's ability to execute and meet our Q2 expectations despite record comps in Government last year and a challenging industry environment in Enterprise. Second, we remain committed to innovation and leadership in both our Government and Enterprise business, as we know this is the best way to generate returns for our shareholders over the long term. Third, while there are factors impacting our Enterprise business that we don't control, we're going to work hard on managing the things that we can. And we will be rigorous in driving profitability across the entire company and remain committed to our 18% operating margin target. And fourth, our confidence in our business and our commitment to shareholder return remain strong, as evidenced by today's announcement for a 19% dividend increase and a $2 billion increase in the share repurchase authorization.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Kulbinder Garcha, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First of all, Greg, I guess and Ed, for you, in terms of the guidance, the implied fourth quarter -- toward fourth quarter ramp in sales and operating income is very high. You obviously play with the ranges, but it looks like you're implying that sales would grow maybe 20% quarter-on-quarter, the operating margins would scale to being well over 21%. I know there's those various scenarios that get you to that very high number in Q4, but can you maybe explain what gives you the confidence of that ramp today in terms of order book visibility, customer conversation. However you want to frame that discussion, that would be helpful.","And the second question is, I guess for Greg, and I mean this with the greatest respect, forecasting of the Enterprise business has proved very challenging. So can you speak about what you've done now in this new guidance to give us the confidence that we're not going to be here in 3 months' time and maybe that Q4 number gets pulled down?","Gregory Q. Brown","Kulbinder, that's a fair question. I'll take the second part first. At the end of the day, we're disappointed in the performance of the Enterprise business and what we now see is a few things. First, an elongated spending recovery. Second, quite frankly, and we have detailed conversations and engagements with customers, but the conversion of some of these critical engagements are taking longer. In addition to that, I think many customers are taking what we thought would be larger purchases and breaking them into smaller chunks. And quite frankly, and Mark Moon maybe can reference this later in the call as well, we had a number of customers where we still have very good visibility to a deal, and we still believe that we're more likely to win the deal, but not only, Kulbinder, has it slipped out of the quarter, because of tight CapEx spending, some of these customers have deferred until early 2014. And quite frankly, we didn't anticipate that.","On the new product side, we still have good engagement on the SB1 and the MC40, the biplane scanner, but quite frankly, some of those are converting to more pilots and trials as opposed to projects and deployments. And then lastly, as Ed referenced in his comments, what we had thought would be FX tailwinds for the second half are now FX or foreign exchange headwinds. So we've taken those into account as we've more thoughtfully guided the second half of the year. And that's where we are.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","So on the sales by quarter, the 20%, we could talk to you offline, but the mathematics, it more implies a mid-single digit or a little bit higher, on a comprehensive basis or across both those businesses. Mark can talk to them, but one of the key items, if you look at the biggest business, Government, as we look into the future and we look at our backlog and the aged backlog that we're seeing at this point in time of the year versus this point in time of the year last year, it's up significantly. It's up, I think, over $100 million versus where we were last year, so the confidence in having visibility into the fourth quarter for Government. And as Greg just mentioned, the Enterprise opportunities are still there. We weren't forecasting growth in Enterprise based upon just a general macroeconomic improvement. It was based upon real deals that, as Greg mentioned, pushed out, some of them into Q4, as you mentioned. So we are planning for growth in both Government and Enterprise in Q4, but some of those deals did push out into 2014 and that was the rationale for the guidance coming down. I'll let Mark add any more color there.","Mark F. Moon","I think the details to what Ed just said in total mathematics are correct. If you break it down by segment, if you think about the Enterprise business in fourth quarter and really for the second half in general, it's really -- we're only anticipating normal linearity from first half to second half, I would remind you, coming off of a soft first half. So while it looks to big, it's really normal growth adjusted for normal seasonality, with a bottom's up build. I would also remind you that Q3 and Q4 of the previous year was actually down 10% in each of those quarters without Psion and without iDEN. So we're coming off of a weaker compare as we talk about those particular quarters.","In Government, Government is a stronger Q4 and it really is just the loading of projects. When you look at that from a Government perspective, we definitely have been resilient all throughout, as Greg mentioned in his earlier comments. But Q4 in particular has strong aged backlog already. We have good visibility to Q4. In fact, as we entered Q3, we had similar types of backlog already aged into Q4, which we expect to build throughout the quarter. We also have good funnel visibility to the projects that are actually going to happen. And as Greg mentioned in his comment, a major ASTRO infrastructure release, 7.14, which will be our newest infrastructure release, will occur within the quarter. So we really do have good visibility to what we're forecasting for second half and fourth quarter.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","So Kulbinder, just one added piece of detail. As you look at it and we look at the ranges of the guidance, if we're at the left side of the range, the down 3%, you'd need to do 7% to get to the right side of the guidance of 1% growth for the full year. If we go flat for the full year and we're down at 3%, we need to grow 2.7% in Q4. So that's how it all kind of comports as we do the mathematics.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Spinola, Wells Fargo.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just looking at the different pieces of the Government business. You had said TETRA was up double digits for the year. P25, I think it sounds like, was a little soft. But infrastructure, on the whole, was up for the year. When I think about those data points together, I'm wondering, especially when I compare 2013 with 2012 in your Government business, maybe, and the infrastructure being up, is the weakness in the handhelds maybe bigger because of the narrowbanding mandate in 2012? Do you think that maybe more demand was pulled into '12 than you originally thought? And any color there. And I have a follow-up on the PCR business.","Mark F. Moon","So I think in particular, the narrowbanding in North America did have an impact, as we talked about throughout the year, on all of our portfolio, but particularly on the subscriber base. I would describe the subscriber performance for this year as not really being weak, but really coming off of a very strong compare. And as Greg mentioned, we are excited about the infrastructure growth that's still continuing to go, which usually is a indicator for future subscriber add-ons. So all in all, I think your analysis around the narrowbanding in North America, as well as the first push around analog to digital around the world, led to some good strong subscriber sales last year, and we're banging up against that comparable as we look at subscribers sales for this year.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then on the decline in PCR, could you maybe break down a little bit where you are seeing the softness? Is it in your Government customers or Enterprise customers, and maybe what's driving that?","Mark F. Moon","Again, as you think about last year, very strong year for our PCR business, both narrowbanding driven, very similar to the comment you just made on ASTRO, as well as conversion from analog to digital around the world. So as you look at those comparables both ways, the comment I just made earlier, our subscribers are flat year-on-year. And we really expect PCR to be roughly flat year-on-year, so we're still seeing good demand. I think it is coming against the tough comparable that we had the previous year. So we don't really see any fundamental drivers changing in either of those businesses.","Gregory Q. Brown","The only thing I'd add is we saw PCR dip slightly, a little bit in Asia. And I would attribute that primarily due to some factors in Japan. And we are refreshing and tiering some new subscriber PCR products that will begin to be rolled out later this year that I think will improve that individual regional situation.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tavis McCourt, Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Ed, a couple of clarifications for you, then a big picture one for Greg. In terms of your comments on operating cash flow, can you kind of refresh us of either what the original operating cash flow guidance was for the year, or what we should be thinking about now? And then also on tax rate, I think you mentioned 10% to 13%. Is that the effective tax rate we should expect for Q3 and Q4 or for the full year on an average basis?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Okay, so on cash flow, let me refresh. We had talked about, and what we mentioned at the Financial Analyst Meeting, in general, our model will be to grow operating cash flow in line with net income. At the Analyst Meeting, we had talked about, given the softness in the top line where we work it at -- we took it down from 5% down to previously to the 4% -- 3% to 4%. We had talked about getting cash flow relatively flat year-over-year. That was even with the $150 million of tax payments that we're making aligned with our strategy, our international holdco strategy to reduce ongoing taxes. At this point, given the continued softness in sales, the biggest contributor for the full year will be the lower level of sales that we now expect. With that, we now see $150 million of risk to the full year driven by that top line softness. Second, we had mentioned $43 million of taxes that were seized by the India government that, just given the delays that are taking place there in the courts, there's no guarantee that we'll be able to get that back before the end of the year. The third item that I'd mention relates to the restructuring costs that we've incurred and plan to incur for the rest of the year related to the sizing of the business given the softness in the business. And with that, we expect to pay, as I said, about $25 million to $30 million more of restructuring costs for the full year. So those are the key highlights. So with that, we've guided relatively, to be relatively flat. We do see $150 million of risk related to that for the items that I had just mentioned.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry, the tax rate question?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","And on the tax, it is, it would be -- we're expecting it to be the 10% to 13% for Q3 and Q4. And as I mentioned, for 2014 going forward, we expect the effective tax rate to be in that 32% to 33% range.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then, Greg, I wonder if you could give us kind of a first responder LTE update. Anything noteworthy since the May Analyst Day?","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes, and that's a good question because that's also incorporated into the adjustment to the full year revenue outlook of -- from 3% to 4% to flat to 1%. It's primarily driven by Enterprise and we've now basically extracted out any planned LTE revenue contribution for this year. As I said in earlier comments, including at FAM in May, I always believed that our LTE revenues, from a material standpoint, would be largely internationally led first. I still believe that. And our engagements, particularly in the APME region, remain constant. But we're no longer, and I'm no longer, counting on closing that or those engagements this year and converting it to revenue. I think it's more prudent not to plan for that. And having said that, things in the U.S. continue to move forward in general, but NTIA has continued to freeze the BTOP grants. And FirstNet continues to move forward in their engagement. The only new development, I think, is LA-RICS. And LA-RICS negotiated a spectrum agreement with FirstNet, which we believe is positive. But having said that -- that's important. They still need to -- they, LA, need to work through how they're going to fund it, whether it's organically through their own means or a grant from the feds. But even after all that, they'll then do a bid that will be forthcoming. And we would expect revenue from that, if we were to be fortunate to win it, more in 2014. So interest remains high and engagement remains high, both domestically and internationally. And we'll move forward accordingly. But we've kind of taken LTE revenue out of our forecast for the remainder of '13.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup.","Asiya Merchant","This is Asi on behalf of Jim. Very quickly, can you tell us what iDEN was for this quarter? And what the expected contribution is for the year?","Gregory Q. Brown","IDEN was down $31 million in Q2 and we still expect it to be approximately $185 million in revenue for the full year this year, down from $265 million last year.","Asiya Merchant","Okay, great. And then on the OpEx side, I know you continue to maintain your operating margin guidance of 18%. Can you talk to us about some of the items that are impacting OpEx down so much? And sort of looking further out, how should we think about your OpEx run rate into 2014?","Gregory Q. Brown","Well, I'm not going to guide to 2014 yet, but what I will say is we remain committed to the 18% operating margin target for this year. I think, quite frankly, we've been pretty proactive along the way for the first half of the year in managing costs. We have taken action, or are in the process of taking action, that will result in annualized run rate savings of about $50 million for next year. And I think it's also important to note that for the full year this year, we expect total OpEx dollars to be down from last year. So we will continue to modulate the cost structure to reflect the pacing of revenues and size the business accordingly. And that's our plan. And quite frankly, I feel pretty confident in that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So you commented on the macro challenges in the Enterprise segment and some of the large deals that have pushed out into the Q4 and 2014. Are all of those deals still in the pipeline? Or have any of them gone to competitive solutions? And then just specifically to the traction that you talked about with the MC40 and the SB1. Just wanted to get a little bit more color there of who you're going up against. What you're seeing, if anything, in terms of off-the-shelf solutions, either iOS or Android-based, and just how those competitive discussions are going?","Mark F. Moon","So when you think about the push outs for Enterprise, Simona, in North America in particular, we had 4 very large nationwide retailers that actually selected us, but in very detailed conversations, said they were going to push out their deployments for later in the year, or a couple of them into next year. We also had a very similar conversation with a big-box retailer in the U.K. So to answer your question, we're not competitively losing these deals. It really is a delay in IT, CapEx, kind of spending that's driving this piece. Much different than what we really anticipated when we gave our previous guidance. I think as we think about competition, we believe that we're still holding share.","So as Greg mentioned, we think this is a phenomenon that's being experienced throughout. And we're excited about that particular piece, but disappointed that it is pushing out. When you think about new products, the SB1, as you mentioned, is primarily a task-specific tool to give workers the ability to do tasks on the go. Not really competing against consumer devices necessarily, it's really a device to give more efficiency and effectiveness to a broader base of workers. Our MC40 does move into the expansion category of customer-facing, where you would see competition against consumer devices, other types of products.","You asked about trials. We're trialing with several major customers, both in the U.S. and in the U.K. In fact, the SB1 was really designed around the requirements for Tesco in the U.K. and they're trialing it. We're also doing a number of pilots here in the U.S. with the MC40, some of which have tried consumer devices. So I think it's very positive. The piece that has been less positive at -- is that the pilots continue, and I will say continue successfully, but the conversion to actual projects have clearly been delayed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum of Morgan Stanley.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First a, Ed, just a clarification on the tax credits this quarter. I think I got $118 million is what you said. Is that -- I had down a 0% tax rate, so I think that was -- if you can just kind of go over where the tax credits this quarter came from, and how they differ from what we had before, and I might just be remembering things wrong from the Analyst Day, that'll be great.","And then, Greg, when you -- by going towards an operating margin target of 18% and making that the #1 goal, even on a lower revenue rate, can you give us some insight into where the areas are that you cut to get there. And if in fact, that's partially in R&D, how can you be sure you're not maybe mortgaging the future by cutting back a little bit too much when you should be actually investing to grow the business, as opposed to just focusing on the cost cutting. And then as you look at, again, at these push outs from these retailers and some of the other things that are slowing down the business, how do you get comfortable with the fact that this is either a secular trend towards consumer, especially because retail, of all the different sectors is probably the primary area where people are at least testing consumer devices, like iPhones and Android devices, as well as the Microsoft OS shift and how that's impacting this. Is that perhaps what's causing some of these push outs? Are they looking for the OS to get more stable? How do you get comfortable with the difference between a secular trend and one that's just cyclical with Enterprise push outs?","Gregory Q. Brown","So let me, Hudi, let me take the cost reduction one first. I mentioned that we've already taken action that we think will result in annualized savings for $50 million on an annual run rate. When I think of the larger areas that we've taken action in, they're largely in manufacturing capacity. They're in supply chain and procurement. They're in sales and marketing. R&D is on the lower end of the reductions and the actions that we've taken. So we remain committed to continue to lead and get high return on invested capital of R&D spend, which I anticipate will be right around $1 billion again. So I don't think we're impairing -- we're impugning any of our capacity from a new product and innovation standpoint. And we're not confused at all about that point.","Your second point about cyclical versus structural is in part jumping on Mark Moon's earlier answer to Simona. We're engaged on some of these new expansion products. We're very mindful of the engagements. In fact, some of these pilots are customers that have rolled out or trialed consumer product. And for a variety of reasons, whether it be voice, whether it be optimized voice integration with WiFi, post-sale support, ruggedization, in fact, they're reengaging us around the MC40. So I still believe, and we still believe, that this compression in Enterprise is more cyclical than structural because of the engagement and the direct discussions we have with customers.","To your point, I think Microsoft's OS transition is a component. They had the big reorganization just a few weeks ago. They're reintroducing or modifying Win Phone 8. When they do that, typically, they then add the Enterprise version, in our case, Windows Embedded Handheld, that trails that. So that OS for Enterprise utilization for us is a mid-2014 kind of phenomenon. We do think that's a contributor, but we still believe it's largely cyclical versus structural. But we watch it very closely, Hudi.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","So Hudi, on the tax item, if you remember at the Analyst Day, I had talked roughly orders of magnitude, talked about $100 million benefit that we record in the second quarter. It was $118 million. It was a bit better than we expected. The full year benefit, I quantified at approximately $300 million. It will be a bit better than that for the full year. And with that, we kind of embedded that into the 10% to 13% effective tax rate that we'll see for Q3 and for Q4, that which, we tightened the benefit from 10% to 15% that we had talked about at the Analyst Day.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, so I guess I just had gotten it wrong before at the Analyst Day, so that's helpful. Can I sneak in one more thing about the LTE funnel. Greg, you'd spoken in the past about a $1 billion LTE funnel, and then some time ago raised that to $1.5 billion LTE funnel, mainly driven by international. Is that something that we can still look towards at some point? Or is that -- has it gotten a little fuzzier with the recent changes in the LTE landscape?","Mark F. Moon","Yes, Hudi, this is Mark. I think the funnel size has really remained unchanged or actually would have increased slightly. What's happened, though, as it continues to elongate, actually tractions. So you understand what's going on in North America and I think as FirstNet continues to delay, we know about that delay and we talked about this primarily being international. And I think the international engagements that we've had have been slower than we thought to bring to actual contract, which is why now we push the revenue out of the year. But funnel activity and engagement and really no competitive losses, have really stayed intact.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","A question for you on the Asian management change that you guys discussed occurring earlier in the year. I guess, how is that progressing, and are you satisfied with traction that you're seeing in the Government space in terms of trying to penetrate lower into the smaller regions. And then obviously, as it plays out in the WLAN business as well?","Mark F. Moon","Perfect. So as we talked about earlier and we've talked each quarter about Asia, I think the management transition and actually our restructure within the region is progressing very well. In fact, while we talked about in Q1, the Government business was down further than we expected, we also commented that we expected it to improve each quarter as we went throughout the year, and for us to build backlog as we were going through the year. That has indeed happened. Our losses in second quarter are less than what they were in first quarter and as we move to third quarter, they will continue to improve. We are also exiting the quarter with more backlog. So the plan is in place and the team is doing well. I'm also very pleased with the Enterprise traction that we're gaining as we move to our different kind of geographic structure to get more attention. So the Enterprise business in total is also improving throughout the region. I think in the emerging markets that we talked about, that we really wanted to get after, that will be more new order activity as we exit the year to build for future growth. But again, I think we're making good traction and I'm pleased so far with the actions that have been taken.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","Great. And how does that parley into the WLAN business? Is that recurring at all, because you've obviously had a few past quarters of some significantly down year-over-year comparisons?","Gregory Q. Brown","This is Greg. WLAN improved from last quarter, but it still declined. It declined 5%. And we know that's not satisfactory, especially given the fact that the industry as a whole is growing probably double-digit, or low-double-digit growth, so we continue to lose share there. Now interestingly enough, we have some very, very nice opportunities and customer discussions that are going on right now. Cautiously optimistic and as I've said before, we're in transition from WLAN as a product play to more of a services play. And -- but we're closely monitoring the business and we need to do better and we know that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Two questions if I could. First, on the margin expectations going forward, you talked a little bit about OpEx. Just give us a little view on gross margin. Do you see any potential for that contributing in the second half, and as we look out into next year?","And then second, Greg, if I could, a longer-term question on LTE. What's your view as these networks become more standardized networks? What do you think the impact would be on MSI's more device-related business? Does it make it much more competitive since it's a much more open type of technology?","Gregory Q. Brown","I think, I'll take the second one. I think LTE in general is a favorable trend to our business. On the voice side, there's literally billions of dollars installed base for narrowband interoperable voice. It's built around a P25 standard. You know the position that we have there in ASTRO and TETRA. The idea in the U.S. behind FirstNet is a very good one. It dedicates spectrum in the 700-megahertz slice. It designates an open standard of LTE. And it provides money. So historically in public safety, some of the gates have been spectrum, standards and funding. And the legislation here in the U.S. contemplates and largely solves for that. I think what also will happen as these broadband networks get contemplated in the U.S. and internationally, and specifically, specifically around public safety, preemption versus a carrier model of prioritization, control, group call, direct, redundancy, encryption. I think those characteristics about interoperable LTE broadband are generally favorable to us because we have that expertise, we have that domain expertise and we can build an end-to-end LTE network of infrastructure, software and subscribers, to your point. So we view it as a favorable trend, both domestically and internationally.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Well, on the margin front, I'd say the expectation to be relatively stable. The fourth quarter typically, we do a bit better. Shipments are typically higher. You'll see a higher component likely of product sales as we talked about compression a bit in the Enterprise space because product sales have been the majority of the decline. As that returns, we'll expect a little bit better. And overall, with factory utilization being a bit higher fourth quarter, you typically will see a bit higher in the fourth quarter as you traditionally would.","Mark F. Moon","Throughout our core businesses in general, margin performance has been very good. We're pleased with that. We'll be down slightly year-on-year, but as we mentioned in the past, that's primarily driven by Psion and iDEN. So again, throughout the core portfolio, margins have held fairly consistent.","Operator","Our final question comes from Peter Misek of Jefferies.","Peter Misek - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","The big question that we have is around the timing of the Enterprise product launches for the balance of the year. Really want to help understand that. I kind of have difficulty, again, on that Q4 ramp as many of my peers are, and really would appreciate that.","Gregory Q. Brown","In terms of product launches, we've already launched largely the products that we're referencing. The SB1 is launched, the multi-plane scanner is launched, the MC40 is launched and the other discussions that, some of which Mark has referenced, are all with products that are already available, so we're not betting on the come here. And again, when you incorporate the flat to negative 3% for this quarter, and then you look at what growth needs to be in Q4, and we are typically a seasonally, very, very strong Q4 business, it contemplates a mid-single digit kind of growth rate. Again, on Enterprise coming off of a negative 10% compare in Q3 and a negative 10% compare in Q4, so that's kind of the foundation of logic that we have moving forward.","Peter Misek - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And if I may squeeze one in on the competitive landscape for LTE. There's been some discussion that, and I know you said generally, you felt LTE was a tailwind for you folks, there is a hypothesis out there that LTE actually removes some of your advantages. Can you help us understand the key differentiators that you would have versus a Harris or a Raytheon in the LTE deployment, maybe in and around the peer-to-peer technologies that you have, ruggedization, et cetera, just love to maybe a little bit of elaboration there?","Gregory Q. Brown","Well I think that, respectfully to our competitors, there's no one that has the R&D spend, the patent portfolio, the domain expertise and the product portfolio that we have in LTE. Remember, we started investing over 3 years ago in infrastructure, software and devices, whether it be USB dongle, a converged LEX 700, a vehicular modem and the like. In addition to that, we have a strategic partnership with Ericsson worldwide, with 8 years left. So as you take the worldwide leader in public safety in Motorola Solutions and the worldwide leader in commercial LTE in Ericsson, and we're optimizing our 2 product portfolios to be able to marry and merge and interoperate between a private network and a public network and seamlessly roam accordingly, I think the distinction and differentiation is substantial. And we expect to maintain or extend that competitive lead.","Shep Dunlap","Okay, I'd like to remind everyone the details outlining the highlighted items.

Our Q4 was a solid quarter for Motorola Solutions and we continue to see signs of recovery in large parts of our business. As I think about the quarter and beyond there are a few thoughts I'd like to share.","First, we continue to see improvement in our North America business. Q4 marked a return to growth and we're encouraged by indicators such as orders, backlog and device sales as we move into 2015.","Second, just last week we secured a contract valued at over $200 million with a country in the Middle East for a nationwide smart communications network, utilizing our public safety LTE solution.","This now gives us the three largest public safety LTE awards to date, with the LA-RICS contract implementation underway and $100 million deal in another Middle East country that begins deployment this year. It\u2019s encouraging to see investments made over the past several years, starting to drive associated revenue.","And third, our efforts around simplification and rationalizing our cost structure remain on course. We closed the year with more than $200 million in OpEx savings versus full year of 2013 and ended the year with a run rate that should position us well to achieve approximately $150 million of further reductions this year.","I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and our outlook.","Gino A. Bonanotte","Thank you, Greg. And good morning, everyone. Q4, 2014 revenue was $1.8 billion, a slight increase over Q4, 2013 and a reflection of robust order activity and faster than expected conversion of certain orders. These results come despite $27 million of currency headwinds in the quarter.","GAAP operating earnings were a loss $1 billion, which included a one time charge of $1.9 billion due to our pension de-risking transaction. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $483 million or 26.5% of sales, up from the year ago quarter of 21.8%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was a loss of $4.02 compared to a gain of $1.12 in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Non-GAAP EPS was $1.25 compared to a $1.37 in the year ago quarter, which included a $0.42 benefit from the formation of our international holding company in 2013. For the remainder of this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted.","Turning to segment results. In products, Q4 sales were a record $1.25 billion, up 3% versus the prior year\u2019s quarter. Growth was driven by strong demand in North America for a P25 and PCR device product lines, while TETRA devices grew robustly on a global basis.","Q4 product segment operating income was $394 million or 32% of sales, up from $283 million or 23% of sales in Q4 of 2013. Significant operating leverage provided by our cost reduction actions drove higher operating income.","Moving to product backlog. Product segment backlog is $1.2 billion, which has increased for three consecutive quarters. Product backlog is up $53 million versus last year and up $16 million sequentially despite strong revenues in Q4.","The year-over-year increase in backlog is driven by North America and APME. For the full year, operating income was $754 million or 19.8% of sales, which is up from last year due to cost reductions realized in 2014.","Turning to services. Q4 services revenue was $577 million, excluding iDEN, services revenue declined 2%, while declining 5% overall. Q4 integration services \u2013 revenue was down as expected versus Q4, 2013s record quarter which accompanied strong systems revenue in 2013.","Q4 Lifecycle support services grew modestly overall and strong demand for our software maintenance contracts and steady demand for our hardware upgrades. Managed services grew across all regions as increasing complexity and the need for enhanced capabilities to support software-centric IT base networks continues to drive demand.","Services operating income was $89 million, down $24 million to 15.4% of revenue driven primarily by lower iDEN sales and lower gross margin associated with systems integration mix.","Gross margin in lifecycle management, managed services and smart public safety was relatively flat. While we will continue to see project mix related pressure in the first half of 2015, we expect gross margins to return to the mid 30% range going forward for our overall services business.","Total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $431 million, down $86 million or 17% from the year ago quarter, driven by continued cost reduction activities. G&A and R&D posted the largest year-over-year declines and we expect significant savings across all major categories again for 2015.","Q4 other income and expense was a net expense of $39 million compared to $19 million in the year ago quarter. The difference was primarily driven by ongoing higher interest expense in Q4 of 2014 and gains on investment sales in the prior year quarter.","In Q1, we expect OIE of $45 million versus $19 million in Q1 of 2014 driven primarily by higher interest expense. Other income and expense is expected to be approximately $180 million for 2015.","With respect to taxes, our Q4 effective tax rate was 35%. Our Q1 and full year 2015 effective tax rate are expected to be approximately 33%. More importantly, we expect our cash tax rate to be approximately 15% for 2015 and continuing through 2019.","Turning to cash flow. Q4 cash flow from operations was a net use of $700 million which includes $850 million in funding related to the US pension de-risking actions, coupled with funding our UK plan. For the year, operating cash flow from continuing operations was a net use of $685 million driven by pension contributions of $1.3 billion.","We ended 2014 with $4 billion in total cash and $3.4 billion in debt. In Q4, we repurchased $1.4 billion of stock. For the full year, we repurchased $2.5 billion in stock.","We have reduced our net share count by 36% since the programs inception in Q3 of 2011. In addition, we paid $82 million in dividends during the quarter and $380 million [ph] for the year.","Turning to our outlook. We expect 2015 sales to be flat to down 2%. In constant currency terms, this translates to growth of 1% to 3% versus the prior year. For the year, we expect growth in North America, growth in Latin America, excluding iDEN, growth in the Middle East, we expect to be flat in Asia Pacific, inclusive of currency headwinds, contraction in Europe and Africa due to currency headwinds and the Norway implementation completion, and a decline in iDEN of between $25 million and $50 million.","We also expect OpEx to be approximately \u2013 to be down approximately $150 million year-over-year. Significant improvement in profitability, with EBITDA in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.36 billion, EPS of $3.15 to $3.35, and operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion for the full year.","In Q1, we expect sales to decline 2% to 4%, reflecting better than anticipated order conversion in Q4, along with approximately $40 million in currency headwind. In constant currency terms, we expect revenue to be down 1% to up 1%.","This outlook assumes North America growth for the quarter and a contraction in Europe and Asia driven primarily by currency headwinds. We expect Q1 EPS of $0.22 to $0.27.","I'll now turn it back to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown","Thanks. I'll now provide some additional color on our Q4 results and outlook. I am generally pleased with our Q4 results and more specifically the improving trends we're seeing in North America.","Q4 revenue was up slightly and marked the quarterly record for the company. Despite stronger than anticipated end of the year order conversion, and currency headwinds, our backlog position still continue to grow and we ended Q4 with a higher total backlog, higher product backlog, and higher backlog schedule to ship in 2015.","From a regional perspective, our North America business was up 4% in Q4, North America backlog is up $50 million in products and $586 million in services versus last year which is a positive sign for this region.","The Europe & Africa region declined 5% in Q4, which marked the first decline in nine quarters, currency headwinds was the key contributor to this decline and is expected to weigh on our full year results in the region.","However, I believe we have and will continue to execute well relative to the market in this region and are well positioned for long-term growth as these factors dissipate.","Turning to the Asia Pac Middle East region, we saw an 8% sales decline in Q4. This decline was driven by Asia Pac. However, sales are starting to stabilize in this region and backlog is up sequentially as we're seeing some improvements in the customer pipeline.","Our Middle East business continues to grow and build momentum in both product and services backlog. By the way these backlog numbers will continue to improve with the addition of the $200 million countrywide public safety LTE contract I referenced earlier.","And finally, our Latin America business in Q4 increased 3%, excluding iDEN and 1% overall. Backlog in Latin America is up modestly year-over-year and up significantly from a sequential view driven by services. To wind down of iDEN will continue to negatively impact this region disproportionately in 2015.","Turing to the segment highlights. First in products, we secured several strategic product awards in Q4, that include $148 million with the State of Michigan to upgrade their statewide ASTRO network, including over $30 million in services, $20 million with the state local customer in the Northeast, to upgrade to a fully P25 compatible solution with improved coverage and improved inner operability, $12 million with Eastman Chemical to enable their multi-state operations.","Moving to services. I am encouraged by Q4 revenue growth in lifecycle support and managed services. I think marketplace trends, such as the prevalence of video and social media used in policing [continue to validate our investments scenarios, such as real-time crime centers, video and data analytics and CAD integration. Services backlog is up significantly on new multi year deals despite currency headwinds.","Q4 brought several notable services wins, including a $64 million extension with Prince George's County to provide full turn-key services and maintaining their mission-critical systems and smart public safety systems, while keeping their networks up to date with various lifecycle products.","A two year $36 million managed services extension of the Victorian Mobile Data Network in Australia, $31 million with the Las Vegas Metro PD for long-term software and hardware maintenance of radio and CAD systems, as well as technical support in lifecycle services. And $50 million with Mininco in Latin America for a multi-year managed services contract to include administration and monitoring of their network, as well as the maintenance on their devices and a helpdesk for end users.","So, let me close by saying, this was a challenging, but transformational year for our company. We divested our enterprise business for just under $3.5 billion, significantly improved our risk profile and cash flow through pension de-risking actions, achieved more than $200 million in OpEx savings, including over $70 million in R&D reductions, while simultaneously shifting more investment towards new growth areas.","We restructured the company to increase our focuses on services as a line of business and reaffirmed our commitment to capital return and a more efficient capita structure with $5 billion of additional repurchase authorization and $2.9 billion of stock buyback and dividends returned in 2014.","As a result of these actions, we're in a better position. We're in a better position to grow, drive significant operating leverage, deliver strong cash flow and drive shareholder value for years to come.","I'll now turn it over to Shep.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks. Before we begin taking questions, I would like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and a follow up, so we can accommodate as many people as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line on how to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] We can take our first question from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kulbinder Garcha","Hi, guys. Yes, thanks for the question. I just wanted to clarify one thing about the revenue trends. And \u2013 so constant currency, just taking currency out of it, in Q4 you saw slight re-acceleration, but you're decelerating again in Q1 slightly. I know it's very slight, but I was under the impression that just given the order backlog, easy comps, and visibility in government, LTE, all these things were going kind of cause revenues to gradually reaccelerate as you went through the year, but you're starting the year off a little bit slow. That's kind of one question on revenues.","And on the first quarter earnings guidance, am I right that you're saying that the ops margin of the business is going to more than halve sequentially? That's a bit worse than the normal seasonal trend. I know obviously you have to look at what government used to do, but it seems a lot worse. Is there something on the cost side or mix side that is going to be significant in the first quarter or first half, that isn't there for the back half? Thanks.","Gino A. Bonanotte","Hello, Kulbinder. This is Gino. I'll \u2013 we'll start with Q1, I think it\u2019s instructive to note in Q1 that $40 million, we have $40 million of pressure from FX headwind in Q1. That\u2019s 3% \u2013 3 points of growth. As well as, iDEN being down $12 million, which represents another point of growth. In addition to about $40 million or 3 points of growth from better conversion of Q4 orders, more revenue in Q4. So that\u2019s really what's impacting Q1.","From a margin perspective in Q1, I think that was the second part of the question, earnings, we did as you referenced, we expect to continue to see some pressure in installation, in our installation services margin based on project mix and the projects that were expected to deploy continuing from Q4 into Q1. But we do expect that to stabilize and return to normal gross margin rates of 35%, all approximately 35%. Also, incremental interest in OIE as well was driving a little bit of the EPS.","Kulbinder Garcha","So Gino, to understand that point, this project mix, can you elaborate a little bit, because it's causing quite a seasonality, if I get your comments right, in the margin trends. So what exactly is it? And it goes away quite quickly, it sounds like. I'm just trying to understand what exactly is going on.","Gino A. Bonanotte","It does, it references some projects that we're currently deploying. As an example, the Nodnett project and we're deploying the northern part of Norway right now and the cost to deploy that is more challenging than the normal deployments. So it\u2019s really a reflection of the mix of projects we've had in Q1, Q4 and Q1 as those projects roll off the margin stabilizes.","Kulbinder Garcha","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Ashwin on behalf of Rod. Greg, I was hoping you could comment on recent FCC spectrum auctions and if there is any change in your thinking on the pace of US Public Safety LTE roll-outs.","Also if you could give us some sense of how much US Public Safety LTE is included in your 2015 revenue guidance. And is there any chance you can give us a growth rate excluding that for 2015?","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes. Just a few things. So, we had talked about Public Safety LTE being about double in 2015 versus our run rate in 2014. We still believe that that\u2019s the case and feel even better about that amount with the securing of the third contract I talked about in the Middle East. So we remain pretty resolute and expect that that will occur. But little bit north of a $100 million in 2015.","I think the auction spectrum developments recently are a positive, specifically as it relates to FirstNet, the $44 billion of proceeds by the federal government allows the fully funding of the $7 billion that\u2019s contemplated in the Middle Class Jobs Relief Act.","So, at the end of the day here in the US, the two most important things to facilitate and enable Public Safety LTE to be rolled out are dedicated spectrum and funding. The spectrum has been dedicated as you know at the 700 megahertz slice that remains dedicated to public safety. And the $7 billion is now fully funded with a very successful close of the AWS auction.","The only other thing I'd comment is our focus is on continued engagement globally on Public Safety LTE and there is still a pipeline of opportunities we'll pursue. But I think this year is quite important for us to implement the deals that we have, to implement LA-RICS, to start the implementation on the deal we just secured last week, and to implement in the second half of this year the other Middle Eastern country that we referred to with our $100 million deal.","And as we continue to compete and win on these deals, we see no chilling or impact on LMR and continue to see LMR purchases and Public Safety LTE to be additive to those purchases. So, I think the auctions are positive.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ehud A. Gelblum","Hey, good morning, guys. Appreciate it. A couple clarifications. Can you give us a sense as to what the headwind from Norway looks like as you go into 2015? And then the product backlog looks strong, it keeps going up. One of the things I wonder, you said, Greg, that the product backlog with respect to what falls in 2015 was strong as well.","Can you give us a sense to what the duration of that backlog did from the end of 2014 to the end \u2013 I am sorry from the end of 2013 to the end of 2014, with respect to if you were to say kind of the average of the backlog time wise. Did it stay relatively constant or are we putting more longer-term contracts into the backlog? Just to get a sense of how immediate that backlog is.","And then lastly, Gino, on the guidance, can you give us a sense as to where you think the gross and operating margins kind of settle out. We can back in to it a little bit from the EPS, but it's a wide range of EPS guidance for 2015. I just want to make sure we're kind of on the right page as to the way that the operating margin settles out. And what share count you were using to given all the buybacks that are going to happen, to get us in to that rate range of $3.15 to $3.35? Thanks.","Gino A. Bonanotte","Sure. Ehud, this is Gino. I'll start with respect to the Norway project, we're completing the implementation this year, later on this year and year-over-year 2015 versus 2014 there is less implementation revenue, approximately $50 million of less revenue from an implementation perspective.","As we talked about the gross margins, the system, I'll remind you that the system is primarily deployment of the infrastructure. The initial part of the project with the opportunity for incremental handsets and multi-year services beyond implementation. ","The phase that we're talking about is the implementation phase of the project.","With respect to margins, we expect gross margin profile to be consistent with last year overall and gross margins in product and services to be consistent.","Ehud A. Gelblum","And backlog?","Gino A. Bonanotte","Yes. The comment on backlog product, backlog as we mentioned product backlog is up. The duration of product backlog hasn\u2019t really changed significantly. In services backlog, as we incrementally add multi-year service deals, the duration of the services backlog does extend further than our traditional services backlog, which didn\u2019t include that magnitude of multi-year, in some cases, 15, 20 year service deals.","Gregory Q. Brown","Just a quick add on backlog thought, I think part of your question Ehud was, aging, as we talked about last year in Q1, for this year $125 million additional aged in to the year of our backlog.","Ehud A. Gelblum","Okay. That\u2019s helpful\u2026","Gino A. Bonanotte","And in constant currency terms that\u2019s reflected in the 1% to 3% growth.","Ehud A. Gelblum","Correct. On the OpEx, you mentioned that OpEx would be down $150 million, I believe, next year. That gets us to around 165, if I'm doing the math, a little lower than before. Are there more actions that you're \u2013 is that a new program that's being implemented or is my math wrong or is it \u2013 or does FX help you a little bit on the OpEx side as well?","Gino A. Bonanotte","I think Ehud as we continue to march forward and we go through this organization in a very systemic way, under what we call a program run by Michael Lannis. We continue to find opportunities to streamline and cost save.","We had $208 million of savings last year. We raised it to your point to approximately another $150 million, which by the way the majority of that from a run rate standpoint is already behind us, given actions taken last year.","I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a limit or a floor, but from a planning standpoint, we think that\u2019s the most useful amount to use at this point in time. But we will continue to simplify the organization, rationalize costs and as a pure play, we think those opportunities are extended to us.","Ehud A. Gelblum","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Gino A. Bonanotte","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona Jankowski","Hi, thanks very much. Wanted to just clarify on your backlog comment. Is your shippable backlog for 2015 up, and if you can just quantify, by how much? And then I just had a question on your federal exposure in the quarter. I know that was something you had expected to come back. If you can just give us some comments on how big that was, and how you see that going forward.","Gino A. Bonanotte","Simona, this is Gino. I'll start with the backlog question. Age backlog in 2015 is up and it\u2019s up $125 million. With respect\u2026","Simona Jankowski","Okay. And that\u2019s across products and services together?","Gino A. Bonanotte","That\u2019s correct.","Simona Jankowski","Okay. Great.","Mark F. Moon","So this is Mark. With respect to our federal government sales, as we talked about last year, we expected the federal government business to stabilize. We did actually realize slight growth in 2014. So it did perform as expected.","We still see that business continuing as we expect. We're kind of expecting flat to modest growth this year and we think it will relatively follow the way it normally has with first quarter and then ramping towards the federal close.","First quarter being a little bit slower, but really no big changes, that business now unlike what happened at the end of 2013 where we saw a real drastic reduction. It has stabilized for us as we go forward.","Simona Jankowski","And Mark, is that business about 10% of the total and with it being up a little last year and expected to be up a little this year. It feels like it's still kind of run rating maybe 20% or 30% below where it used to be kind of back in 2012 before all of these sequester actions and so forth came in to place. So would you expect that to come back to those levels at some point? Or is this a permanent decline?","Mark F. Moon","So, the size of the business is roughly 7% to 8% of our total. It was slightly over $450 million last year. You are correct, that it declined as we talked about when we had that $150 million reduction 25% to 30%. We're trying to not estimate a big ramp to grow back. We're trying to take a view that it will grow back slowly.","I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s permanently lost, but I don\u2019t expect that increase to be as drastic as the fall off that happened at the end of 2013.","Simona Jankowski","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tavis McCourt","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. First, on the gross margin guide, Gino, you indicated flattish year-over-year. I imagine foreign currency, although a modest headwind on the top line, has got to be a pretty material headwind on gross margin. So I'm guessing \u2013I'm just asking, what is the offset there that allows you to feel comfortable in kind of a flattish year-over-year despite the FX headwind?","And then Gino, I think Airbus's DS Communications business has been up for sale for a little while. Is there any strategic impact depending on who buys that? Any update on \u2013 do you have a preferable buyer, is there any update on kind of timing of that or is that something that you think just won't affect you either way? Thanks.","Gino A. Bonanotte","Thanks, Tavis. On gross margin the headwind from a product cost perspective is not as significant as I think you're modeling. Certainly we do have headwind. We also have some tailwind based on where we manufacture and where some of our \u2013 from a BGM perspective, where some of the work is done, as well as from a manufacturing perspective.","Mark F. Moon","And as it relates to, Tavis, as it relates to Airbus, I think their announcement to exit the business clearly is been positive for us. I think it provides disruption and dislocation to a number of customer installations that rely on them.","They have some interesting assets. We'll see how that plays out. But in the meantime, we are competing pretty vigorously on some key opportunities where we are not the incumbent. And we view that as an opportunity for us to pursue in 2015 and 2016. It\u2019s a good development for us.","Tavis McCourt","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Pierre Ferragu","Thank you, good morning. Just a quick question on international. So, if I understand one of your comments in Asia, excluding currency, you viewed as actually been growing in South America. This institution looks very stable and that's in Europe and Africa that most of your decline is. So my first question is Europe and Africa, excluding Norway, excluding currency, how do you feel the year like 2015 looks like?","And then my second question would be what's the longer term outlook for international? Is it the place where you would expect still very solid growth drivers, and would you expect international to actually grow faster than group average beyond this currency headwind, beyond like the \u2013 thus compare that Norway created for this year? Thanks.","Mark F. Moon","So Pierre, this Mark. As I think about international, I'll kind of give you a little color around the world, I'll start with the EA as you said. If you think of EA minus Norway and minus the currency headwinds as you said, the demand is still very positive in Norway. Our growth across the business has been good, again, excluding the currency headwinds which you asked me to do.","The pipeline is also good, which was referenced in the comment of Greg saying, he think as these factors dissipate you'll see Europe and Africa return to growth. We also see Africa is a good growth area for us in the future.","Latin America as you mentioned has been growing minus iDEN. We expect that trend to continue. iDEN will take down the overall numbers. But the core business in Latin America continues to grow.","Middle East is actually coming off of really strong growth. And we made some organizational changes to even put greater focus on the Middle East. We've announced the large Public Safety LTE deal today, but we also good growth in that region.","And then when we turn to Asia, as we talked about for a while, we've been disappointed with our recovery in Asia. But with that being said, we have built backlog. We actually have recognized some large deals, one of which was mentioned about Australia. We've got a good short term pipeline in addition to our backlog.","So we see the Asia region stabilizing and being relatively flat inclusive of currencies and it would be growth without the currency headwinds.","So all in all, to summarize and to answer your final question, we do see international. It\u2019s a growth area. The region again, minus the large project and minus currency headwinds, we would expect to grow at a faster rate than North America.","Pierre Ferragu","That's great. Thanks, Mark.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Keith Housum","Good morning, guys, thanks for taking my question. If we assume that FX rates today are roughly where they are today, does that change the competitive dynamics of where you guys do business around the world? I mean, doesn't it give Airbus or some of the Chinese competitors an advantage over you guys, based on how you guys go to market?","Gino A. Bonanotte","No, I don\u2019t think so, and especially with Airbus too given the disruption on what they are doing. But generally Keith, I would say broad base no.","Keith Housum","Okay. And then you guys talked obviously on top line about the impact that FX is going to have. But as it rolls down to the bottom line, is for both the fourth quarter and as you look out into the guidance, what impact is FX having on your EPS numbers?","Gino A. Bonanotte","Well, it clearly has a commensurate flow-through benefit on the cost structure as well. I think that is in part, incorporated into the revised $150 million of cost target that we are now committing to incremental in 2015.","That said, what I would say is despite fluctuation of foreign exchange rates, because I am pretty confident that they will bounce around, regardless to that, we are still pursuing approximately $150 million, despite currency fluctuation.","Keith Housum","But would it be safe to say that $0.05 or $0.10 would be higher if FX was not, I guess, as drastically changed over the past few months?","Mark F. Moon","I think it would be fair, more, closer to $0.05 than to $0.10.","Keith Housum","Got you. And then for the fourth quarter?","Mark F. Moon","For the fourth quarter really in EPS terms one or perhaps one or two.","Keith Housum","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our last question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Bollin","Good morning, thanks for taking the call. First question, when you look at the OpEx reductions that you've been identifying, you've upped the high end of the target now another $50 million. Greg, how much more opportunity would you expect. Is there any risk that you cut too deep?","And the second part question, a little different. Looking at LTE in North America, Greg, you identified funding and spectrum as being the key hurdles. When you think about a kind of a third hurdle being the political aspect, getting everyone on the same page and building consortium and understanding, where do you think we are in that process? Thanks.","Gregory Q. Brown","On the cost side, as I said, we've gotten, I think the team has responded really well in simplifying and reengineering business processes and getting unnecessary cost out. Largely as a result to the \u2013 being a pure play from a portfolio standpoint, and we're going to continue to do that.","I don\u2019t think there is a limit or a ceiling, my team knows that too. So, we're pleased, and by the way, when you think about and dimensionalize the $350 million of cost reduction coming off 2013, that more than replaces the earnings that the enterprise business was contributing that we just monetized to Zebra. So we like that fact and this business is set up well from an operating leverage standpoint when the top line returns.","On LTE, in the United States, I think funding in spectrum are enablers, I don\u2019t think they are hurdles, I mean, because they've been achieved. The spectrum is been dedicated in the funding has now been fully populated at $7 billion.","On the political front, you're right, it\u2019s the continual battle between federal and state, local control, what kind of architecture and the number regions. The only thing I would say Ben is we work more closely with FirstNet than we've ever done before and we're committed to their success and working with them, in particular, at NTIA to make sure LA-RICS gets rolled out appropriately.","So the political side of that will continue to unfold in 2015 and 2016 and our government affairs team and the business development people of sales organizations are working hand and glove with them. So we are coordinated and achieving the opportunities and the expectations that people have with that network.","Benjamin Bollin","Thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown","You bet.","Operator","And as we have no further questions. I'll turn the floor back over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations for any additional or closing remarks.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks. As mentioned at the outset, we made a number of forward-looking statements during the call, including outlook related to OpEx, gross margins, other income expense, sales, EBITDA, EPS, operating cash flow, as well as effective and cash tax rates, currency impact, growth and contraction by region, iDEN revenue declined and backlog, as well as the growth of Public Safety LTE. Thanks and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of this call will be available over the Internet in approximately 3 hours.

In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 3 hours after the conclusion of this call over the Internet. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com\/investor. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Dunlap, you may begin.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks, and good morning. I would like to welcome you to our call to discuss financial and operating results for the fiscal 2014 third quarter. With me this morning are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President and CFO; Mark Moon, Executive Vice President and President of Sales and Product Operations; and Bob Schassler, Executive Vice President of Solutions and Services. Greg and Gino will review our results, along with commentary, and Mark and Bob will join for the Q&A portion.","We have posted an earnings presentation and press release at motorolasolutions.com\/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference, and we encourage you to review those.","I also want to remind everyone that as a result of the divestiture of our Enterprise business, which was announced on April 15, 2014, and closed on October 27, 2014, the Enterprise business, other than iDEN, is reflected as discontinued operations for both the current quarter and prior periods. All financials cited will reflect the company's remaining business with its reporting segments of Products and Services.","In addition to the financial results summarized in the press release and in this call, you can find additional information, including full year information, in our Form 10-Q, which will be filed later today.","A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation.

Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements contained in this presentation.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown","Thanks, Shep, and good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We're encouraged by third quarter revenues and earnings, and our business continues to show signs of improvement. As I think about the quarter and beyond, there are a few thoughts I would like to share.","First, Q3 sales were better than expected as a result of strength in the Europe & Africa region, improvement in North America and faster conversion of a number of orders that were initially projected for Q4. The environment in North America is beginning to improve as we delivered better-than-expected system sales, saw more normalized Federal demand and drove an increase in backlog. Customer engagements and order pipeline activity remain healthy and consistent with our earlier views for a strong second half of the year.","Second, we continue to more aggressively take costs out of the business and remain fully on track to achieve our target of approximately $300 million plus in savings by the end of 2015. We've reduced operating expenses by nearly $120 million through the first 3 quarters of this year compared to the same period in 2013. And we now expect slightly more than $200 million in savings for the full year this year of 2014. Our teams are taking action to reduce complexity and redundancy, which will ultimately improve operating leverage.","Third, I'm thrilled with the successful close of our Enterprise transaction, which was done at an attractive valuation and puts us on the path of a singularly focused business in the attractive space of mission-critical communications and public safety.","Finally, we remain acutely focused on growing this business and optimizing our capital structure. As a result of our strong balance sheet and cash-generating capabilities, today we announced the addition of $5 billion to our share repurchase authorization, raising the total amount to $12 billion. We believe this is an important action that underscores our confidence in the fundamentals of our business and our ability to grow EBITDA and free cash flow over the long term and demonstrates our ongoing commitment to creating value for our shareholders through thoughtful and disciplined capital return.","I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 results and our outlook and then we'll return to provide additional thoughts and color on the quarter.","Gino A. Bonanotte","Thank you, Greg. Q3 2014 revenue was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 5% from last year. GAAP operating earnings were $207 million or 14% of sales. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $259 million or 18% of sales. Operating cash flow was a use of $115 million, driven by $397 million of U.S. pension contributions during the quarter related to our pension de-risking actions announced in September.","On a GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.27 compared to $0.98 per share in the third quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations were $0.62 per share compared to $1.08 in the year-ago quarter, which included a $0.35 benefit from the formation of our international holding company in 2013. Accelerated cost reductions and higher sales both drove favorable EPS relative to our outlook. For the remainder of this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, unless otherwise noted.","Q3 Products sales were $921 million, down 8% versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower device sales. Despite this decline, our North America business again improved sequentially. In addition, our PCR business grew in North America and Europe & Africa, as Europe & Africa posted another strong quarter. Systems revenue was down slightly versus the year-ago quarter, although revenue was up both in North America and Europe & Africa. Finally, product backlog was up sequentially, led by North America. And coupled with a healthy pipeline, we believe the North American market is beginning to recover.","Products segment operating income was $175 million or 19% of sales, down from $204 million or 20% of sales in Q3 2013. The decline in operating income was a function of lower sales, offset by cost reductions.","Turning to Services. When normalizing for iDEN, Services grew at 2% for the quarter. Services sales in Q3 were $515 million, a decrease of less than 1% from the prior year. Systems integration and lifecycle services were flat, while Managed Services was up double digits, and Smart Public Safety grew single digits versus the prior year quarter. Integration services was up slightly on large projects, such as TETRA deals in Europe and the North America LA-RICS LTE deployment. Lifecycle support services held steady, with significant contributions from system maintenance contracts and software upgrade agreements. Managed Services was up double digits, with strong growth across all region, while our Smart Public Safety business is being driven by more command and control revenue from early market traction. We are pleased with the performance and competitive position of these new services and look for continued growth.","Operating income in the Services segment was $84 million, down approximately $8 million to 16.3% of revenue, driven primarily by lower iDEN sales. Services gross margin was in the mid-30s, generally consistent with past performance and up from Q2.","Total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $434 million, down $43 million or 9% from the year-ago quarter, driven by continued cost-reduction activities. We now expect 2014 OpEx to be down more than $200 million versus the prior year.","Our year-to-date operating expenses are down $120 million, the key drivers of which include staff reductions, lower 2014 incentives and organizational efficiencies across all aspects of our business. Approximately 1\/3 of the savings has been in R&D, with the balance of savings in SG&A. Examples of actions we have driven include consolidation of testing processes and lab sites, leveraging development teams and support cost and eliminating staff or moving work to lower-cost location. In selling and marketing, we have simplified the organizational structure and reduced sales support cost by lowering our overall nonquota-carrying employee base.","In G&A, we've simplified our management structure across spans and layers while increasing the use of centralized services. And while we're relatively pleased with our progress on cost, there is more work to do.","Shifting to other income and expense. This line item was a net expense of $29 million compared to a net gain of $5 million in the year-ago quarter. We expect this line item to be approximately $45 million per quarter, primarily driven by interest expense.","With respect to taxes, our Q3 effective rate was 33%, and we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be the same. We still expect our cash tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 15% for full year 2014 and a cash tax rate of approximately 15% through 2019.","Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operating activities in the third quarter was a net usage of $115 million, which includes a $397 million contribution related to the U.S. pension transaction announced in September. For the year, we expect operating cash flow from continuing operations to be a net use of approximately $250 million. This includes the incremental funding of our U.S. plan, of which $650 million remains to be funded in Q4. Excluding these discretionary pension contributions related to the pension de-risking transaction, the annual operating cash flow would be approximately $550 million, as previously guided. Let me also remind you that our actions taken on pension de-risking will require no U.S. cash contributions for the next 5 to 6 years. Let me also reiterate our conviction to retain our investment-grade rating as we move forward with returning the proceeds in a timely manner.","We ended Q3 with $2.8 billion in total cash and $3.4 billion in debt. In Q3, we repurchased $650 million of stock or approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price of $62.63 per share. Since the program's inception in the third quarter of 2011, we've reduced our net share count by 30% at an average price of $52.08 a share. In addition, we paid $78 million in dividends during the quarter.","In discontinued operations, Q3 revenues for Enterprise grew 2% year-over-year to $605 million in the quarter. We saw solid growth in both North America and Europe throughout most of the portfolio.","Now turning to our outlook. We expect Q4 sales to decline by 1% to 3%. This outlook is consistent with our prior full year view of a low to mid-single-digit sales decline, excluding iDEN. We expect non-GAAP operating earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $1.13 and $1.19 per share in Q4. As a reminder, Q4 2013 included a $0.42 benefit from the formation of our international holding company.","I'll now turn it back to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown","Thanks, Gino. Now I would like to provide some additional color on our outlook and the Q3 results.","From a regional perspective, the North America market is improving consistent with our prior outlook for the second half of 2014. Another quarter of sequential sales improvement and growing backlog are the foundation for the North America recovery, as recent headwinds pressuring the North America market continue to fade. Europe & Africa posted another strong quarter, marking its eighth consecutive quarter of growth for this region. Growth was robust across devices, systems and services and across most countries. Middle East was flat for the quarter but up year-to-date, and we believe our prospects continue to improve there moving forward. Asia Pac performance was lower than expected, but we expect to see positive results next year due to improved backlog, strong pipeline and ongoing customer engagement.","Looking at Products -- looking at our Products segment. We improved sequentially in North America and had another solid performance in Europe and Africa. From a product perspective, we shipped the APX 7000L, the industry's first converged P25 LTE device with the security of LMR mission-critical voice and the benefits of LTE data speeds.","We launched the LEX L10, a mission-critical LTE handheld device that intelligently prioritizes and displays only the most critical information to first responders based on current status and activity. The LEX L10 supports both Public Safety LTE private networks and commercial LTE networks.","We're providing a solution to an ASTRO P25 customer to upgrade their radio system and perform interconnection with commercial smartphones. This solution uses the wave technology from our Twisted Pair acquisition and will be our largest implementation to date for connecting P25 radios with broadband devices.","Key strategic system awards around the world include 5 North America P25 wins with state and local customers worth over $10 million each, a $21 million contract with the Ministry of Defense in Africa, $10 million of Armed Forces solutions in both Latin America and Asia Pacific\/Middle East, several multimillion dollar TETRA awards with national police in both Europe and Africa and Asia Pacific, a national defense subscriber contract in Europe and a $5 million nationwide subscriber order.","Turning to our Services segment. Our Services segment turned in another quarter of growth when excluding iDEN. Our increased focus in Services positions us well for the future, as communications networks become increasingly complex, software based and feature rich. This complexity and increased functionality are enabling the next phase of Services growth that includes Lifecycle Management solutions, Managed Services and Smart Public Safety solutions. Smart Public Safety solutions includes command and control, Intelligence-Led Policing, Public Safety applications and Public Safety LTE services.","Q3 brought several notable Services wins, including a $16 million contract for Loudoun County, Virginia to intelligently connect and manage the myriad of systems and subsystems for enhanced public safety functionality; an $8 million computer-aided dispatch consoles and subscriber services migration over 5 years in Spartanburg County, South Carolina. An emerging growth area in which we are making progress includes our Smart Public Safety solutions, and we earned a contract with Elgin, Illinois for the implementation of the real-time intelligence console. This is a key component to our Real-Time Crime Center solution that will integrate video and other solutions with an agency's existing system, including dispatch platforms to help identify and distribute information to first responders. By sharing the right information at the right time, agencies can shorten response time, proactively deploy resources and increase situational awareness.","So let me close with a few thoughts. First, the business is improving, anchored by the continued turnaround in North America. Second, we are aggressively moving to lower our cost structure and resize this company to be more competitive over time. Third, with the Enterprise sale, we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on our simplified structure and growing our business. And finally, by doing these things and executing on these priorities of growth, operational excellence and capital return, we will be well positioned for the long term and will ultimately drive shareholder value.","I'll now turn it back over to Shep.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line on how to ask a question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You announced a deal, I think, a couple of days ago with Telstra for enabling public safety applications on their LTE network. Can you just comment on how common you think this type of implementation might be as opposed to the more traditional public safety network? And also just curious if you saw a similar set of competitors in that deal as your traditional competitors.","Robert C. Schassler","Simona, this is Bob Schassler. We see those types of customers are where we don't have private broadband spectrum around the world, like in Europe and in Australia. And we really see the competition being very similar to what we're doing in the private business as well in the private LTE business.","Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. Okay. And is the economics, from an MSI perspective, pretty similar to the dedicated public safety network in terms of the devices, except that you're missing the infrastructure piece? Is that how we should think about it?","Robert C. Schassler","Yes, they'll be very, very similar. The operating margins for both models are very, very similar.","Simona Kiritsov Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then just a quick follow-up for Gino. On the $5 billion repurchase authorization, how should we think about the pace of that into next quarter and next year?","Gino A. Bonanotte","Simona, the pacing, I think it's in -- a useful reference point for pacing is our Q3 buyback of 615 -- $650 million that -- as I said, that would be a useful reference point at this time on pacing and what our expectation is moving forward.","Operator","And we'll go next to Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Wondered, first, if you could just let us know what the iDEN headwind or revenues was in the quarter and an update on kind of full year expectations on that product line. And then secondly, Greg, the -- it sounds like the systems business was flat to slightly up, but the devices business was down 8%. And I'm trying to like -- what are the dynamics in the market that lead to a bifurcation like that?","Gregory Q. Brown","From an iDEN perspective, I believe -- Gino will get the exact quarterly number. $25 million for Q3? Okay, it's down $25 million in Q3. Remember, we guided you to being down $100 million -- approximately $100 million for this year. iDEN continues to tail off. From a 2015 perspective, we're planning on iDEN being down approximately $50 million. In terms of devices, maybe I'll turn it over to Mark Moon.","Mark F. Moon","I'm sorry, Tavis, would you give me that question one more time?","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, no problem, Mark. So I think in the prepared script, Greg mentioned that the systems business was flat to up, and this might be a North American comment, but devices sales were down 8%. And I'm wondering, what are the dynamics in the market that lead to a bifurcation between the growth rates in systems and devices?","Mark F. Moon","Yes, Tavis, I think what we still see is some of the remnants of narrowbanding, which we've talked about a lot. We do think through the end of this year, the bulk of the narrowbanding pressure will be behind us. There will be some trickle into next year, but as you think back to narrowbanding, we had a big acceleration in '12 and, really, through the first half of '13, which we believe accelerated about 2 years of business. So we've seen devices, if you will, that particular growth drop off. Now with that being said, as we look at the funnel, we look at the pipeline, even as we look at some of the activities in Q4 and beyond, we do think devices will come back. So not really unexpected for the quarter, and quite honestly, the fact that we're still driving good strong infrastructure sales, we feel positive about that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Two questions, if I could. First, obviously, you guys have made really good progress on the OpEx front. Could you talk a little bit about gross margin? Looks like it's been down through the first part of this year, a few years in a row here. So maybe if you could just talk about opportunities, kind of what's dragging it down and opportunities to recapture some gross margin. And then, Greg, if you could just touch a little bit more on the Federal. You said it was pretty strong in the quarter. Do you think there's been any change there, like you've seen in overall North America? What do you think about the outlook for Federal for the next few quarters here?","Gregory Q. Brown","So Federal, I'll take that one first. As you may remember, last year was pretty dramatic, with about $150 million decline in the second half of last year. We think it's normalized. In fact, in Q3, Federal was up 13%. And in Q4, Tim, we expect it to be up again in double digits. So we're pleased with the stabilization and the return to growth for Federal.","Gino A. Bonanotte","Tim, with respect -- this is Gino. With respect to gross margin, the gross margin decline, the gross margin, actually, is up quarter-over-quarter, in line with our expectation, as a result of a little bit favorable mix. And we will continue to see that trend into Q4. Favorable mix and better sales will yield better gross margin. And I think going forward, as narrowbanding -- the bulk of narrowbanding is behind us, and we have growth in the device business, we'll see margin stabilizing.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First, just a clarification on a prior question about iDEN. Just wanted to make sure I understood correctly. Greg, I think you said that iDEN this quarter was down $25 million year-over-year, and that was totally in line with your guidance. On the last conference call, you'd said you thought iDEN would be down $100 million this year. Was your comment that it would be down $50 million, was that a this year comment or a next year comment? So did I...","Gregory Q. Brown","You're right on the $25 million in Q3 decline. You're right on the $100 million to decline full year 2014. And my $50 million decline for iDEN was a 2015 comment. Just because we have great visibility on that because it's contractual, so I wanted to just let you know that to guide you accordingly.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, that's very helpful. I wasn't sure I heard you right, so that helps out a lot. A question on Federal and then a question on Europe & Africa. Following up on the Federal comment, the double-digit increases you had now in Q3 and then expect again in Q4, does that bring you back to the same level that you were doing in Federal for -- I assume, let's use, I guess, 2012 as a baseline? Or does that put us still short of it? Or does it -- and therefore, do you expect the levels -- was 2012, basically, a peak level? Or is that a level that we're going to go through as we get into 2015? Just trying to get a sense on a growth rate level, where that puts us vis-\u00e0-vis kind of where we were before. And then Europe & Africa, as you mentioned, have been strong, I think, for 8 straight quarters, good growth there. Can you just go over some of the drivers there? And I assume it's all TETRA, but what are the competitive dynamics going on there? Is there anything like a regulatory issue, like narrowbanding, that maybe we could point to that can explain some of that growth and a sense as to how sustainable it is and how far we should be able to model that going forward? Or could there be potential ups and downs and cyclicality in that, similar to what happened in North America?","Gregory Q. Brown","On the Federal business, up 13% in Q3. I expected double-digit increase in Q4. Ehud, when you model that out, it's flat to slightly up with last year's Fed volume but still substantially short of the 2012 year that you referenced. So we view that as opportunity to try to grow going forward.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","How much below the 2012 level are we?","Gregory Q. Brown","Probably loosely 25% or 30%.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And do you think that's a reasonable level, to get back to the 2012 number? Or was that a peak?","Gregory Q. Brown","No, we'll see. We'll see. We'll model the business and see what comes -- it all depends on a whole host of things in terms of the politics and the continuing resolution and budgets at the Federal level. But we do think that we can grow from the base performance of this year into next year, but we'll guide you accordingly as to the specifics and how it would dimensionalize in '15 and beyond.","Mark F. Moon","Ehud, as far as Europe & Africa, we have had continued very strong success; in fact, 8 consecutive quarters, as you mentioned, but really 3 years of very solid growth. It's really driven across the board. I mean, our performance has been strong. When -- even when you look at Western Europe, we're actually gaining share across the board. And our PCR business was very strong in Q3. Our TETRA business has been very strong. And we've been fortunate to have a number of large projects within the region that has really boosted revenues. We talked a lot about Norway being one of the largest projects we've ever had. So Bob and his team have been in the middle of implementation, which has drove a lot of revenues over the last 2 years. We've also had a couple of other very large projects in Northern Africa as well as other spots. So I think the comparable, as we go into next year, will be tough for sure because the bleed-off of the Norway implementation, in particular, will cause some pressure. But that business, the reason I described it the way I did, has been solid across the base. So while I don't think we'll see the high-growth rates which we've had going forward, I do think that business will return back to normalization as we move into the next year and beyond.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kulbinder Garcha with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of questions from me. First of all, I guess, for Greg, in terms of with the order book and the inflection of revenues you are now seeing with narrowbanding behind you, is it fair to say that we should be heading back towards your long-term revenue growth rate in Government in 2015? Do you feel comfortable with that statement? Or is there still things shrouding the visibility? That's my first question. The second one is for Gino. On the free cash flow side, what is the pro forma free cash flow of MSI, would you say, just given the pension change, given the Government, the working capital dynamics? That's one thing I'm kind of struggling with a little bit.","Gregory Q. Brown","Kulbinder, from a backlog standpoint, Product backlog was up $30 million, primarily driven by North America Services. Long-term multiyear contract for Services was down $90 million, pretty much as a result of FX. I think that on the positive side, North America backlog was up $120 million: $60 million in Products, $60 million in Services. And also, we had a very, very good start in October in terms of backlog and order volume around Federal orders that didn't close in September but came in, in October and some very notable state and local deals as well.","Gino A. Bonanotte","And with respect to cash flow, Kulbinder, and we'll guide, obviously, when we guide 2015 in pro forma and beyond. But I think a reference point that may be useful is our expectation for 2015 would be to, from an operating cash flow perspective, be comparable to our 2013 operating cash flow as MSI, so effectively replacing the cash flow from the Enterprise transaction.","Gregory Q. Brown","And Kulbinder, the answer is yes to your question of we still believe that the business, longer term, is a low to mid-single-digit business that, over time, we will return to as we come back out of the trough with narrowbanding.","Operator","And we'll go next to Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein.","Pierre Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First, could you give me a bit more color on your very impressive cost-cutting project? Wherein the question I have is, how is that happening in your -- on the field in your sales force? In -- I mean, your strength in the market is very much related to your ability to be very close to your customers. So if you reduce your cost base, how do you make sure you don't lower the level of service you're able to provide to your clients? And then I have a quick follow-up on Public Safety LTE. Things have moved very positively this quarter on a couple of deals. Should we expect Public Safety LTE to accelerate in 2015? And if that's the case, any impacts we should think of in terms of your gross outlook for 2015 and also your gross margin impact potential in 2015?","Gino A. Bonanotte","Okay, Pierre, this is Gino. I'll take the cost-reduction question first. So clearly, ahead of schedule, with more than $200 million, as Greg described, year-over-year reduction in 2014 and $43 million in Q3. Year-to-date, $120 million, and I think it's instructive to look at the composition of that. As you know, we talked about it in prior calls, our effort around simplifying the company. So the exercise is not an exercise in cost reduction per se, but it's an exercise that gets at trying to reduce the complexity that was inherent in the larger Motorola organization. So of the $120 million, 1\/3 is in R&D. And you shouldn't read that as necessarily a reduction in R&D, a project R&D. It's the -- a reduction in structure, management structure and structure across R&D. The rest is SG&A, and it's really a combination of headcount, site consolidation, simplifying org structure and centralizing some shared services.","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes, and as we go about these reductions, Pierre, it's also important to note that we have prioritized nonquota-carrying salespeople. So it's more of the shared infrastructure around SG&A, in particular, that Mark and Bob have done a very good job in terms of prioritizing those reduction. As it relates to Public Safety LTE, we're expecting approximately $50 million of revenue this year. And as we look into 2015, based on current contracts, we would expect that to more than double next year. So as we kind of dimensionalize 2015, and obviously, we're not going to guide to it, we expect to end Q4 with higher total backlog, higher product backlog, higher backlog scheduled to ship in 2015. I mentioned the $50 million decline in iDEN. When we think about Europe & Africa, we anticipate some contraction in '15 with macro headwinds after higher-than-normal growth for 3 consecutive years, largely driven by some of the large projects Moon just referenced, like Norway. We expect Latin America and APME to grow. And we do expect some modest growth in North America as well, with the bulk of narrowbanding largely behind us and, basically, effectively, complete by midyear.","Pierre Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. And maybe, if I can, a quick follow-up on your churn business, could you take us through how it has been evolving across the last couple of quarters?","Gregory Q. Brown","What business, Pierre, again?","Pierre Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Churn business. So what didn't come from your backlog in the last couple of quarters?","Gregory Q. Brown","Quick turn. The quick turn.","Pierre Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Sorry, the turn business.","Mark F. Moon","So Pierre, this is Mark. So as we talked about coming into the year, we knew all year that we were coming in backload-light. We would have to have strong, what we call, quick turn or, as you just said, churn business, which means we get the order, book it, ship it in the current quarter. That has continued to be strong throughout and really on schedule. We always knew that the year was going to be back-end loaded. The second half still looks the same. It's what we told you on the last call. We were able to accelerate some of that business. I think Greg mentioned earlier, we've been relentlessly focused on getting new orders and converting those orders to revenue. We were able to convert $40 million more than we originally expected of Q4 orders into Q3. And the churn business for Q4, which will again be a big part of our number, we continue to remain with good visibility and pipeline on exactly what we've got to go do to commit our overall guidance for the second half and now for Q4.","Operator","And we'll go next to Rod Hall of JPMorgan.","Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of things. I wanted to just check on the backlog numbers, the changes in backlog. You said the Services backlog was mainly affected by FX. Can you give us any idea what the backlog change would be in constant FX in the quarter? And then also, I wanted to go back to the question about gross margin and just ask you guys, could you foresee the back end of 2015 showing up with a 50% or better gross margin?","Gino A. Bonanotte","Okay, Rod, this is Gino. On the -- on backlog, as Greg mentioned, although, sequentially, backlog is down $60 million, Product backlog is up $30 million, driven by North America. The multiyear Services backlog down $90 million is essentially all related to FX and the aging of those multiyear contracts in future period based on current FX.","Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Are you saying then that Services backlog would have been flat in constant FX?","Gino A. Bonanotte","Yes. And North America backlog -- and I think Greg mentioned that North America backlog is up $120 million sequentially, $60 million of which is Product, and $60 million of which is Services. And on gross margin, I don't know that we'd be ready to talk about a specific number. We do see with mix stabilizing, we talked a little bit about devices versus infrastructure and deployment services, we do expect gross margin to stabilize, and we'll update you after our Q4 call on what...","Roderick B. Hall - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Would you be able to say anything about what your -- what kind of gross margin target you have in mind, medium-term target?","Gino A. Bonanotte","Comparable. Obviously, as you might suspect, there are many variables. The $50 million of iDEN reduction, at this point in its life cycle, at very high margins. The composition of some services, LTE services and services in general, changes that gross margin mix a little bit. Even though we've specifically talked about Services at operating margin being comparable to Product, it does impact the gross margin. So while I could -- we can talk about specifically in the Product -- in our Products segment, in aggregate, comparable margins.","Operator","And we'll go next to Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","A question for you a little more on the backlog. You speak to North America being really strong in terms of leading the backlog growth. Can you speak to, on a geographic basis, on how it's looking in other geographies?","Mark F. Moon","So you -- in fact, you just mentioned North America, and really, the North America piece, just a quick comment on that, then I'll kind of take you around the other regions. So the North America piece was actually even stronger than what we talked about when you think about the $40 million that got converted in Q3 as well as, Greg mentioned, we had a very good first week. The Federal close spilled over into the first week of October, and that was $35 million more of orders in the first couple of days that really would've looked like quarter-ending backlog but, because they spilled over, did not. We also had 3 large North America orders in state and local that we thought would close before the end of quarter, that subsequently closed early in October for about $65 million more. So that North America backlog, very strong, which it needed to be because North America is a big piece of our Q4. Now as you go around the world, we have consistently built backlog in Asia. It's been more longer term that, as Greg just mentioned, we think will come to fruition as we go into next year. And in Europe & Africa, as we work off the large projects, we are working off some of the backlog, which was the comment a little bit earlier about the contraction that we would expect next year, given the headwinds and the effort of these large projects. But overall, again, very good order visibility and good quality around the piece. I think the Europe & Africa result is really just a result of Norway and one other large project being worked off through implementation, of which there are several other large projects around the world in the pipeline, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, as we think about what will be in the very near future.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","Okay. I appreciate that. Then in terms of FX, FX has obviously been very volatile over the past few months. How does the FX impact your guidance going forward, I guess, compared to -- as you look at it now given the guidance versus where it, perhaps, would've been 3 months from now, perhaps?","Gino A. Bonanotte","FX is incorporated -- our view of FX is incorporated in the guidance we've given.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","Did it bring down your -- perhaps, your revenue guidance by 1% or 2% or have any impact on your EPS guidance?","Gino A. Bonanotte","It did. It did a bit. And obviously, every quarter, it moves around a bit, and that's why we really don't specifically talk about it. But yes, the answer is yes, it did.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, a question on FirstNet. In some of the conversation we've had with some of the large entities in North America, some of the large regional service areas for SMR services like, say, Houston, they're starting to ask, do we need FirstNet? Can we just go with using the public LTE networks, similar to what the kind of the arrangement we have with Telstra, leveraging their -- the network that's already built and then using our radios to connect to it, leasing service from them rather than building out a whole new duplicate LTE network nationwide? What would your growth rate be, looking out over the next couple of years, if FirstNet isn't a go, if it's not a project that gets broadly deployed? And what's your view -- can you kind of give us an update on FirstNet in general and your view of it? And then second question, what are you seeing competitively up? Are you seeing much competition on the LTE front on a global basis?","Mark F. Moon","So let me take it kind of in chunk. I think, first off, whether it's a carrier-led deployment or whether it's a private deployment of Public Safety LTE, we intend to play. We think we have a broad portfolio that plays -- and capabilities that plays across the board. We've had great interactions with FirstNet. And you may or may not know, but FirstNet has been proceeding along. They just finished a process for an RFI that had broad responses, of which we were one of them. The plan is for a more comprehensive RFP in the early part of next year. So they're moving forward. I think the important thing to note in North America is there was a big effort by public safety to say we need dedicated spectrum, and this was a big move to say it is different than operating on a carrier network. And most of our customers know that. There are certain things you can do, but in times of crisis or disaster, you need to ensure that you have that dedicated spectrum, so you can operate, which hasn't been the case with a lot of carrier networks. So carriers will be a component, just like Telstra, as you said, but where you've got spectrum to have an augmented private network is very critical. So -- and you mentioned the Houston area. They just recently were granted an SLA by FirstNet. They continue to move forward with their deployment, but they will be a part of the overall network. And similar is true for LA-RICS and others. So from a revenue perspective, we're proceeding. We're happy with our couple of implementations that are ongoing, but we plan and anticipate to work closely with FirstNet as they work to build out an overall nationwide network. From a competitive basis, as we've mentioned several times, we've been investing in Public Safety LTE for the last 3 years. We think that we have differentiated ourself from the other commercial carrier offerings. We are partnered with Ericsson, who we think has been a phenomenal partner for us from a RAN perspective. And in certain countries like, we mentioned, Australia, we're also partnered with one of the top carriers like Telstra here in North America. We've worked with Verizon and in the U.K. with Vodafone. So we will have a combination of efforts, but we think we have the capability of bringing a unique offering that really is tailored for public safety.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","First question, looking back at the competitive landscape, when you look at P25, do you have any thoughts on how it's influenced pricing behavior and customer bidding initiatives in the handheld market? And then I have a follow-up.","Mark F. Moon","So I think P25 is a very open, interoperable standard. It was designed by APCO, which is Association of Public-Safety Communication Officers, so it's clearly a square playing field with products that go throughout a broad range of pricing. Primarily, P25 is in North America, as you're aware, so almost all procurements are made off of a competitive procurement or a vehicle that was competitively procured. So we think that, clearly, we know we have to compete every day in this particular market, but you're also able to put features that will allow you to differentiate. And the fact that we've got a big installed base, and we work every day through our Services arm, our partners and our folks in the field, we continue to be very successful even given the competitive market.","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes, and Ben, I would add that from a competition standpoint, we believe we've held or gained market share globally. And more specifically, in the P25 market in North America, we believe we're gaining market share. One other quick comment, back to Brian, on FirstNet. I thought Mark did a great job answering that. We still believe in the U.S. that a dedicated spectrum model is clearly the way to go, and all the legislation and promulgation of rules reinforces that. The uniqueness of public safety around talk groups and one-to-many and a whole host of other reasons of why it's very different than a commercial, a carrier network is important to note. And so we don't see a commercial network a competitive alternative in the states for a long time. I mean, mission-critical voice, as an example, is not even contemplated in the current 3GPP standards. So we continue to work closely with FirstNet. The relationship has gotten better. We're making progress at LA-RICS, and we'll see how it goes. But we've been measured in our expectations as we model the business around Public Safety LTE, around the revenue I earlier commented on a few minutes ago.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","And a follow-up question. When you look at your state and local municipal business, can you talk a little bit about how -- what type of sentiment you see from those customers into next year? Do they see any changes for their funding sources? Or have you seen any deviation? And then one housekeeping, how much of the $200 million in cost savings in '14 comes from the reversal of the accrued comp?","Mark F. Moon","So from state and local perspective, really, the funding that we have traditionally seen has remained fairly consistent. The level of federal grants has remained consistent. And when you think about state and local municipalities, a big piece of their purchases are made through their own funding. As we mentioned, I think more than funding, the fact of the purchasing cycles were really driven by the acceleration calls from narrowbanding in North America with the state and local customers. But our activities, as Greg stated earlier, particularly in North America, have continued to improve. We see North America business continuing to improve. We said at the last call, our pipeline from the second half was up $1 billion over the first half. That continues to remain consistent and positive. So we get good sentiment from the customers around both the need for mission-critical communications and the prospects of Motorola being able to earn that business.","Gino A. Bonanotte","And Ben, on the variable pay question, of the $200 million plus, approximately $50 million is related to variable pay year-over-year.","Operator","I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks.

Mr. Kutsor, you may begin your conference.","Chris Kutsor - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to our 2018 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President & CFO; Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President, Products & Sales; and Kelly Mark, Executive Vice President, Services & Software.

Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Chris, good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll now share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. First, Q3 was another strong quarter. We grew revenue 13%, grew EPS 27%, and generated more cash compared to last year on continued strength in both segments.","Second, I'm encouraged with our continued backlog growth, which is up over $0.5 billion compared to last year, and now sits at a Q3 record ending $9.5 billion, and does not yet include over $2 billion of expected backlog, related to the Airwave and ESN extensions, or the State of Florida award.","And finally, based on our Q3 performance, we're raising our earnings outlook again for the full year. We now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $7 to $7.05.","I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 results and outlook, before returning for some closing thoughts.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Greg. Q3 includes revenue of $1.9 billion, up 13% from last year, including $145 million of revenue from acquisitions, and $19 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 4% in constant currency. GAAP operating earnings were $294 million, down $53 million from last year, due to an increase to a legacy environmental reserve. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $452 million, up $40 million, or 10% from the year-ago quarter on higher revenue. Operating margins were 24.3% of sales, down 70 basis points from last year, due to acquisitions.","GAAP earnings per share were $1.43, up 14% from $1.25 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was up $1.94, up 27% from $1.53 last year on higher revenue and earnings, as well as a lower tax rate. Ending backlog was $9.5 billion, a Q3 record, and was up $572 million, or 6% compared to last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $277 million, or 9%, and Services and Software backlog was up $295 million, or 5%.","Q3 Products and Systems Integration revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10%, primarily on acquisitions and organic growth in North America. Q3 Products and SI operating earnings were $276 million, or 21.4% of sales, down 290 basis points from last year, primarily on higher OpEx related to acquisitions and lower gross margins associated with systems integration on a few large projects.","We expect full-year 2018 operating margins for the segment to be approximately 21%. Products and SI segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.3 billion, up $277 million, or 9% versus last year, with growth in all regions. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $118 million, or 4%.","Q3 Services and Software revenue was $574 million, up $103 million, or 22% from last year, with growth in every region. This includes $49 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating earnings were $176 million, or 30.7% of sales, up 370 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and favorable gross margin mix.","We expect full-year 2018 operating margins for the segment to be approximately 28%, and continue to expect full-year 2019 margins of approximately 30%. Services and Software backlog ended at $6.2 billion, up $295 million, or 5% versus last year, driven by the Americas and Asia-Pac. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog is down 1%, including approximately $135 million of Airwave revenue recognition.","Total OpEx in Q3 was $464 million, up $78 million from the year-ago quarter, due to acquisitions and ASC 606. For the full year, we continue to expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion.","Other income and expense was $43 million, compared to $41 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $59 million, compared to $52 million a year ago. The Q3 effective tax rate was 18% compared to 30% last year, due to 2017 tax reform, return to provision adjustments booked in the quarter, and tax benefits related to share-based compensation.","Turning to cash flow, Q3 operating cash flow was $338 million, compared to $270 million last year. The increase was driven by higher earnings and improved working capital. We continue to expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year, excluding the $500 million pension contribution in Q1.","Free cash flow was $292 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $39 million compared with last year on lower spending in IT and real estate. Additionally, we repurchased 20% of the Silver Lake convertible note for $369 million. The $200 million of principal was repaid in early Q4 with new senior unsecured debt, and the $169 million conversion premium was paid with cash in Q3.","We also fully repaid the remaining $300 million revolving credit facility associated with the Avigilon acquisition, $200 million was repaid during the quarter, and $100 million was paid subsequent to quarter-end. Additionally, we currently expect to repay the $400 million bank term loan associated with the Avigilon acquisition in 2019.","Looking at regional results, Americas revenue was up 16% and growth in both segments. The region saw strong demand for LMR products and services, command center software, and video solutions. Q3 backlog is up approximately $480 million year-over-year. EMEA revenue was up 12% and was also driven by growth in both segments. Q3 backlog is down approximately $100 million compared to last year, inclusive of over $500 million of Airwave revenue recognition. And in Asia-Pac, revenue was down 1%, with growth in Services and Software offset by Products and SI. Backlog is up approximately $200 million.","Turning to our outlook, we expect Q4 sales to be up approximately 13%, with non-GAAP EPS between $2.50 and $2.55. This assumes $25 million of FX headwinds at current rates, a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares, and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue growth of approximately 14.5%.","We now expect non-GAAP EPS of $7.00 to $7.05, up from $6.79 to $6.89. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22.5%. Our guidance reflects an expectation of minimal impacts from tariffs, given our very limited exposure to China.","Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. During the quarter, we were awarded a contract valued at over $50 million to replace an existing TETRA network in Europe; a $21 million P25 network and device order from the City of Indianapolis and Marion County, Indiana; an $18 million order from Chesterfield County in Virginia to upgrade our computer-aided dispatch and records management solution, providing a unified experience across emergency call handling, command and control, and management \u2013 the management of records and evidence; and a $19 million 10-year contract from the City of Las Vegas for our CommandCentral Vault digital evidence management solution. CommandCentral Vault integrates with our customers' existing software applications for computer-aided dispatch and records management, and now consolidates evidence and content from a wide variety of sources into a single platform.","I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","And thanks, Gino. Let me close with a few thoughts. First, I'm very pleased with our Q3 results that were led by North America. We see strong demand across land mobile radio products, services and software, and the Avigilon acquisition continues to perform ahead of our expectations.","Second, I like our momentum in the Services and Software segment. Q3 was another strong quarter for our Services business as well, and we're seeing continued traction with recent command center wins that highlight the power of our end-to-end software suite. And while there's more work to do, I remain excited about the recurring revenue, margin expansion, and earnings potential of this segment going forward.","And finally, as I look ahead, I feel good about our competitive position. We have a compelling portfolio serving vibrant segments of large addressable markets. We have a strong team focused on consistent execution, a healthy balance sheet, and durable growing cash flows that provide flexibility for continued shareholder returns.","I'll now turn the call back over to Chris.","Chris Kutsor - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and a follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many people as possible.","Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Thank you. Our first question is coming from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks a lot, guys. Hey, I wanted to maybe start off by looking at the Q4 guidance. If I look at your revenue guidance, the tax rate, shares, earnings, seems to imply something like a 28% operating margin. And as I look back to a year ago or even two years ago, you guys were operating at somewhat higher operating margins in Q4. I get it. It's a seasonally strong quarter, but can you walk through kind of where that operating margin kind of math looks in your eyes? Is that 28% number about right? And then is it conservatism, or is it some of the costs you're carrying with some of these M&A deals? Just kind of talk through profitability there, that would be helpful. Thanks.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, George, this is Gino. That looks about right, and I'll remind you that at the acquisitions, operating margin percentage is down obviously. Earnings are up, it's related to acquisitions and a little bit of ASC 606 as well.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Okay. Got it. And then on the tax rate, we kind of talked about it, a little bit higher tax rate than you guys put up certainly here in Q4, and then I think maybe even your modeling for Q3 and then what you're modeling for Q4. Can you just talk about kind of what's going on in tax rate and how you see the outlook there going forward? Thanks.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. So, from a tax rate perspective, maybe it's instructive to start with Q3. So Q3, 18% versus 30% last year. About half of that, George, is related to the tax legislation. The other half is split between return to provision estimate and deemed dividends and stock compensation. So as we look forward, we guided the 22.5% ETR for the full year, and as we look into next year a little bit, the tax rate, our expectation is somewhere 24% to 25%. So, Q3 was a little bit lower rate based on those couple of items.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Great. Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks and good evening. I just wanted to start, first acknowledge that Q3 profit dollar growth was still very solid, but non-GAAP OpEx is growing faster than gross profit dollars, and guidance suggests this will continue. Maybe you could just talk about the drivers to this and how you think about the timing to reverse this trend. It sounds like there's some leverage on operating margin in Services and Software, but maybe touch on Products margin as well, since it looks like that's where the margins have been declining. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Adam, this is Gino. So we'll start from an OpEx perspective. Really, the increase is related to acquisitions. There's also a little bit of the ASC 606, but it's acquisition-related, and clearly, as we continue to grow revenue in those acquisitions, that will offset the incremental OpEx. The base business, the expectations haven't changed from the beginning of the year. We continue to drive cost reductions frankly in the base business, offset by increases in OpEx.","From a \u2013 the second part of the question was operating margin for PS&I (sic) [P&SI] (17:38). Yeah, so the way to think about PS&I (sic) [P&SI] (17:42) is obviously PS&I (sic) [P&SI] (17:44) now includes Systems Integration, and it also includes some of the acquisitions and the additional costs in the acquisitions, both from a [ph] VGM (17:55) perspective, and frankly, from a gross margin perspective as well based on current volumes. So we do expect PS&I (sic) [P&SI] (18:03) gross margin to expand, and we expect to end the year \u2013 I think I mentioned in my prior comments \u2013 to end the year at approximately 21%. We expect that to expand anywhere between 100 and 200 basis points in 2019.","Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, Greg, I wanted to ask a little bit more on Software. How integrated is that business into the rest of the company? I know you've got some new segmentation, would imagine there's some separation there, and if the market's not giving you credit for it, would you think about strategic optionality, whether that's an IPO or a sale or something like that?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","No, I think, Adam, it's pretty integrated with our business. And I think it's \u2013 I think of the Software and I think about the critical importance driven by command center software. So, I think of three legs of the stool, I think of our land mobile radio business, I think of our command center software business, and I think of our video business through Avigilon, and then services that integrate or wrap around all three.","So as we've said, that segment is pretty much a proxy for recurring revenue of the firm. I think Andrew Sinclair on the Software side, Kelly obviously inherits now the entire segment with Bruce Brda's retirement. I feel good about this segment and its integration and interrelatedness with our business as a whole, and you saw the strong performance in Q3, and as Gino talked about, I think there's gross margin and operating margin expansion for sure in 2019, and quite frankly, beyond. So, I think it's a very key part of our strategy, and I think about it in an integrated way from a company perspective.","Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it, thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good evening, gentlemen. Thanks for the opportunity to get a question here. Just as we think about Avigilon, it's been in your hands now about six months, two quarters and plus some, just thoughts on how that business is progressing. Obviously there's been some challenges within the Chinese competitors, given there's a lot of (20:13) competitive advantage, but a little bit color on how that business is doing, and thoughts about it going forward.","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Okay. Keith, It's Jack. So in terms of Avigilon, obviously we announced the acquisition in early February this year, through two quarters, a little bit more than two quarters of business, frankly has exceeded our expectations. So the market's about $12 billion ex-China, which has been growing at a 5% growth rate. We're essentially tripling that growth rate in the market. We are making investments in go-to-market, and continue to make investments in the portfolio as well, and we see continued leverage and growth for that business into 2019. So it's performing very well.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","And I'd add that \u2013 especially with the recent legislation around the National Defense Authorization Act, that prohibits the procurement of Chinese content with video surveillance, specifically Hikvision and Dahua, the opportunity is even greater than we've originally thought, I think, both for the Federal market, for sure, and we haven't had any traction, so to speak, given the sales cycle on state and local. So I'm pleased with the way Jack is running it. Remember, we're operating it as a fully contained subsidiary, but it's also important to note we're investing. We're investing in go-to-market distribution, and we're investing in development to further extend our portfolio and product lead. Feel very good about that acquisition.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. All right, just for a follow-up to change gears slightly here for the ESN, how should we think about the ESN and when you might be able to monetize that? Is there anything that we can look at as factors about when it will start?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","So we still anticipate signing a contract for Airwave, ESN extensions. We're targeting by the end of the year. I mentioned that in my backlog comment. None of that is \u2013 the extension piece are not reflected in backlog. Airwave is about \u2013 and I know you talked about ESN, but just to put a marker down, Airwave is about $1.45 billion through that three-year extension. And ESN, the extension, what they call the CAN Agreement (22:38), would be signed at the same time.","I think our expectations for ESN specifically, which is your question, is reasonably modest for 2019. I think it will take some traction to get utilization and final definition and agreement, but the Airwave extension is pretty cut and dry and clear for that three-year monetization of $1.45 billion. A lot of great work by the team here with the UK Home Office. Feel good about both of those deals.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.","Joshua Kehoe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, this is Josh Kehoe on for Jim. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you provide some more detail on what drove the year-over-year growth in Americas and EMEA? And are you seeing any heightened competitive pressure in APAC?","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Okay, Josh. So, obviously, for the Americas, continued, really it's across the board. I mean, great performance in both Product (sic) [Products] (23:40) and SI. We've grown and that's the LMR portfolio both to the government and commercial space, as well as Avigilon. And then the Software and the Services business, really that North America's the anchor point of that business, and it performed very well in Q3, really it's performed very well all year. So obviously, backlog is up 9% there, but good traction in the Americas. In EMEA, it's really been the story of Avigilon, and then the Products and Systems Integration, they're up as well. So pretty balanced story in both of our largest theaters really.","And Asia-Pac, frankly, the business has performed. We've grown in Asia-Pac this year. In fact, we plan to grow every theater that we operate within, but we've had some pressure in China, frankly, but I would remind everybody that our largest business in Asia-Pac is Australia. Australia performs exceptionally well for us. Australia, in fact, is really, frankly, more than twice as big as China for us in the region. That's our anchor tenancy in Asia-Pac, and so a little bit of competition in China and the surrounding area, but frankly, we continue to perform well in Asia-Pac as well.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, and I think that's the key. I think our Asia-Pac strategy is led largely by Australia. As it relates to China, and as anticipated, it's not really significant against the overall composition of the firm. China represents about 2% of our overall revenue. We have about 170 employees in Mainland China, and as a part of a very concerted multiyear effort, we do not do manufacturing in China. We don't do product development. It is more about sales and sales support and go-to-market distribution.","Joshua Kehoe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And are you seeing any change in the duration of your backlog? Thanks.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","No, Josh. This is Gino. No change to the duration of our backlog as we began offering the service \u2013 multiyear service offering. So we did see a little bit of a duration extension in Services, as that represented revenue that would be realized over multiple years. But no change certainly in 2018 to our expectation of the duration of backlog in either Products and Systems Integration, or in Services and Software.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hey, good afternoon, Gino and Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","How are you?","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","My question's on \u2013 I had just a bigger picture question. The software Command\/Control in the context of managed services and also the Avigilon business are clearly the pillars or the drivers of growth heading into next year and over the next few years. So give us just some qualitative lens of how should we think of these two important growth drivers as we head into the new year. Thanks.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, actually, I think we're growing across pretty much all of our platforms. You talked about Software and Services and Avigilon, but I'm very pleased with the land mobile radio business as well. Look, we're not going to guide specifically on 2019, but the way we think about it currently is the segment of Product (sic) [Products] (27:11) and Systems Integration is generally a low-single-digit revenue growth business. Services and Software, all-in, is a high-single-digit business.","And our current thinking, I feel very good about our momentum, feel very good about our record Q3 backlog, but our current thinking is organic revenue growth constant currency next year can be comparable to this year. And that's with about $80 million of FX headwinds for next year, and that current thinking also contemplates no meaningful FirstNet revenue contribution next year.","Now, having said that, from a linearity standpoint, we always have Q1 being much lighter than normal, as we look at the full year, and I think that that kind of performance for 2019 will be comparable to 2018. But that's our current thinking.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Very helpful. A quick follow-on for...","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Vijay, this is Gino. Just very quickly, the preponderance of that FX headwind is in the first half next year.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Good point.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Gino, a quick follow-on on how should we think and what's your thought process on OpEx as percentage of revenue once again heading into next year? Thanks.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, so Vijay, I'm not sure we're going to guide on all the elements of 2019, but I think you can expect more of the same. As Jack and Greg both mentioned, investments in the acquisition, specifically in Avigilon in terms of go-to-market and in terms of R&D, but you can continue to expect very rigorous and disciplined attention to OpEx as we go forward into 2019. And on the next call, we'll give you a more detailed view of what 2019 looks like.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Vijay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. Couple of picayune ones, please. Amongst the pro forma adjustments, there's an environmental reserve expense, I see that some other charge number jumps this quarter. Is this something that we'll see more of? Perhaps you can just give us some sense of what this is about and characterize it (29:41)?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, Paul, this is Gino. No, you should not expect to see any more. This is a longstanding EPA site related to one of our legacy businesses in Scottsdale, Arizona. And really, what it represents is, if you look at the $57 million, about $20 million is additive costs, but from a cost perspective per year in 2019, the additive cost is about $800,000. So the cost is really related to an extension beyond 2039 of monitoring that we need to do in Scottsdale, both groundwater and vapor intrusion monitoring.","And then there's also a change in the discount rate that we used. So from a cash perspective, you shouldn't expect any different cash-out position anywhere in the near term, and certainly we don't expect any additional reserves on this particular item going forward.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, got it. And then we got this $25 million quarter of reorganization charges. So I think that was in both 2Q and 3Q. How long does this go on for? Why should we consider it sort of one-time in nature rather than an ongoing expense?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, it's really related to restructuring, Paul, and certainly we don't expect, for the organizations that we restructured, we don't expect that to recur again. So that's why it's in the column (31:28).","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So that's done. So we shouldn't see that again after this point?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. Certainly, I mean there may be other restructuring we may do, but certainly not the restructuring that we did in Q2 and Q3.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you very much. That's helpful.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Certainly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Just wanted to ask on the LMR business, just a two-parter there and then a follow-on for Gino. Just, the Florida deal was obviously a large one. Any other big deals out there that are being contemplated at this time? And related to that, any \u2013 I think in the past quarter or two, you've talked about some new product launches or opportunities in the LMR area, any comments on that? And then just follow-on for Gino, as we continue to move to a little bit more Software here, when should we start to see a little bit more inflection or improvement in the gross margin line? Thank you.","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Hey, Tim, it's Jack. I'll take the first one and then pass the baton to Gino. So first of all, I think the first part of the question was related to big deals. Obviously, in Greg's intro, we talked about the State of Florida, which is frankly the biggest state-wide project. It was a legacy Harris customer that we've been awarded. So we have that and we have multiple other state-wide upgrades that we're in pursuit of.","The LMR project business remains, frankly, it's very robust. I would tether that comment to the fact that the team's executed very well with the portfolio that we've got a couple new product introductions. We have not announced the new product yet, but both from a command center software, we've got a lot on the horizon there, but also some nice things here in 2019 related to our devices as well. So, the sales team is very poised, very excited to take that to market. But so I think the culmination of the market drivers, state and local revenue receipts being up, very good Federal budget situation for us, coupled with new product on the horizon, it's exciting times, I think, in the Project 25 and PCR business.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","And Tim, this is Gino. On gross margin, the question was specific to Services and Software, is that correct?","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yes. Yeah, it's kind of just overall, but, yeah, particularly in \u2013 as that mix improves, how do we think about (34:06)...","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure. So let me start with Services and Software. We clearly expect gross margin expansion in 2018 versus last year, 250 basis points. And we expect continued expansion into 2019. We talked about our expectation for operating margin to be approximately 30% in 2019 versus 28% in 2018.

Mr. Kutsor, you may begin your conference.","Chris Kutsor - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you and good afternoon. Welcome to our 2017 third quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President and CFO; Bruce Brda, Executive Vice President, Products and Solutions; and Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Service. Greg and Gino will review our results along with commentary, and Bruce and Jack will join for Q&A.","We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com\/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call, in the risk factors section of our 2016 annual reports on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.","And with that I'll now turn it over to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize all of the men and women in public safety. First responders work hard every day to serve and protect our communities, and their critical importance was exemplified during the recent natural disasters. We're dedicated to helping our customers to be their best in the moments that matter. So I'd also like to thank all of our employees for their role in assisting public safety to ensure that mission-critical communications remained operational during these extreme events over the last few months.","With that, I turn to quarterly results and share a few thoughts about the business. First, Q3 was another outstanding quarter, driven by strong sales growth in our Land Mobile Radio business. Total revenue grew 7%. Organic revenue grew 5%. Organic revenue in North America also grew 5% and we grew organically in every region. These results reflect the continued customer demand for always-on, private, secure, reliable and redundant mission-critical voice communications.","Second, we're raising our full-year outlook again for both revenue and EPS on continued LMR demand and execution, led by North America. We now expect full-year 2017 revenue growth of approximately 5% and non-GAAP EPS of $5.35 to $5.40. And finally, I'm especially pleased with our momentum heading into Q4 and into 2018. Not only have we grown revenues 6% year-to-date, but we also finished Q3 with record backlog. The primary driver of growth is continued strong demand in North America, which has year-to-date revenue growth of 4% and ending backlog up over $1 billion from a year ago. Considering that many of our systems typically last 10 to 20 years, this demand is a testament to the criticality and longevity of our LMR business.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q3 results and outlook before returning for some closing thoughts.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Greg. Q3 results include revenue of $1.6 billion, up 7% versus last year, including approximately $40 million of revenue from acquisitions. Organic revenue was up 5%.","GAAP operating earnings of $338 million, down $3 million from last year, non-GAAP operating earnings were $423 million, up 7% or $27 million from the prior year. Operating margins were 25.7% of sales, comparable to last year. GAAP earnings per share was $1.25, up 11% from $1.13 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.53, up 12% from $1.37 last year.","Ending backlog was $8.9 billion, up $768 million from last year. Product backlog was up $344 million and Services backlog was up $424 million. For the remainder of the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted.","Q3 product sales were $989 million, up 8% from last year, led by North America and EMEA on continued demand for P25 systems for both public safety and commercial customers.","Q3 Product segment operating income was $287 million or 29% of sales, up 260 basis points from last year, driven primarily by higher sales and lower OpEx. Gross margins were flat compared to the prior year.","Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.8 billion, up $344 million or 24% versus last year. This is the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sequentially, Products backlog was up $203 million or 13%. The year-over-year and sequential backlog growth continues to be driven by North America, which had 13 P25 system orders valued at over $10 million each.","Turning to Services; Q3 services revenue was $656 million, up 7% from last year. Our Managed & Support services revenue grew 8%. Services operating income was $136 million or 20.7% of sales, down from 25% last year. As expected, gross margins returned to the mid-30s from the high 30s in the year ago quarter. As previously noted, we continue to expect gross margins in the mid-30% range for the Services segment. Additionally, OpEx was up $10 million in the segment, primarily as a result of acquisitions.","Services backlog ended at $7.1 billion, up $424 million or 6% from last year, including approximately $400 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $228 million, including $116 million of favorable currency adjustments. Services backlog continues to be driven primarily by North America demand for long-term Managed & Support services contract.","Moving to operating expenses; total OpEx from continuing operations was $375 million, up $5 million from the year-ago quarter, inclusive of $12 million related to acquisitions. Other income and expense was $52 million compared to $48 million in the year-ago quarter. The Q3 effective tax rate was 29.9%.","Turning to cash flow; Q3 operating cash flow was $270 million, a decrease of $78 million from last year, driven by higher working capital associated with the ERP implementation and higher tax payments. Free cash flow was $185 million, a decrease of $95 million from last year. From a trailing 12-month perspective, free cash flow was up $20 million. We expect approximately $1.2 billion in operating cash flow for 2017.","We ended Q3 with cash of $717 million and a net debt position of $3.8 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $100 million of stock at an average price of $87.54 and we paid dividends of $76 million. Additionally, we paid $205 million in cash related to the acquisition of Kodiak. Today, we also announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of 11% to $0.52 per share.","Turning to our outlook; we are raising our Q4 and full-year guidance. We expect Q4 revenue growth of approximately 3% with non-GAAP EPS between $2 and $2.05. We now expect full-year 2017 revenue growth of approximately 5% versus our previous forecast of 3% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $5.35 to $5.40, an increase from the prior outlook of $5.20 to $5.30. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 169 million shares.","Full-year operating expenses are expected to be $1.48 billion, down approximately $15 million from 2016, including approximately $45 million of OpEx from acquisitions. We expect the full-year 2017 effective tax rate to be approximately 32% and operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion for the year.","Looking at regional results; Americas revenue was up 9%, driven by organic growth of 5% in North America. This growth was driven by strong demand for P25 Products and Services, as well as demand for PCR products, serving commercial customers. Backlog is also up more than $1.2 billion year-over-year and up more than $500 million sequentially, as customers continue to invest in LMR solutions for the long term.","EMEA was up 6% on strong demand in products, while backlog was down from the Airwave revenue conversion. Asia Pac was up 1%, primarily driven by Services. Finally, I'd like to end with some notable segment highlights. In our Products segment, we won several deals that include a $79 million award to deploy a P25 system for three counties in the State of Oregon; a $54 million award for a P25 system in Memphis, Tennessee; and a $24 million award for a P25 system in Burlington, New Jersey.","In our Services segment, we were awarded three new Managed & Support contracts that extend support for P25 networks through the year 2028. These include a $26 million support contract in the Phoenix area, a $12 million contract for Stafford County, Virginia and a $10 million regional contract in Georgia.","Additionally, from a technology perspective, we introduced the PSX Application Suite, providing push-to-talk, messaging and mapping applications designed specifically for public safety LTE users. We announced responder alert, technology that triggers automatic alerts to the command center for events such as weapon drawn or fired.","The Motorola Public Safety LTE LEX F10 handset and the VML 750 vehicular modem were added to the FirstNet.com website and AT&T's speed portal. And finally, we closed the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, which provides push-to-talk over cellular solutions in North America, Latin America and Europe for customers such as AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, Bell Canada and Telef\u00f3nica.","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Gino. Let me just close with three final thoughts. First, we raised our full-year revenue and EPS forecast again. Our customers continue to require always-on voice communication for mission-critical situations and that was reinforced by the reliability of our systems during the recent U.S. hurricanes.","Second, I'm confident with our strategic position. We're leveraging our LMR systems installed base to attach incremental services, while simultaneously building complementary platforms for the command center and public safety LTE, which together provide the foundation for continued growth, continued cash generation and continued earnings expansion and shareholder return over the long term. And finally, with our record-ending backlog, I think we're very well positioned for continued growth heading into 2018.","I'll now turn the call back over to Chris.","Chris Kutsor - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I would like to remind callers please limit themselves to one question and one follow-up so we can get as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers how to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Our first question is coming from Matthew Cabral with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you. Greg, I wanted to pick up on the last comment from your prepared remarks. Clearly, it's been a year of good momentum so far. But as we started thinking about going forward in 2018, just wondering if you can comment a little bit more about the sustainability of organic growth and just what you see as the biggest drivers behind that?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes. I think that I'm really pleased, Matt, with our performance in Q3. It's our fourth consecutive quarter of organic growth as a company. As you know, 65% of our revenue is North America-based. So when I look at that, and I see that they've grown nine out of the last 11 quarters, I feel good about the ending backlog and I feel good about the foundation that we have to build on heading into next year.","I think overall demand remains strong. It's been strong in North America. We've grown organically, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, in all regions. I think we've also seen strength in commercial markets, as well as state and local and federal. And quite frankly, I think overall, our execution and sales coverage is stronger than it was a year ago or 18 months ago. We do expect to grow in 2018 and we expect to grow organically in 2018. So \u2013 and that's with iDEN to be approximately down $20 million in 2018.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just quickly on FirstNet. So I think we're up to 28 states now that have opted in. Just wondering if at this point there's any incremental commentary that you have in the ramp and how we should think about the announcement that Verizon made in August and just where that fits into the picture more broadly?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes. I don't think there's any real change that we have to update you on at this point in time. I think there's 28 or 29 states and territories that have opted in. We're encouraged by that. We think that's great. All the states have, as you know, Matt, till December 28 to make the decision of whether they opt-in or opt-out. Now that said, once that's all behind us, then the rubber meets the road on end-user decisions, decisions by city, municipality, county, state and the individual decisions of whether they switch to their existing carrier because it's a carrier-to-carrier switch and what they do.","And we'll work with our partner, AT&T, to see how much traction we can get in that regard. The only other thing I'd say on the Verizon front, they're going to do what they're going to do, but we closed on the acquisition of Kodiak. Verizon uses Kodiak as a push-to-talk solution today. So we now have entre working with Verizon on that front. But I think we'll have a better update for you on the Q4 earnings call around FirstNet and our view in terms of fiscal 2018 financially.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stanley Kovler with Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Stanley Kovler - Citi","Thanks very much. Just a question on FirstNet and taking a slightly different angle on sort of the conversations you're having with customers, and is that having some effect at the field level with respect to sales cycles, do you get the sense that these deals that you're getting now, are customers essentially trying to lock in deals because of planning for FirstNet, or is it the opposite that there could be, in some cases, some push-outs? And then I have a follow-up for Gino. Thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, I don't think \u2013 as we've said all along, I think it's been demonstrated in our results and what we see happening in the market, LTE is a data and broadband overlay network that's incremental to LMR. I don't think there's any change in buying pattern in LMR as a result of FirstNet. I think it's an adjunct activity that's going on in parallel. I mean, today Governor Wolf signed Pennsylvania to opt-in. Just a few quarters ago, we won back competitively the State of Pennsylvania for a land mobile radio network that will include an end-to-end system and several years of multi-year maintenance. So, I don't think the two meet.","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes. Stanley, it's Jack. Maybe to piggyback on what Greg said. Just this afternoon, I met with a customer from Halton, Canada, who just recently secured a private LTE network for Motorola. Interestingly enough, just 10 months ago, they signed an eight-year SUA in a P25 network that they procured just three years ago.","So I think you'll see parallel paths, P25 will continue to be the mission-critical voice solution for our customer base. As Greg alluded to, hasn't slowed any discussions, hasn't slowed cycles.","In fact, we closed 13 deals over $15 million, as Gino alluded to. In the conversation I had with Halton today was really around next-generation applications, mobile intelligence, how you ultimately link command center intelligence, which plays into the investments we're making there to making officers more efficient and optimize what they do from an intelligence perspective in the field. Think about moving records, CAD, those kinds of things into the field more seamlessly. So really it hasn't slowed, but we think there's a real good story on both ends in parallel path.","Stanley Kovler - Citi","Thanks. And just a clarification for Gino on the outlook. Can you give us a sense of how much FX tailwind we should think about for Q4 and then the full fiscal year and then just a sense for the now fiscal year 2017 organic growth embedded in that approximately 5% number? Thank you.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure, Stanley. I'll start with full year organic growth. Embedded in that number is organic growth of between 2% and 3% and that includes iDEN down $45 million in 2017. With respect to FX for the full year, it's de minimis. It's a push for the quarter based on rates right now approximately $20 million to $25 million in the Q4 \u2013 in our Q4 number.","Stanley Kovler - Citi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, Greg, Gino.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Hey, Vijay. How are you?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Hey. Vijay.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Andrew Sinclair, whom I know from Microsoft, is building an attractive software franchise at MSI. So I'd like to get your view, Greg, on how the software business and portfolio could start water-falling and impact the numbers into the new year. And then in state and local, we've seen recent hurricane events. Would those be near-term product cycle catalysts? Thanks.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. On the second part first, we're really proud of the performance of our LMR systems during the hurricane season. That's why we demonstrated as one of the slides in that deck this time of the systems in Florida hit by Irma of the ones we monitor, how they stayed up.","The communications stayed up, all the systems stayed up. It's pretty noteworthy and significant. By the way, the Q3 print really didn't have anything material at all as it relates to hurricanes.","I think the opportunity for future add-on business or rebuild exists going forward, but the strength of Q3 was more around the fundamental core demand of what we're seeing, state and local, commercial, Federal, North America-led.","Andrew Sinclair, really happy with the hire. You know that we're moving more toward software and services. Recurring revs \u2013 Services were 40% of our overall revenue in Q3. Recurring revenue was 27% of our revenue in Q3, and we've said that we will play a greater role in the command center. We've made acquisitions that reflect that stated strategy. We still anticipate closing Airbus PlantCML by the end of the year, but I think Andrew has hit the ground running.","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","And Vijay, this is Bruce Brda. Just to add a little bit. Let me remind you, the investments in software are both in the command center, as Jack said. So think workflow applications, 911, CAD, records, Dispatch Console, with an analytics wrapper around it; and then, secondarily communication and collaboration applications, so what we're delivering to FirstNet and other broadband customers around the world.","Increasingly, we'll be delivering those solutions cloud-based and as a service. As you mentioned Andrew, we've also added a couple of other senior leaders to Andrew's team and are making really good progress as we start to integrate those individual software applications into a true suite that we can deliver to the command center.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Kyle McNealy - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. This is Kyle here for George. It was a seasonally strong Q3. I know Q4 is always your biggest quarter. It doesn't look like it from your guide, but I'm just wondering if there's any \u2013 if there was any pull-forward that you saw into Q3 for any reason across your customers?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Kyle, I think the best way to look at it is to take Q3 and Q4 and look at the second half in combination. I think that's reflected a bit in our guide. We still do expect to grow organically in Q4 this year, which would make it five quarters in a row. The only other thing I could mention to you is, Q4 last year was a monster. It was 12% revenue growth. So the year-on-year compare needs to be incorporated into that. Organic growth of Q4 last year was 4%.","So that's part of it, and embedded in that is Latin America that grew 21% last Q4 and a public safety LTE project in the Middle East that's winding down. That's down about $30 million year-over-year. So I think that's the way to dimensionalize and contextualize the guidance. But I would point you to really Q3 and Q4, and look at them in combination. And then the organic growth is more reflective of traditionally what this business has done in certain periods.","Kyle McNealy - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot. And are there any other comments you can add to \u2013 regarding the duration of backlog? Is it changing at all? And I know you mentioned the recurring revenue as a percent of sales in Q3. But just the combination of your recurring revs and total backlog, how much of that would be coming \u2013 getting converted in terms of what's expected with your guide for Q4?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I don't know the exact age backlog number, Kyle, but recurring revenue was up very slightly. I think the previous quarter was 26%. So it edges up a little bit to 27%. What we like in the backlog number is not only it being up, to your point, it's up in both Products and Services, and that Product backlog is up even in the face of an 8% print on Product revenue. So I would certainly think that, that backlog position, as I mentioned, bodes well for our performance in 2018. I don't have the age number on my fingertips for Q4.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Kyle, this is Gino. From a Q4 perspective, aged entering into the quarter, we are better aged entering Q4 than we were last year at the end of Q3. And you started the comment with Q4 not being the largest quarter. Q4 will still be our largest quarter. And if you look at it from a percentage perspective, from a linearity perspective, it's within a point or so of the normal linearity that we would experience during any particular year.","Kyle McNealy - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. That's very helpful. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks guys.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Kyle.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Kyle.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thanks for the opportunity. So, Greg, if you look at Kodiak, perhaps you can provide a little bit more color on that and help us understand a little bit more how that falls into your universe? I mean, is your customer the carrier themselves or is it the public safety agency? And I guess how is the billing for that done? Just trying to understand that a little bit more.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Just to remind you, when we contemplated the Kodiak acquisition, it was \u2013 for me, it was designed around a mid-tier solution, and quite frankly, it was more around commercial markets. And to have a carrier-centric, carrier-integrated solution in addition to our premises-based solution.","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","So, Keith, this is Bruce Brda. Just a couple of more comments. WAVE 7000 is really optimized around \u2013 as close as we can get broadband to LMR performance, so really performance-based, Kodiak carrier-integrated. So think of billing, provisioning, support systems, lawful intercept, all of those requirements driven by carriers. We sell the application to the carrier. They operate it. So we're actually paid dollars per sub per month, to the initial part of your question.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. Thanks. I appreciate that. And then just changing gears over to the Smart Public Safety Solutions, perhaps a little bit more color on how that's doing. Obviously, you guys had Spillman from the past few quarters now, the ability to combine that with your products. How is the growth going in that segment?","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","So, in terms of software enterprise, I made a couple of comments a moment ago about the focus. It's both command center and then communication and collaboration apps. Kodiak fits in the comms and collaboration apps that I just discussed.","The Spillman acquisition is going extremely well. It's been a highlight for us. We have generated the additional traction that we hope to get from our reach and, in fact, some cross-sell as well between ECW and Spillman as they serve largely the same tiers of the market, think of Tier 3 and Tier 2, for command centers.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Can we just get an update on what's going on over in the U.K. with both the Home Office and Airwave? And related to that, if you could just update us on kind of pipeline or what you're seeing for other large potential public safety LTE deals out there? Is there any more momentum growing in the international markets? Thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, Tim. Thanks for the question. We continue to work very closely with both actually the U.K. Home Office and EE on \u2013 it's a complex project. I mean, it's a one of a kind. So we're working closely with them. You've seen public announcements where they have kind of resized and re-estimated the timeline in that regard. I remind you that we don't have any revenue associated with ESN or the UK Home Office in 2017. That's one of the reasons why when we think about our LTE revenues for the full year in 2017, they're probably closer to $80 million to $90 million this fiscal year than what we thought would be a higher number given to some of the ESN replan work. We continue to work closely with them. Bruce Brda, as you would imagine, has a whole team dedicated to them, and we're working closely accordingly shoulder to shoulder.","In terms of other demand, anecdotally, Molloy mentioned Halton, Canada, while small, I think it's symbolic since they just purchased an LMR system a few quarters ago. There's also an LTE Asia Pac customer that I think will make a decision probably in Q1 and it's more in the tens of millions of dollars than the size of some of our other previous awards. But that's really the only next one on the horizon that comes to mind. I think it will be first three or four months in 2018. And I think generally speaking, we're working hard and well positioned.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And just a follow-up, are you seeing the same LMR successes that you're seeing in the U.S., are you seeing the international markets still strong on the LMR systems?","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Hey, Tim, it's Jack. We are. In fact, if I think about every continent, we've got opportunities, large-scale opportunities in the Middle East, in Africa and Asia Pac as well. Outside the U.S., we've got big both TETRA and P25 opportunities in every region of the world right now.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Chris Kutsor, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks.","Chris Kutsor - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I think that will do it.

These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. It's important to review these materials.","A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation. Forward-looking statements are any statements that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of Motorola Solutions, and we can give no assurance that any future results or events discussed in these statements will be achieved.","Any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements contained in this presentation.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown","Thanks, Shep. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Q4 was another great quarter for Motorola Solutions. These quarterly results capped another very strong year for our company. 2012 marked a number of key accomplishments: solid sales growth, operating earnings expansion and double-digit EPS growth, strong cash flow and significant capital return to our shareholders.","Q4 highlights included record sales and operating earnings, continued leadership and innovation with new product launches and the acquisition of Psion. This morning, we reported fourth quarter sales of $2.4 billion, an increase of 6% from Q4 of last year. On a GAAP basis, net earnings from continuing operations were $1.18 per share compared to $0.54 in the year-ago quarter.","Non-GAAP net earnings from continuing ops were $1.10 per share compared to $0.87 per share in Q4 of last year, a 26% increase. For the full year, we posted revenue growth of approximately 6% while increasing non-GAAP operating earnings by 9%. For the remainder of the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise noted.","Our Government business revenues increased 10% for the quarter. We saw strength across the portfolio, driven by double-digit growth in ASTRO and TETRA. Government sales increased 12% for the full year. Our growth was driven by a number of factors including the analog-to-digital transition, aging public safety infrastructure, U.S. narrowbanding and our broadest and most competitive portfolio ever.","In our Enterprise business, sales decreased 3% from the year-ago quarter, including the anticipated decline in iDEN. On a full year basis, Enterprise revenue declined 5% as many large customers postponed deployments in the face of soft economic conditions and uncertainty. We do believe that the challenges in this segment were more cyclical than structural.","I'll now turn it over to Ed to discuss our financial results in more detail, then I'll return to discuss operational highlights and provide additional thoughts on our business performance.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Thanks, Greg. Q4 sales grew 6%, in line with our expectations. This marks yet another quarter of improved operating leverage as our disciplined cost management and targeted investments continued to yield operating margin expansion. On a full year basis, revenue grew 6% to $8.7 billion, while operating earnings as a percent of revenue was 17.3%. This represents a 9% increase in operating earnings from 2011. EPS in the fourth quarter was $1.10, which represents a 26% increase. For the full year, we delivered a 23% increase in earnings per share.","In Government, we continue to see robust growth as fourth quarter sales totaled $1.7 billion, an increase of 10% from the prior quarter. 2012 full year Government revenues grew 12% to $6 billion. Sales for the Enterprise business decreased by 3% to $733 million in Q4. Excluding the impact of the Psion acquisition, Q4 revenues declined 12%. For the full year 2012, the Enterprise business posted revenues of $2.7 billion, declining 5% year-over-year. This decline was driven by the macroeconomic environment and constrained IT spend; fewer large deals in areas that were strong last year, such as transportation and logistics; and unfavorable FX.","Operating expenses were $761 million or 31.2% of revenue, which represents a 30-basis-point improvement from the year-ago quarter. Our operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $476 million or 19.5% of sales compared to $444 million or 19.3% in Q4 2011. I am pleased with our quarterly year-over-year improvement, as well as our full year performance, as we grew 2012 operating earnings by 9%. This improvement was achieved despite approximately $50 million in incremental U.S. annual pension expense in 2012. Our teams continue to drive profitable growth by making the critical investments required to grow the business while exercising disciplined cost management. Total other income and expense was a net expense of $16 million in the quarter compared to a net expense of $9 million in Q4 of 2011.","Our effective tax rate was approximately 32% for the quarter. This was lower than expected due primarily to true-ups of prior year taxes based on the recent filing of the U.S. income tax return, resulting in approximately $0.04 of additional EPS in Q4. The cash tax rate was again below 20% for the year as we continue to utilize available tax credits on our balance sheet. We expect the remaining tax credits to contribute to an average cash tax rate of approximately 20% for the next several years.","I'm extremely pleased with our execution on delivering cash flow for the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $564 million this quarter. This was driven by strong net income and improved working capital management across the board. This includes an improvement in days sales outstanding and inventory turns from Q3. For the full year, we generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, which includes $340 million of contributions to the U.S. pension plan.","We ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in cash and investments and $1.9 billion in debt. During Q4, we repurchased $326 million of stock, which brought us to $2.4 billion or nearly 50 million shares for the year. In the first 6 quarters of the plan, we repurchased $3.5 billion or 76 million shares at an average price of $46.57. This means we've reduced our net share count by 20% over this period. In addition, we paid $73 million in dividends during the quarter and a total of $270 million for the full year.","Before turning to our outlook, I want to spend a moment to summarize some important changes in terms of pension expense and cash contribution to the U.S. pension plan. Interest rates continue to decline from last year's historic lows, and based on the 4.35% discount rate at the end of 2012, our total underfunded U.S. pension balance increased from $2.2 billion to $2.8 billion. With that said, we expect 2013 U.S. pension expense to return to levels more consistent with 2011 or approximately $130 million.","The year-over-year decrease is driven by changes to our loss amortization period, which was increased from 9 years, the previous estimate of remaining service period for active employees, to 28 years, the average remaining total participant life expectancy. The increase in the amortization period is in accordance with relevant accounting rules and was driven by the change in mix of active and non-active employees remaining in the plan, and substantially, all of our plan participants are no longer actively employed by the company due to significant employee exits as a result of the Mobility spin and recent divestitures. We are planning approximately $300 million in cash contributions to the U.S. pension plan in 2013, and we expect similar levels of contributions in future years.","Now turning to our Q1 and full year outlook. For Q1, we expect sales growth of 4% to 5% over the first quarter of 2012. Our outlook is for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.67 from continuing operations based on the Q4 ending share count. This compares to non-GAAP EPS in Q1 2012 of $0.59 per share. This outlook excludes stock-based compensation and intangible amortization expenses of approximately $0.13 per share and other items historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings releases.","Moving to full year 2013. Our outlook is for sales growth of 5% to 5.5%, which includes an anticipated $65 million year-over-year iDEN decline to approximately $200 million. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 18%. Operating cash flow should improve largely in line with net income growth.","In addition, I would like to provide some color on a few other items. We expect other income and expense to be a net expense of approximately $25 million per quarter, while our full year effective tax rate should be approximately 34%. We also plan quarterly share repurchases to approximate the levels that we have executed over the past 2 quarters.","I'll now turn it over to Greg for business highlights from the quarter.","Gregory Q. Brown","Thanks, Ed. In Government, our sales for the quarter were $1.7 billion, up 10% over Q4 2011. We continued to see broad-based growth across the portfolio and in all regions. Profitability for the business also increased, with operating earnings of 21.8% of sales compared to 19.8% in Q4 of last year.","For the full year, we saw strong growth across all of our major product lines in Government, including double-digit growth in ASTRO and TETRA, along with near double-digit growth in our professional and commercial radios. In addition, growth extended beyond our radio solutions with double-digit growth in our mission-critical command and control portfolio.","Full year growth of 12% was balanced across both infrastructure and devices. Mission-critical system infrastructure sales increased significantly in ASTRO and TETRA, which, we believe, is an indicator of future subscriber demand. Since 2009, our focused R&D investments have led to the introduction of over 100 new products across both subscribers and infrastructure. And while mandates to improve spectrum efficiency encouraged some of our U.S. customers to upgrade, our new product introductions and expanded portfolio were a far more significant driver for us, demonstrated by our international growth. We had a strong finish to a very good year in North America, with full year sales growth of 14%. We also had double-digit growth in Latin America this year and solid growth in EMEA and Asia as well.","In ASTRO, our market-leading P25 technology, we now have over 30 customers contracted for Phase 2 TDMA systems. This technology is twice as efficient as required by the current FCC narrowband mandate in the United States and enables double the channels and throughput. And during the quarter, several new customers signed up for this industry-leading solution, including Montgomery County, Pennsylvania for $39 million; Tacoma, Washington for $28 million; Clayton County, Georgia for $17 million; and Onslow County, North Carolina for $13 million.","Customers like these who are investing in our next-generation systems have the assurance that new radios with enhanced features remain interoperable and backward-compatible with legacy P25 Phase 1 radios using our dynamic dual-mode feature. Our solutions allow customers to incrementally invest like Camden, New Jersey, a municipality that recently added a $12 million expansion to their countywide trunk system to add geographic coverage and new users from surrounding agencies.","Our ASTRO technology extends beyond North America as we now have deployments in over 60 countries as well. Several new awards this quarter highlight this trend, including in Latin America: Colombia, Ministry of Defense for $12 million; Panama, Ministry of Public Safety for $6.5 million; and a large system for the Brazilian Army. And in Australia, we won numerous awards across all the mainland states that exceed $25 million in total.","We had a record year in TETRA. We also celebrated a shipment milestone for TETRA with 2 million units shipped over the life of the portfolio, a portfolio which we've expanded significantly. Just 3 years ago, we only had 1 TETRA radio model. We now have a portfolio of over 8 radios, with the introduction this quarter of 2 new mobiles and the most advanced TETRA portable radio in the world.","We're seeing the results of this TETRA investment with wins throughout Europe, including Germany, and also, in Asia. For example, the State of Brandenburg, Germany recently selected Motorola for a 4-year agreement to supply over 20,000 TETRA radios, along with software and services for police, fire and EMS. Other TETRA wins this quarter included a multimillion dollar project with a large nuclear power company in Russia, upgrades for the Shanghai Metro system for $7 million and awards for the Shanxi Police and Guangdong Police in China.","Moving on to our Enterprise segment. Sales in Enterprise were $733 million, a decrease of 3% from Q4 of 2011, including the anticipated decline in iDEN and the addition of $72 million in Psion revenues. Operating earnings declined to 14.1% of sales from 18.2% last year. For the full year, the 5% decline in the Enterprise segment was impacted by the anticipated decline in iDEN of nearly $100 million, partially offset by the Q4 revenues from Psion. Our results were impacted by external factors such as a challenging macro environment leading to suppressed IT spend and unfavorable FX. In addition, there was some uncertainty around operating system roadmaps for enterprise mobile computing that we believe caused some customers to pause.","Looking across the portfolio on a full year basis. Advanced data capture grew single digits, offset by a single-digit decline in enterprise mobile computing and a double-digit decline in WLAN. Despite the macro uncertainty, our engagement with customers remain strong, with examples of some customers who continue to invest in our mobile technologies which yield high return on investment. The largest bakery in the world, Grupo Bimbo, recently awarded us a global supply agreement for mobile computing solutions that includes the M65 [ph] for use in direct route delivery and bakery operations, beginning with a deployment in Mexico. And Target recently awarded us a contract to deploy next-generation mobile computers in their stores.","This quarter, The Home Depot continued to invest in their first phone platform. These are associate productivity tools based on our mobile computing devices. Home Depot's investment will help to further reduce the time an associate spends on store tasks. Their goal has been to reduce task time from 60% to 40% and in return, enable store associates to spend more time with customers. The Motorola solution provides inventory information and the communications an associate needs to serve a customer.","Ferguson, the largest wholesale distributor of residential and commercial plumbing supplies in the U.S., recently chose Psion's EP10 devices to fully optimize its logistic and delivery fleet. And Volkswagen recently chose Psion mobile computers for use in manufacturing at warehouse operations at their Puebla, Mexico plant. Italiane Poste (sic) [Poste Italiane] invested in our DC92 [ph] scanners, along with an additional 10,000 MC65 mobile computers to be deployed through their post offices in Italy. Australia Post recently ordered 9 million worth of mobile computing solutions, and Norwegian Post ordered 2 million of additional MC65 mobile computers as well.","For the second year in a row, we were recognized as the Best Partner Supplier to Tesco. In addition, we received their Innovation Partner of the Year for our work on the SB1 and the personal shopping solution based on our MC17. This partnership with Tesco is an example of the deep domain expertise and investment that Enterprise customers expect from Motorola.","We recently introduced the MC45, a value-tier WAN-enabled device that extends our knowledge worker portfolio, for reaching the field mobility segments in emerging markets. We also announced the P6000 (sic) [MP6000] multiplane scanner, which fits inside the checkout counters used by retailers. Our investment in camera-based technology have enabled us to enter this new segment with a superior product to serve many existing retail customers and address a $250 million market opportunity that is new to us.","The National Retail Federation's annual big show was just last week. Show attendance and our booth traffic was up significantly from last year as attendees were interested in new technology for retailers to improve their customers' experience. One theme from the show was clear, that a more informed consumer is driving retailers to invest. Our annual consumer shopping study revealed that over 60% of retail managers believe that shoppers are better connected to information than their in-store employees. Retailers who embrace technology and enable their store associates to directly engage shoppers are creating differentiation through customer service and avoiding costly lost sales.","Now switching gears and turning to a regional overview of the company. North America grew 9% for the quarter and year driven by strength across the Government portfolio, especially within ASTRO and professional and commercial radio. In Enterprise, depressed IT spend contributed to fewer large deals in enterprise mobile computing, while our data capture business turned in solid results. EMEA grew 4% for the quarter, including Psion, while full year growth came in at 2%. Government returned to growth for the year despite the challenging backdrop of austerity. Contracts like Norway and Germany and the expanded TETRA product portfolio contributed to a good year. Enterprise declined but held up well considering the unfavorable euro impact in 2012 and a mid-20% growth compare in the previous year for 2011.","Asia grew 5% for the quarter and for the full year. Although these results were below our expectations, we remain confident in our long-term prospects for this region. Latin America grew 16%, excluding iDEN. Government grew solid double digits as we saw good performance in several of our larger countries. In services, we had a great year as well, with 9% growth driven by solid results in our largest region of North America and double-digit growth internationally.","In our Government business, we recently signed managed service contracts with Austin, Texas for a $32 million multiphase upgrade that will ensure their P25 system stays current with evolving technology; and with Prince William County, Virginia for a $25 million computer-aided dispatch solution. Enterprise customers are also looking for end-to-end solutions, and we signed several agreements with nationwide retailers that attach managed services and comprehensive device management with our mobile computers.","In October, many of our customers and employees on the East Coast were impacted by Hurricane Sandy's devastation. Motorola was on the ground to help, and we continue to assist with rebuilding efforts. Storms like Sandy illustrate the unique requirements public safety has for their mission-critical networks built around highly redundant architectures that include features like talk around, where our devices communicate directly with each other. It's estimated that almost 25% of the commercial cellular towers in the area were off-line due to the hurricane. However our LAN mobile radio systems were fully operational and available to assist first responders with their rescue and recovery efforts.","Q4 results were a great finish to another outstanding year: solid revenue growth, expanded operating margins, over 26% earnings per share growth and continued return of capital to shareholders. We continue to execute on our strategy with a sharpened focus on Government and Enterprise and a promise to help people be their best in the moments that matter. I'd like to thank our 22,000 employees for another year of focus and performance, and I look forward to 2013. The demand drivers for our business remain solid, and we continue to invest and innovate for profitable growth.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein.","Pierre Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I was wondering how you see the evolution of your operating expenses in 2013. If I look at the -- just the way you've guided the year and the plan and operating margins, if I assume things are not going to change much on a -- at your gross margin level, I thought that end up with OpEx growing at a faster rate than in 2012. So is that just me making the wrong assumptions? Or do you see like expenses increasing a bit faster this year compared to last year?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","I think on the operating expenses side, you shouldn't see significant changes year-over-year. The one benefit that I had mentioned was the pension expense will be a bit better. Other than that, we will dial up and dial down as appropriately within R&D, marketing and selling to ensure that we're addressing the opportunities. But the year-over-year levels should be relatively consistent, up slightly, driven by annual merits and the like, Pierre.","Pierre Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And maybe, if I can just ask one quick follow-up. You have a lot of new products coming in, in your Enterprise division. And could you give us an update on these products? When do you expect them to hit the markets? And if you have already some perspective on whether your Enterprise clients are going to adopt to these new products really quickly or if we are in a situation where there is a risk of a very slow ramp-up because of the economic environments?","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes, Pierre, I think that we have a couple of the new products already available now on the enterprise mobile computing side. To be more specific on some of the new, new, the MC40, we expect to be available and shipping in Q2, which is great, a front-store-facing operations device that will expand our portfolio. Our SB1 smart badge should also be generally available in Q2. And then, the multiplane scanner should be available by midyear as well. So in addition to some of the new MC series mobile computing devices that are already shipping, we have these new products that will be available in a couple of quarters, and we feel pretty good about the portfolio.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jim Suva with Citigroup.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I have 2 questions. First of all, can you talk a little bit -- you mentioned a little about a pause in mobility. Is that Enterprise related to like the uncertain IT budget spending environments? Or what kind of caused that pause? And if so, is that kind of -- is it going to be resolved here in the next couple months? And then, the second question I had is on the your net cash position, can you just kind of remind us of your goals, your leverage plans and any debt you may take out, kind of time line we should think about and using it for stock buyback, accretive acquisitions?","Gregory Q. Brown","So Jim, on the Enterprise side, I think the pause was due to a few things: Number one, fewer larger deals, which represented basically a number of smaller deals that made it difficult to compare on the previous year comp. But also, the pause was around, to your point, IT spending acknowledging the macro environment. I think we believe that will improve as IT spend and -- IT hardware spend is anticipated to increase. There was also, I think -- and I mentioned it last call anecdotally, but I think that around operating system roadmaps, specifically Microsoft Windows 8, which has been remediated, and we announced at NRF plans the incorporate Windows Embedded 8 into some of our devices in '13, so I think that takes care of itself as well. So generally speaking, I think that the environment for Enterprise should improve. Remember also in Enterprise, we also have a couple of products available on Android, our ET1 tablet and new device that I just referenced with Pierre, the MC40. So we feel pretty well equipped because we have devices on Microsoft 6.5.3 and devices on Android, with extra enterprise security great features that have been developed on top of Android. And we also have HTML5, which is a web browser level. So we can accommodate applications through a variety of different enterprise environments. Between that, new products and an improving external environment, we think it should get better. In terms of debt -- or net cash and debt, Ed and I have talked about we came out of the quarter with net cash of $1.9 billion, gross cash of $3.6 billion. And it is our intention at some point in 2014 to go into a net debt position. And the only other color I'd give you, Jim, on cash is referencing you to Ed's comments in the script, which talked about share repurchases of approximately in line or comparable to the previous 2 quarters, Q3 and Q4. So that should dimensionalize where we are in net cash, where we're headed with net debt and our planned expenditures. Very much in line with what we outlined at the financial analyst meeting last year. We're well on our way there.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kulbinder Garcha with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My first question for Greg is just in terms of the revenue growth of 5% between Government and Enterprise, can you give us an idea as to how each of them grow? Maybe I missed it, but in 2012 for the full year, what effect did you see narrowbanding had? And then, the second question is kind of a follow-up to the last one, I guess [indiscernible] -- maybe this is more for Greg. Is that you guys have exceeded on your margin numbers. Your free cash flow conversion is improving. Why is that debt -- adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2x the appropriate number? Why wouldn't that number be higher? And what would make you consider taking that [indiscernible] and distributing even more cash to shareholders? Is it under consideration? Or do you have good reasons to believe you can keep it at this level?","Gregory Q. Brown","So on the revenue first, Kulbinder, for the full year in '13, as kind of a backdrop to the overall revenue growth of 5% to 5.5%, we're planning for Government to be up low- to mid-single digits, Enterprise to be up mid- to high-single digits and of course, that includes Psion and includes the contraction of $65 million of iDEN for narrowbanding.","Mark F. Moon","Yes, Kulbinder, in relationship to narrowbanding, I think we have spoken in the past it was approximately 3% of the growth in the quarter and approximately 3% for the full year for the Government growth, when you think about that. I think as you look going forward, and we've talked before, remember though, narrowbanding was just a U.S. phenomena, and it really only impacted about 30% of the U.S. installed base. So as we look going forward, we're still excited about our product portfolio with the new features, their efficiency, the fact of users moving from analog to digital, an aging installed base. And you saw throughout all the regions, as Greg mentioned earlier, we had growth in the Government segments. So it was not really just a narrowband U.S. impact.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","And on the EBITDA and debt levels, Kulbinder, we have talked about an adjusted-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA something with a 2 handle on it. We're still comfortable with that. With that said, I would mention that the pension obligation going up to the level that it did, something in the mid-2s, is probably more appropriate at this point, and with that, we believe we can maintain that solid investment-grade rating. But you're right, as we grow EBITDA levels, we will be increasing the debt levels, as we had outlined -- as I said last year at the financial analyst meeting, such that we get to the point of a net debt position by 2014.","Operator","And we'll go next to Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First, I have a clarification. I wonder if you could just lay out again what the pension expense and the cash contribution was in 2012 and what you expect those 2 things to be in 2013. And then, on the share buyback, if I build in the $300 million or so a quarter in buyback, I don't get anywhere near a net debt position in 2014, given the free cash flow generation. So should we expect that to accelerate at some point after the next couple of quarters because of the timing of getting cash back from overseas? Or maybe I'm just building in too much free cash flow, but any commentary around that would be helpful.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","I think I can fill in the blanks a little bit with some assumptions that you need to add in there because there's a couple different elements within the capital allocation plan. But first, on the pension side, pension expense, I think, was approximately $185 million this year, and we should go to approximately $130 million for next year. So that's the improvement that I had mentioned. Cash contributions were approximately $340 million this year, and that will go something in the range of approximately $300 million next year, so a little bit of improvement in both. And on the capital allocation plan, I think those levels do get us on the right trajectory. The one thing that we are factoring, as we had mentioned, as part of our capital allocation plan that 50, 30, 20 allocation of share repurchase and acquisitions does include an element of acquisitions as well, so we would plan for some level of acquisitions. Of course, you'd need to meet all the right hurdles in that capital allocation plan such that we get to that net debt position by 2014.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then, on the full year Enterprise growth, Greg, that you mentioned, should we expect that to be back-end loaded given the comps get a lot easier? Or do you see something in the visibility of that business where we might expect that to be positive earlier in the year?","Gregory Q. Brown","I think it will obviously improve from the previous year, but I would think the trajectory, Tavis, will be gradual as we go through the year.","Operator","And we'll go next to the side of Ehud Gelblum with Morgan Stanley.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Greg, you talked a lot about the new products, both in the Enterprise and the Government side, and it seems like ASTRO and TETRA are doing very well. Can you give a sense revenue-wise how each -- I don't know how you segment out prior products versus new products. Can you give us some sort of sense as to, revenue-wise, how large the new products are within your portfolio and how that's grown over the last couple of years?","Gregory Q. Brown","So we do track NPI revenues as a percentage of the overall revenue contribution. Obviously, as you might imagine, Ehud, with the increased NPIs, new product introductions, that have materialized. The percentage as a basis of total revenue has increased. We don't break out with any level of granularity or detail beyond that. But it is -- it's consistently gotten better, as you've mentioned, clearly on the ASTRO and TETRA side, and we expect it to improve on the Enterprise as well, given the number of new products both toward the end of this past year and the launches that we have in Q1 and Q2.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And following up just on that before I get to something else. Is the margin different at all on new products? Because they're new, you can maybe charge more for them? Or should we look at them as just a continuation of the previous portfolio?","Gregory Q. Brown","I would say a continuation and generally comparable.","Mark F. Moon","I think, just to add to that piece, one of the advantages of continuing to refresh our product portfolio is the ability to continue to provide different options so that you're able to maintain the ASPs throughout the portfolio as we go forward.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That's actually a helpful way to look at it. Then, Ed, can you quickly go over the pension change that you mentioned, that change in the liability -- amortization period? Just so we can understand that a little bit better. And then, Greg, finally, do you have any thoughts on 2 of your competitors in the Enterprise side, Honeywell and Intermec merging -- Honeywell buying Intermec? And does that give you an opportunity in the near term because of potential confusion in the market? Does that make the industry more consolidated and help pricing? Or do you think that could be more challenging as you go forward? Anything you can say about kind of industry consolidation?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","So I'll cover the pension piece first. So the change that we had mentioned really is in accordance with FASB 87. As we've had the spinoff of the Mobility business and the recent divestitures that we've talked about, predominantly all of our employees are no longer active employees of the firm. As a result of that, FASB 87 prescribes that you would use the total population life expectancy to amortize that pension expense, as opposed to what we were using before, which was the active employees' service life remaining with the company. That's the result and change from 9 to 28 years. And if you think about it, a perfectly logical answer, which I think is much more aligned with the economic realities of the pension plan, given that very few of our active employees make up the total participant pool of the pension expense that we're funding and recognizing through expense over a period of time. So that's the change. It was all part of a comprehensive review as well of the plan. As we've looked at our asset returns as well and given the returns on the portfolio, you'll see that asset return come down from what we've assumed over 8% to something with a 7% handle in it going forward. We also adopted a year early the mortality tables, which is a bit more conservative. Given that people are living longer, that expense will expand. So all of that is contemplated and reflected in that net improvement, if you will, that we talked about a little bit earlier in the call.","Gregory Q. Brown","And Ehud, on Honeywell and Intermec, I'd make a few points. First of all, I like it because it validates the attractiveness of the industry. I'm not surprised at all that -- Intermec's been rumored for actually quite a while to be acquired, so I wasn't at all surprised. Obviously, very familiar with both Intermec and Honeywell, but that said, pretty confident in the value proposition we offer. The other thing I'd say is suffice to say we've looked at a variety of acquisition alternatives throughout last year. We prioritized Psion for a reason, and we're very pleased that we added them to the portfolio. We had other options available to us, but Psion was the one we felt the most bullish about because of what they do, their complementary product portfolio and some of the extensions into some other European and other geographies that we think are complementary. Remember, Honeywell continues on this buying spree. They bought HHP, Metrologic, LXE. Now Intermec Vocollect. There'll be several months until the deal is approved, assuming it gets approved. No reason to think it wouldn't, but they'll have their work to do on integrating the variety of mobile computing assets that really for us in Psion is much more clean. And finally, I think in this space, it is less about price and more about total cost of ownership. And the solutions orientation that you bring to bear and the customized and integrated applications that we implement for customers. So net-net, all those ingredients into the blender, we feel good about our position.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jeff Kvaal with Barclays.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A couple of questions, I think. Number one, one for you, Greg, would you mind helping us understand what your assumptions are for LTE growth in both North America and the rest of world? And is that a part of your 2013 planning assumptions? And then secondly, I think, Ed, for you, in the past, you talked about backlog. Would you mind giving us an update on that, if you can, please?","Gregory Q. Brown","Jeff, in LTE incorporated into the full year guidance of 5% to 5.5%, we still believe that LTE will not be more than $100 million for the full year largely in the second half of '13, and I think it'll be primarily driven by the Middle East and less North America, from a timing perspective. That said, we continue to work very closely with FirstNet. There's, as you know, some early BTOP awards and spectrum waivers with customers like Mississippi and BayWEB. And Mark and I work closely with FirstNet and those end-user customers in hopes that they will begin to move forward in 2012. But it's not more than $100 million and more international than North America-driven for 2013. But I'd also say though, we continue to invest, from an R&D standpoint, in subscribers, in devices and in infrastructure. We've got 3 products that are announced and launched now, a USB dongle, a vehicular modem, a LEX 700, and that's part of the incorporated R&D spend that we plan.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Well, backlog, I'll cover high level, and Mark, add any color commentary as appropriate here. But backlog, an important thing to note here is backlog is up year-over-year from where we ended Q4 of last year, so up year-over-year, really driven primarily by Government. Enterprise, down a bit, as you would expect, given the sales levels that we're seeing through today, sequentially down a bit but really in line with what we would have expected. So with that, I'll let Mark talk a little bit more color by business.","Mark F. Moon","Yes, just I think, as you think about backlog in particular, from a Government segment, which is a much longer-cycle segment, the fact that we're up significantly by about $500 million year-on-year, I think, is important. Also, I would add that North America coming off of a very, very strong year that we've been talking about each quarter in Government was also flat in backlog, so we did not eat into the backlog, another positive sign of demand. And as we've mentioned, even though Enterprise did not have the year that we had hoped, backlog remains flat as we look sequentially with what happens. And as Greg had mentioned earlier in his comment, we're having a lot of good conversations coming out of NRF, very good excitement, not only about the portfolio, but about the need to continue to do things to enhance employee productivity and enhance the customer experience as they go forward. So backlog, I think, from the perspective of how we look at it, we're in good shape going into the year.","Jeffrey T. Kvaal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'd like to follow up on that. And then ask -- it seems as though the expectation that you have for Enterprise growth in 2013 is quite a turnaround from 2012. What are the factors that give you the confidence in there? It doesn't sound like backlog per se supports some of those. Enterprise, of course, is not as big of a backlog business.","Mark F. Moon","Exactly. That's why I kind of compared that sequentially, but you're right. As you look at the Enterprise segment, it is a more quick-turn type of business. When we talked about the drivers that kind of impacted 2012, we talked about the year-on-year comparables. Obviously, as we go into this year, our year-on-year comparable is much different given the performance we had in 2012. There's also been some positive indicators with the projections or forecast for IT spend. IT hardware spend, retail spending are all up year-on-year, which is a good sign for us. We were also impacted by the FX environment, particularly in Europe last year. That seems to be stabilizing. And as we mentioned earlier, a number of new products and some clarity around the iOS roadmap for the future, I think, all brings us with a sense that we can return to mid- to high-single digit growth for the year.","Gregory Q. Brown","And I think that -- don't forget, of course, the incremental revenue from Psion. We have new products shipping, the FX environment, as Mark mentioned, much more stable, and we have clarity on the Windows Embedded 8 roadmap. So there's a few tangible beyond the environmental things that are specific that are improving, so that's incorporated into our thinking.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Barta with Northcoast Research.","John Barta - Northcoast Research","Assuming pricing is constant on the Enterprise side, how should we look at the introduction of Psion's mix of business? Are Psion's products more rugged, higher-priced products or a little less than Motorola's norm?","Mark F. Moon","So I think when you think about Psion's products, they clearly are targeted at a different space than where we primarily compete, things like manufacturing, ports, cold storage; clearly, a rugged product. They have done fairly well in their margins and their average selling prices in the past. We obviously think bringing them into the portfolio, we can begin to leverage the size of Motorola. But what makes us most excited is it really does expand our footprint and the ability to kind of leverage Motorola products into those verticals, Psion products back into the spaces that we discussed, a couple of customers, we mentioned earlier, back into our piece. So together, we think the 2 portfolios are very complementary.","Gregory Q. Brown","In addition to that, John, I think that the opportunity with Psion is on the gross margin side. Their pricing is good. We always thought that there's opportunity for gross margin improvement as they're under the umbrella of Motorola Solutions. As we look at complementary and similar suppliers and component purchases with our larger scale, we believe that we'll be able to improve the gross margin profile from Psion. Less about pricing, more about gross margin improvement.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","I think we're on the right track there, too. We talked about roughly breakeven in the fourth quarter of '12 and in 2013, get to profitability, not quite the levels that were -- that we see across the rest of the business, but we will get to profitability in 2013. That's our current plan.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt Hoffman with Cowen and Company.","Matthew Hoffman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Another Enterprise question. You addressed the growth equation there a couple of times, but was wondering whether you could add some color on the OS component. You have products, multiple OSs in the pipeline. But how much did buyer uncertainty around OS roadmaps factor into the 2012 equation? And then call out the features that they're looking for and that might help the '13 equation there.","Mark F. Moon","So I think it was clearly a component of the pause. I wouldn't blame it all on that or hide behind it. The category of enterprise mobile computing contracted generally in line with what we contracted. So I think we generally held share. I think there's much better clarity. Remember, the enterprise mobile computing or rugged mobile computing is virtually 100% Microsoft as an installed base. Typically, Windows CE, Windows embedded handheld. So these customers that have Microsoft as a reference point want the clarity and migration to Windows Embedded 8. I think that clarity is now there. We worked closely with Microsoft. We'll be shipping some new product in Q2 that gives those customers critical clarity and comfort around that roadmap. In terms of features, Matt, we add enterprise software features or enterprise-grade features on top of Windows Embedded 8 handheld, either that Microsoft puts in or that we put in, things around enterprise-grade security, power management, optimizing a wireless experience over voice and data and sensors like data capture. It's the unique features in this segment that allow purpose-built devices that are integrated with applications to flourish. And a lot of work's been down there, so we feel pretty well positioned that, that clarity and then ultimately shipping product will give customers what they need by midyear.","Matthew Hoffman - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Thanks for the color there. That definitely helps out. So just one follow-up on the Enterprise side. You called out wireless LAN. It was down, I think, double digits. You called it out. Do you think that was more the vertical overall? Or is there, again, a product delay or product issue there?","Mark F. Moon","I think the disappointment in what the wireless LAN business is mainly us, not environmental. The WLAN segment, in general, continues to grow. We lost share. We remain strong in our core verticals at retail and transportation and logistics, and we're not pleased with losing share. That said, we do have some strong opportunities in the beginning of the year. The funnel is more robust. We see more customers want to engage less on buying WLAN product per se and more into a managed-services-type value proposition that we'll incorporate and adopt. We feel better that the business can perform better in 2013, and we have higher expectations. But at the end of the day, we've got to deliver. The loss of share is more us than environmental. We got to do better.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","I was hoping you might be able to walk us through the anticipated contribution of the Psion business, the total revenue in 2013 and if you could quantify what type of devices -- or operating system those devices are using. And then I have a quick follow-up.","Gregory Q. Brown","Just to dimensionalize it, again, we had $72 million of revenue in Q4. We're planning on approximately $250 million for the full year for Psion in 2013. As Mark referenced, they're purpose-built devices that are extensions of what we do now, vehicle-mount terminals in a forklift, very rugged cold storage applications, cold storage that'll tolerate subzero temperatures. And their portfolio is Microsoft-oriented as well, so it's very similar, if not identical, to the enterprise mobile computing segment.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","And as you think about the profitability of the business that we said we'll get it to profitable. It will be below the levels that we see for the rest of the business, probably something below 10%, above 5%, in that range. If you think about operating expenses in that business, when I gave the commentary earlier, you should make sure that you factor in our year-over-year growth and our operating expenses effectively, the incremental Psion-related spend to support that business, partially offset by the improvement in the pension cost that I had talked about. And with all of that, you should then plan relatively comparable with the impact of annual merits. So spending will be up slight -- up a bit year-over-year in the aggregate. But as a percentage of sales, it will be -- it will improve.","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","And then, could you walk us through where U.S. cash versus offshore cash is and your CapEx targets for 2013?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Sure. So U.S. cash, in excess of 40%, I think 42% or 43%. I think we're $1.5 billion U.S. cash of the total $3.6 billion. Your question on CapEx, was that for 2012 or...","Benjamin James Bollin - Cleveland Research Company","2013.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","So as we think of the model, we're kind of simplifying a bit to kind of a 50% -- 50% allocated to a combination of share repurchase or acquisitions, 30% consistent for dividends and approximately 20% for CapEx. We did -- CapEx for the year, we did about $185 million to $190 million for 2012. You should expect us to see higher levels of CapEx next year, and the biggest growth segment there would be in the area where we invest in revenue-type opportunities, build on operated opportunities you've heard us talk about in the past. So more success-based capital will be our goal, and that is really the main driver for the -- what you're going to see year-over-year in the increase in capital expenditures as we get into 2013.","Operator","And I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks.","Shep Dunlap","All right, thanks.

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll now share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook.","First, Q1 was an outstanding quarter and a strong foundation for what I expect to be an excellent 2018. Total revenue grew 15%, with organic revenue up 10%, and we grew organically in every region led by North America organic growth of 8%.","Second, we're raising full-year guidance for both revenue and EPS on continued growth throughout the year. We now expect full-year 2018 revenue growth of approximately 14%, which includes organic constant currency growth of about 4%, up versus our prior guidance of about 2.5%, and we now expect higher EPS of $6.70 to $6.85.","And finally, our LMR business continues to perform exceptionally well. We grew revenue in every region. We grew EPS by 55% and we ended the quarter with record backlog. This strong performance, coupled with the acquisition of Avigilon, which increases our total addressable market by $11 billion-plus, provides strong momentum for the remainder of 2018 and beyond.","I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook, before returning for some closing thoughts.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Greg. Q1 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 15% versus last year, including $49 million of revenue from acquisitions and $15 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606.","Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 10%. Organic revenue in constant currency was up 7%, including $39 million of favorable FX.","During the quarter, the company adopted ASC 606. The primary change for MSI was the reclassification of third-party sales commission, which had historically been presented as a reduction of revenue. Starting in Q1, these commissions are now reported as operating expenses.","For the full year, we expect incremental revenue from the adoption of ASC 606 of approximately $75 million and approximately $0.01 of incremental EPS, which occurred in Q1.","GAAP operating earnings were $171 million, down $2 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $260 million, up $48 million or 23% from the year-ago quarter. And operating margins were 17.7% of sales, up 120 basis points from last year.","GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, up 53% from $0.45 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.10, up 55% from $0.71 last year. Ending backlog was $9.6 billion, up $1.1 billion versus last year. Products segment backlog was up $166 million or 11% and Services segment backlog was up $973 million or 14%.","Q1 Products sales were $801 million, up 14% from last year and growth in every region. North America Product revenue was up 14% in the quarter. Q1 Products segment operating income was $127 million or 15.9% of sales, up 250 basis points from last year, driven primarily by higher sales.","Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.7 billion, up $166 million or 11% versus last year, driven by North America and EMEA. This is the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year backlog growth. Sequentially, product backlog was down $178 million, driven primarily by the adoption of the accounting standard ASC 606.","Turning to Services. Q1 Services revenue was $667 million, up 15% from last year with growth in every region. Managed & Support Services grew 21% to $496 million, inclusive of $32 million from acquisitions.","Services operating income was $133 million or 19.9% of sales, down 50 basis points from last year, driven by higher OpEx related to acquisitions, FX and R&D investments in our software business. Gross margins were up 40 basis points on continued Managed & Support growth.","Services backlog ended at $7.9 billion, up $973 million or 14% versus last year, driven primarily by recurring Managed & Support Services. Sequentially, Services backlog is up $175 million or 2%.","Total OpEx in Q1 was $416 million, up $52 million from the year-ago quarter. Acquisitions added $15 million, FX added $12 million and the adoption of ASC 606 added $13 million. The balance is related to higher incentive payments and legal costs associated with the Hytera litigation, offset by cost reductions in the underlying business.","For the full year, we expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion versus $1.54 billion last year. The change is driven by approximately $200 million of OpEx related to acquisitions and approximately $75 million as a result of the adoption of ASC 606. We continue to expect operating expenses in the underlying business to be down approximately $20 million versus 2017.","Other income and expense was $27 million compared to $47 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $46 million compared to $51 million a year ago. And the Q1 effective tax rate was 19%.","Q1 operating cash flow was an outflow of $500 million versus $142 million of cash flow last year. The decline is attributable to $500 million pension contribution; $40 million of incentive payments, some of which was accelerated from Q2 in order to take advantage of the new tax legislation; $15 million of higher cash taxes; and it's also worth noting that we had a $52 million collection of a legal judgment in the prior year.","Free cash flow was a negative $541 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $27 million versus last year, as a result of lower IT spend related to the ERP implementation in 2017.","Normalized for pension, we continue to expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. The $1.4 billion now includes a $50 million payment related to a legacy Iridium settlement in India and $50 million of costs related to the acquisitions of Avigilon and Plant.","During the quarter, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured debt, which was contributed to the U.S. pension plan. We also secured $400 million of prepayable short-term debt and use $400 million from our credit revolver, as well as cash on hand to fund the acquisitions of Avigilon and Plant. Additionally, we repurchased $66 million of stock at an average price of $101.54 and paid dividends of $84 million.","Turning to our outlook. We are raising our revenue and EPS guidance for 2018. We expect Q2 sales to be up approximately 15%, with organic growth of approximately 4%. We expect EPS between $1.34 and $1.39. We now expect full-year 2018 revenue growth of approximately 14%, up from the prior guidance of 10% to 11% we provided at our Financial Analyst Meeting in February.","Organic growth for the full year is now expected to be approximately 5%, with organic constant currency growth of approximately 4%, up 150 basis points from our prior guidance. This updated guidance includes approximately $75 million of currency tailwinds, versus $130 million of currency tailwinds in our prior guidance.","EPS is expected to be $6.70 to $6.85, versus a prior outlook of $6.50 to $6.65. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%.","Also contemplated in guidance is now approximately $450 million of revenue from Avigilon and Plant with approximately $0.04 of EPS, net of higher interest expense and lower share repurchases. This is up $100 million and $0.04 of EPS from our February 27 guidance. Revenue from the adoption of ASC 606 is approximately $75 million with approximately $0.01 of EPS.","Looking at regional results. Americas revenue was up 15%, with organic growth of 8% in North America. The Americas growth was driven by strong demand for LMR products and services, serving public safety and commercial customers. Additionally, Q1 included a large customer shipment of approximately $50 million that was not expected to ship until later in 2018. This shipment was the largest single shipment we have had in any Q1 period.","And finally, Q1 backlog is up approximately $900 million year-over-year. EMEA revenue was up 18% on strength across both Products and Services, including $31 million from favorable FX. Backlog was also up in the region year-over-year.","And in Asia Pac, revenue was up 5% and growth in both Products and Services, including $6 million from favorable FX rates, while backlog was up on strong Services demand.","Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. First, we were selected by the State of Florida to build and manage a new statewide public safety network. This multi-year award, which is not yet reflected in our backlog, is another proof point of the longevity of land mobile radio.","Additionally, we won a $40 million Managed & Support Services contract with the State of Maryland, a $20 million Managed & Support Services contract with the State of Indiana, a $15 million award for a P25 system upgrade for Miami-Dade County in Florida, a $6 million Managed & Support Services contract with Petrobras in Latin America, and we announced the LEX L11 mission-critical LTE handheld device for global broadband networks, including FirstNet in the U.S.","Finally, we closed the acquisition of Avigilon, a leader in advanced video surveillance and analytics; and Plant, a leader in command center software and Next-Generation 911.","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Gino. Let me just close with two thoughts. First, Q1 was a great start with overall growth of 15% and organic growth of 10%, but I'm particularly pleased with our record backlog position, which further reinforces my confidence in raising our full-year guidance.","Second, I want to update you on our progress with the UK Home Office and our Airwave contract. Since I last referenced this a couple of months ago at our Financial Analyst Meeting, our discussions have been ongoing, active and productive. As a result, we now believe the Airwave contract will be extended by five or more years.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris.","Chris Kutsor - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up. Operator, would you please remind our callers how to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. The floor is now open for questions. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Matt Cabral with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thank you. Wanted to ask about organic growth. So, clearly, very strong start to the year. Can you just expand a little bit more on what's behind that strength and just the biggest sources of upside you saw versus 90 days ago?","And then the second part of the question. So, guidance for 5% for the full-year organic implies a little bit of a decel as we get through the balance of the year. Just wondering if there are any big drivers of that we should be thinking about, or if it's more just conservatism given where we are in the year at this point?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Matt, I think that on the first part I just think the overall demand is strong, which is reflected in our performance both for Q1 and embedded contextually in why we're raising the full year.","Now, it's worth noting that in Q1 we had the largest shipment we've ever had in the history of the company in a Q1. That was four times larger than the next largest shipment, and that's great.","But even absent that, overall demand remains quite solid. If you normalize for that, I think it's more informative to look kind of first half, second half and full year. And when you do that, first half organic growth constant currency is about 4%, second half is 4% and the full year is 4%.","I think our aged backlog position and record backlog position overall coming out of Q1 supplements that. So I wouldn't get too caught up. We don't look at it as a deceleration normalized for that large order. We look at it more as a constant linearity of demand throughout the year.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, for my follow up so, Greg, you closed out your prepared remarks talking about Airwave. Just, first, curious when do you think ultimately that will get to the resolution and that will be a finite thing that will come through?","And second, just on the Services backlog. Is there any increase from Airwave in there? Or is that Omnicom when we think about the additional five years that you talked about?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","First part, I think our expectation is we would look to finalize the agreement either this quarter or next quarter. And any extension of backlog that's contemplated in that extension of that agreement is not contemplated in the overall backlog or the Services segment backlog.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","You bet, Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon, guys. Appreciate the opportunity. As we look at the Services margins. Obviously, they've been increasing well and your Managed & Support Services had a great quarter this quarter. How should we think about the Services gross margins going forward? Is there an opportunity for those to rise at an early time? (19:44)","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. Keith, this is Gino. Our expectation for margin for 2018 is for margin to be up slightly, even if we exclude ASC 606. Clearly, with the $75 million of incremental revenue, that's expansion in the Product segment.","So the way to think about it is we expect Services gross margin to be up year-over-year. We expect Product margins to be comparable to what they were in 2017 and, overall, we do expect margin expansion in 2018.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes, I think Kelly Mark is doing some really good work on the Services side and on cost of goods and cost of delivery, as well as Jack. We reviewed that a few days ago. So, specifically on the Services gross margin, we do expect Services gross margin to be up this year over last year. Good work (20:44)","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. Appreciate the color. And just a follow-up for you. On FirstNet, we didn't hear anything about FirstNet I guess in the script. Any new thoughts on the progress of FirstNet and Motorola's involvement in that?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","We continue to work closely with AT&T. We had minimal revenue, virtually none, in Q1 from any contribution as it relates to FirstNet activity. We have talked about annual revenue guidance of $20 million to $40 million. Candidly, we're in May. We look at Q1. I know there's a lot of work to be done. I know a lot of good work is being done.","As Jack and I talk about this opportunity, I think we're going to be anchored more towards the low end of that guidance on revenue for 2018. But we continue to work closely with our customers and with our partner AT&T.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Vijay, we can't hear you.","Operator","Vijay, your line is open. Do you have us on mute? And my apologies, Vijay. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you guys hear me now? Yes. Yeah. Sorry, I was speaking to myself. Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. My question is on the acquisitions, Avigilon and also the Plant Holdings, seem very interesting. Greg, you might have a thought process in mind as to how to, like, waterfall this or ramp this through the course of the year and through next year.","I'd like to get your thought process from a management point of view, how do you plan to take these acquisitions into the MSI sales and marketing and product complex, and how should we look from both a marketing point of view and then also from your lens, how do you ramp it through the rest of the year and over the next few years? Thanks.","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. So, Vijay, I'll start with \u2013 it's Jack. I'll start with Avigilon. Early days been very impressed. Avigilon is a great company. I think the thing that we've spent our time is really around creation of revenue synergy. Obviously, as Greg has alluded to in the previous call, we kept this company as operating as they were before. And we've got a couple significant opportunities.","First and foremost, the United States Federal Government. Avigilon did not sell into the Fed's space, either the federal or the military space. We have opportunities really throughout that market. And obviously, we're using our direct sales force as a conduit or a channel to the Federal Government.","The second piece is in the U.S. and the public safety market. A lot of these, like, safe city, the Detroit Green Light like projects, we've got a list of probably 30 or 40 targeted cities that we're working with Avigilon and going after.","And the last thing is really heavy industry or enterprise Fortune kind of 300 kind of companies in both North America but throughout the world, and we're also looking to work closely with them on that.","So, from an Avigilon perspective, obviously great company. We think we've got opportunities. We've talked about our growth rates in 2018 for Avigilon as we modeled them are comparable to 2017.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","And I think that was the question. Was there a follow-on, Vijay? Were you also (24:20)","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. I think, yeah, the follow-on was around OpEx. I mean, honestly, the company has been doing a much better job, more credit to you and team, on OpEx as a percentage of revenues. That said, how should we think about this line item through the course of the year?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","So, Vijay, this is Gino. From the full-year, OpEx we expect to be $1.8 billion versus $1.54 billion in 2017. Approximately $200 million of that comes from the acquisitions from Plant and Avigilon, and $75 million from ASC 606, which is the accounting change.","The underlying business we continue to expect to be down approximately $20 million from 2017.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Perfect. Thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Vijay.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Kyle McNealy - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. This is Kyle on for George. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I want to ask a little bit more about Avigilon and how you think that now that it's layered in, what it does to the steady state kind of market growth rate of the combined company?","I know that it's a smaller piece of the business but I believe it was running at, at least a high-teens growth rate. So, just wanted to see if I can get your thoughts on how you see kind of the combined company growth through the end of the year 2018 and into 2019? Thanks.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. Kyle, a couple of things. As Jack just referenced, I think there's a number of ways we can extend, expand the Avigilon reach with: A, into the federal business; B, with global partners; and C, working with our direct sales team in the commercial markets, utilities, oil, gas and other critical verticals.","I think the way we're modeling this business and what's contemplated in our full-year growth is a double-digit revenue growth comparable to last year. Look, they were a public company. You've seen what they did. I think they were $353 million to $408 million, publicly traded on the Vancouver Exchange. That kind of growth rate is our current expectation by the way.","I mean, I think we want to be very prudent in modeling the business and don't get out ahead of our headlights. But there's no question the demand is pretty strong. Video is there. I think there's tremendous synergies and we'll update you accordingly between execution between now and the end of the year.","Kyle McNealy - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks. And I know that Avigilon, obviously, had more exposure to the commercial sector versus government. And how much has that changed your total company exposure in terms of commercial as a percent of sales? I know that you've historically been 70% to 75%. Has that changed much for Avigilon?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I think it's too early to tell. I mean, we're about 75% government and public safety and 25% commercial markets overall. Obviously, the opportunity is open-field running on federal and public safety. I think it's too early to predict a revenue composition per se, but clearly the opportunity is there.","Kyle McNealy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks. And one quick last one. How much in terms of the backlog did the Avigilon and Airbus acquisitions add to backlog? And then, do you have a quantification of the ASC 606 impact on backlog?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. Kyle, this is Gino. Avigilon doesn't come with a tremendous amount of backlog. It's in-quarter activity. So it was minimal. The Plant backlog was about $200 million and there was the last \u2013 oh, ASC 606 was a reduction in backlog of a little over $100 million.","Kyle McNealy - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot. And congrats on the quarter. Really fantastic results, so looking forward to hearing more. Thanks.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Kyle.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. We were pleased with backlog. It is very seasonally normal for this business, where overall backlog declines from a very robust Q4 into Q1. It was flat, which I think is another demand indicator, positively in terms of the trends and what we're seeing.","Kyle McNealy - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Sure, great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Mike Koban - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. This is Mike Koban on for Adam Tindle. Thanks for taking my question. Just a little bit more on Avigilon. So I'm just wondering if there's any more like investments or if there's any maybe obstacles you see in the future in kind of transferring your sales force's focus from what might be chiefly government into more commercial? And then I have one follow-up.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. And I'll let jump Jack jump in too. But I don't see any obstacles. And as Jack referenced, we're keeping Avigilon basically intact as a wholly-owned subsidiary. They do a different thing than we do. So I don't want to disrupt or unintendedly put any organizational or operational obstacles. This is a very well-run company.","We want to add capital to it. We want to add people to the sales force. We want to invest more. Avigilon is all about top-line growth. So I think it's a channel story, which is why it sits under Molloy, both direct, indirect and federal. And Jack's been given the green light by Gino and myself to provide the necessary capital investment to facilitate the growth that's in front of it.","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. And Greg, maybe just one follow-on. Mike, so from an enterprise and commercial market perspective, frankly, they do a superb job. They've got a channel that serves that market very well. So we think the incremental lift we can provide them, maybe at some heavy industry kind of companies I talked about. But interestingly enough, they don't do much business because they were a smaller company and they found that the business turned better, focused on enterprise securities space. They haven't focused on public safety.","Now, we have done large cities. Obviously, we manage the City of Chicago's video network, which is the largest public safety video network in the country. We've done Cleveland and the Detroit project as well. So we really \u2013 frankly, James Henderson and I have talked about this. We look at government and public safety as, frankly, open space. And we think that is a market, obviously, our sales team knows very well and we think there's only uplift as it applies to public safety and government in terms of Avigilon.","Mike Koban - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got you. Thanks. Thanks. Great color. And then, about FirstNet, just it looked like AT&T, I think they said recently that they were planning to hit about 20,000 sites in 2018. And I was just wondering if that was \u2013 how do you view that as maybe like an acceleration about what you expect? I know you touched on your kind of expectations for them. Just kind of wondering how the overall ramping process is moving along as far as in relation to how you expected it to go?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Well, remember, FirstNet through the lens of us, the partner, provides economic contribution in three ways; device sales, mainly push-to-talk device sales; mission-critical software applications; and thirdly, interoperability between LMR and public safety LTE.","Now, AT&T reported recently, they talked about some traction and uplift on their own results. I won't speak for them as it relates to FirstNet. But, for us, what matters is FirstNet users that are utilizing push-to-talk and we can only report on our end.","And again, as Jack referenced, the revenue contribution was virtually $0 in Q1. And the low end of guidance that we're anchoring now more toward on the $20 million to $40 million simply reflects our expectation based on the current view and Q1 around FirstNet's ability to provide economic impact to us, mainly through push-to-talk or related push-to-talk.","Mike Koban - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got you. Thanks. Great. That's all I got, guys. Thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you very much for taking my questions. First up, as we layer in the Avigilon business, how do we split out the Product from the Service component of that business? And what does it do to recurring? I think you exited last year with about 28% recurring. I imagine it's a lower proportion, probably doesn't impact it much, but would be good to know how that evolves.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Avigilon is primarily Product and has very little recurring. Overall, by the way, just from a Motorola Solutions standpoint, our recurring revenue was 34% coming out of Q1 as an overall enterprise, which of course we like.","Now Avigilon has very little recurring revenue. So, as more that revenue gets contemplated and factored into the full year, that number may compress a little bit. But absent Avigilon, we like the annual recurring revenue trends of the inherent business.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And the recurring revenue trend originates in the higher Service growth rate? Or is it the nature of the contracts that you're entering into?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I think it's primarily driven by a higher Managed & Support Services growth rate.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you very much.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Which by the way was 21% in Q1, with 13% organic contribution. It was strong.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Pleaes go ahead.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much. In your prepared comments, you mentioned about a very large shipment which happened in Q1 that was supposed to be happening later in the year.","My question to you is, does that open up the potential for other large shipments earlier in the year because the customer has received those shipments, they'll be testing, using, implementing, rolling them out, something great? And also is there a Service element attached to those which also again potentially kind of earlier than expected?","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Jim, it's Jack. And I believe the question was around the large shipment that Greg referenced in the prepared remarks. We always had that $60 million opportunity factored into the revenue in the year. We were going through some bureaucratic challenges within the customer and we were able to alleviate and work through.","And so, obviously, we moved the deal early into the year into Q1. But no, that $60 million, we shouldn't think of that as something that was based on timing. We just accelerated the full project and turned the revenue in the first quarter.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","And I think his other question was, do you see any Services content that could attach to that shipment.","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Minimal.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Okay.","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","It was a device sale. So it's minimal.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks so much. I appreciate all the details and clarification.","Operator","Thank you. Gentlemen, it appears we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Chris Kutsor, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks.","Chris Kutsor - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I think that will do it for this afternoon.

Welcome to the Motorola Solutions First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","The presentation material and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Motorola Solutions' Investor Relations website. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 3 hours after the conclusion of this call over the Internet. The website address is www.motorolasolutions.com\/investor.","[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Dunlap, you may begin your conference.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss first quarter results. With me this morning are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Ed Fitzpatrick, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mark Moon, Executive Vice President and President, Sales and Product Operations. Greg and Ed will review our results along with commentary, and Mark will join for the Q&A session.","Earlier this morning, we posted an earnings presentation and press release at motorolasolutions.com\/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. It's always important to review these materials.","A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation. Forward-looking statements are any statements that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations of Motorola Solutions, and we can give no assurance that any future results or events discussed in these statements will be achieved.","Any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements contained in this presentation.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Thanks, Shep. This morning, we reported first quarter sales of $2 billion, an increase of 1% over last year. Sales in Government increased 3% while Enterprise sales declined 4%. On a GAAP basis, net earnings from continuing operations were $0.68 per share compared to $0.50 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations were $0.66 per share compared to $0.59 per share in Q1 of last year, a 12% increase. For the remainder of this call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise noted.","Now as I think about our performance with respect to the quarter, I have 3 key takeaways I'd like to share with you on the business. First, execution on our business model remains solid with double-digit earnings per share growth, driven by disciplined cost management and our return of capital to shareholders.","Second, coming off a record year in 2012, we still had continued growth in Government with improved profitability in the segment as well, and North America was strong. In fact, growth in every region was good except Asia, where we did not perform up to our expectations.","And third, in Enterprise, revenue was softer than we anticipated and declined due to several factors. First, the WLAN business declined 30%, where we're simply not executing well. Second, our iDEN business declined over $30 million in the quarter. And third, our rugged mobile computing business continues to be impacted by some macro uncertainty and a pending operating system transition. In this environment, a number of customers delayed purchase decisions in the quarter.","Now that said, we believe improvement in the Enterprise business will be second-half driven for several reasons. First beginning in Q3, the run rate comps get more favorable from last year, which includes foreign currency exchange favorability of approximately $30 million at current levels. Second, iDEN becomes less of a drag for the second half as about $60 million of our now $80 million expected full year decline will be in the first half the year. And third and finally, meaningful customer engagements and the introduction of several new products should also drive second-half improvement.","In light of the slower recovery in Enterprise, we now expect full year sales growth for the total company of approximately 3% to 4%. This includes expectations for Government growth continuing at low- to mid-single digits and Enterprise growth of low- to mid-single digits reflecting market softness anticipated in the first half. We remain confident in the fundamental drivers of our business and our ability to drive improved operating earnings.","I'll now turn the call over to Ed to provide additional details on the quarter. And then I'll return to discuss the quarter in more detail.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Thanks, Greg. Q1 sales grew 1%, lower than our expectations, as we experienced mixed top line results. Our Government business performed very well, with the exception of Asia. And as Greg stated, the recovery in our core Enterprise business is now expected to occur in the second half of the year.","In Government, we continued to see steady growth. First quarter sales totaled $1.3 billion, an increase of 3% over the prior year quarter. Operating margins in the Government segment improved 200 basis points from 14.1% to 16.1%. Solid sales growth and continued cost efficiency drove the operating margin improvements in this business.","Enterprise business revenues decreased 4% to $627 million in Q1. Excluding the impact of Psion and iDEN, Q1 revenues declined 8%. This compares to a 10% decline in each of Q3 and Q4 of 2012.","Operating margins in the Enterprise business declined from 16.2% to 9.7%. This decline was primarily driven by lower Enterprise product sales volume, the addition of Psion sales and lower iDEN sales.","Operating expenses were $683 million or 34.6% of revenue, which represents a 60-basis-point improvement from the year-ago quarter. This includes the addition of Psion and lower pension expenses versus last year. We remain focused on ensuring our cost structure is aligned to the business needs, and we'll continue to monitor and adjust our spending based on the macro environment.","Our operating earnings for the first quarter were $278 million or 14.1% of sales compared to $290 million or 14.8% in Q1 2012. Total other income and expense was a net expense of $11 million in the quarter compared to a net expense of $3 million in Q1 2012. This amount was higher year-over-year but lower than expected, primarily due to gains on investments. We still expect this line item to be a net expense of approximately $30 million per quarter based on higher interest expense going forward.","I'll now move on to taxes. Our effective tax rate was 30% for the quarter. This amount was lower than expected due to certain discrete items and a change in amounts that are now deemed to be permanently reinvested overseas. Given these items, we now expect an ongoing tax rate of between 32% and 33% versus our previous outlook of 34%.","Cash used by operating activities in the first quarter of 2013 was $31 million as compared to $69 million of cash generated by operating activities in the first quarter of 2012. The lower-than-expected cash flow results were negatively impacted primarily by the timing of long-term contract milestone billings. Q1 was also adversely impacted by a little more than $40 million that we were required to post related to a foreign tax deposit. We expect this amount will be refunded during 2013.","We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and investments and $2.5 billion in debt. During the quarter, we executed a $600 million bond offering at a 3.5% coupon rate as part of our long-term capital allocation plan.","With respect to capital return, we repurchased $357 million of stock or 5.9 million shares at an average price of $60.27 per share in the quarter. Since we began repurchasing shares in Q3 of 2011, we bought back $3.9 billion or 82 million shares at an average price of $47.56. We have $1.1 billion remaining under our current authorization. In addition, we paid $72 million in dividends during the quarter.","Now turning to our Q2 and full year outlook. For Q2, we expect sales to be flat to down 2% compared to the second quarter of 2012. This factors in a flat to slightly down Government business given the very robust 14% growth a year ago and flat Enterprise sales. Our Q2 outlook is for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.66 to $0.71 from continuing operations based on the Q1 ending share count. This compared to non-GAAP EPS in Q2 2012 of $0.70 per share. This outlook excludes stock-based compensation and intangible amortization expenses of approximately $0.13 per share and other items historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings releases.","Moving to full year 2013. Our outlook is now for sales growth of 3% to 4%, which factors in a softer first half for Enterprise than we initially expected. We remain committed to driving operating leverage and continue to plan for full year operating margins of approximately 18%.","I'll now turn it over to Greg for business highlights from the quarter.","Gregory Q. Brown","Thanks, Ed. As previously stated, Government sales for the quarter were up 3% over Q1 2012. Profitability for the business also increased with operating earnings of 16.1% compared to 14.1% in Q1 of last year.","In ASTRO, our industry-leading P25 portfolio, we grew nearly double digits with strong subscriber growth, representing a record Q1. In terms of new contracts, we received a $72 million contract from the State of Tennessee to implement Phase 2 of the Highway Patrol statewide P25 Phase 2 digital communications network. This system will provide the critical communications link to assist Tennessee's troopers in ensuring their state is a safe and secure place in which to live, work and travel.","We were also awarded a $26 million contract by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department to implement a P25 Phase 2 700 megahertz digital radio communications network. This was a competitive win back. And this system will provide critical voice communications for metro officers throughout Clark County, Nevada and expand the interoperable P25 footprint in Southern Nevada.","Wyandotte County in Kansas purchased a $25 million ASTRO system to serve public safety first responders and utility workers. Outside the U.S., we received an ASTRO award for over $70 million, which is our largest ever system sale in Africa and the first phase of a nationwide communications network. And in Brazil, the army recently added a multimillion dollar expansion to their ASTRO system as well.","We continue to innovate for public safety with customer-driven features embedded in our radios. And more than ever, we enable them using software options. Examples of several features in our ASTRO system that are software enabled include efficient spectrum use with Phase 2 TDMA, dual-band functionality and enhanced security and encryption.","Our digital platform continues to enable a smarter and more robust communications network with features such as over-the-air programming, network management utilities and remote diagnostics. The exciting opportunity is that 60% of our customers' public safety networks in the U.S. are still analog and eventually will migrate to digital.","Our TETRA portfolio also had a good quarter with double-digit growth driven by new systems. We continue to execute on our tiering strategy in TETRA. And this quarter we launched the new MTP6750 handheld, the world's first TETRA radio with a 5 megapixel camera. It embeds a special encrypted marking to validate metadata and ensure that images have not been tampered with before being presented in court. Giving front-line officers this tool at the scene of a crime should reduce court time and increase prosecution rates with images used as evidence.","At the recent International TETRA Awards, our Automated RF Coverage Evaluation Solution won recognition for best new innovation. Developed collaboratively with the London Metropolitan Police Service, this network monitoring utility provides automatic visibility of trouble spots on a mission-critical TETRA network and reduces maintenance costs by decreasing the need for testing in problem areas.","Our ASTRO and TETRA mission-critical communication systems help secure mission-critical infrastructure beyond public safety. We've tailored our products to meet the needs of requirements of expanded verticals such as transportation and mining and energy. The Houston Airport, the fourth largest in the U.S., upgraded its command-and-control center with a $4 million investment in Motorola's MCC7500 IP console for critical dispatch needs and daily operations. Combined with their deployment of the new APX subscriber platform, more than 1,000 users efficiently manage operations supporting 36 million travelers annually. And among our international TETRA customers this quarter, we won multimillion-dollar awards with rail transportation systems in Stockholm, Sweden; Klang Valley, Malaysia; Macau, China and Medell\u00edn Metro in Colombia.","Our radios are also designed to operate in harsh environments like petrochemicals and oil and gas. For example, the SIBUR Russian pipeline recently invested in a multimillion dollar TETRA system. In Australia, we're working with Queensland Gas Company on a $4-million enhancement to their TETRA radio network. And Chevron in Thailand recently purchased a TETRA system for their operations.","Additionally, we continue to invest in areas beyond voice and into the command center. Command centers for law enforcement are the backbone for receiving and sending mission-critical voice and data, enabling situational awareness for first responders to be more effective. As public safety increasingly leverages big data, our capabilities are once again addressing key needs. Our new Real-Time Crime Center solution integrates radio consoles and video over existing carrier and private wireless networks, while incorporating public- and private-sector cameras. The Real-Time Crime Center solution provides a foundation for agencies to operationalize predictive policing strategies and use analytics to realize the full promise of technology investments in voice and video. The city of Malden, Massachusetts is an early adopter of our Real-Time Crime Center and recently implemented an integrated public safety video surveillance network incorporating over 30 video cameras located throughout the city.","In Public Safety LTE, we continue to work with our North America customers, while several of them are negotiating spectrum lease arrangements with FirstNet following their February board meeting. We're also pursuing international opportunities and innovating with products like our new LTE modem, the VML700, which interoperates on a carrier and Public Safety LTE network. The modem works on a public carrier LTE network and can also act as a mobile 802.11 WiFi hotspot while our customers plan for a public-safety grade LTE network. This VML700 enables new media-rich applications like photos, geomapping or streaming video in the vehicle.","Another testament to our leadership position this quarter, we were the first Public Safety LTE vendor to successfully complete the latest interoperability testing activities with the Public Safety Communications Research Program located at the Department of Commerce. And our LEX 700 LTE handheld device for public safety is now available to ship.","For our federal customers, we released a new product design to serve their agencies that need secure voice and data communications. The AME 2000 is based on Motorola's Assured Mobile Environment solution, which combines a commercial off-the-shelf Android device with hardware and software to provide end-to-end encrypted voice and data communications through private or public wireless networks to support the missions of federal agencies. This new mobile device, combined with our CRYPTR micro encryption unit, provides federal-government-level data security to mobile devices.","Moving on to our Enterprise segment. Sales in Enterprise were $627 million, a decrease of 4% from Q1 of 2012. Operating earnings declined to 9.7% of sales from 16.2% last year, driven by negative leverage from lower sales, iDEN declines and the addition of Psion revenues, which will carry lower than segment margins as we continue to drive margin improvement in that business. Within the Enterprise portfolio, our business was down primarily due to the iDEN decline, wireless LAN declining over 30% and the Enterprise mobile computing business declining single digits without Psion.","In addition, a large base of legacy applications deployed by our Enterprise customers are written in Microsoft's legacy OS, which is aging. As a result, customers are contemplating a transition to Android or the future Windows Phone 8 embedded operating system. Although this doesn't impact all of our customers, it has resulted in delays for several customer projects. Now that said, we do have a dual OS strategy with Microsoft and its variants in our Enterprise secure version of Android. We continue to deployed Windows CE and embedded handheld 6.5.3 products, and we're strategically partnering with Microsoft on their release of the next generation of Windows-embedded handheld based on Windows 8.","We've also launched Android products, and the ecosystem is growing in Enterprise. And more importantly, we've offered our customers an OS agnostic solution in Rhomobile, a tuck-in acquisition we made a while ago, which I remind you is an HTML5 framework that enables right ones run many applications.","We've also ramped up our new product launches over the last few months, especially on the Enterprise mobile computing side, with updates to core products, like the MC92 and MC67. We've also brought to market several new category-expanding Enterprise mobile computing products like the MC40, the Smart Badge 1 and MC45 and our MP6000 multi-plane scanner, which is our first entry into an entirely new market for us in bioptic scanning. The updated core products are playing well competitively, especially the MC92 and MC67, which represent the leading products in their respective categories. And we're also seeing good pilot interest and funnel expansion for some of our newer portfolio.","Our Enterprise business is purpose built, with solutions designed for working closely with our customers to meet their unique business requirements. For example, we launched 2 new wearable devices designed to increase efficiency and accuracy in inventory and warehouse distribution.","Our new and improved wearable mobile computer enables warehouse associates to keep their eyes and hands on moving materials and frees them from paperwork. Accompanying with our wearable finger Ring Scanner, it combines effortless scanning and task accuracy verification. Our innovation in this space resulted in multimillion-dollar awards this quarter from 2 parcel and delivery companies in the U.S.","Among our transportation and logistics customers on track, a regional parcel carrier that serves the Western U.S. continued their $4 million rollout of MC9500s for their delivery fleet. Tesco continues to invest in our MC17 retail mobile computers, which enables a personal shopping experience in their stores, with a $3 million order this quarter for an additional 100 stores. We designed this product working closely with Tesco, allowing customers to scan items while they shop, efficiently check out and target promotions with buying patterns. We were also awarded a contract to supply Dutch retailer Sligro with MC17 devices for use in 30 of their largest stores.","On the RFID front, Macy's has been a leader in the adoption of RFID in retail. And this quarter, they continued to invest in our RFID solutions for their stores, which increase inventory accuracy and enhance productivity.","At the recent ProMAC conference, we demonstrated our comprehensive supply chain solutions from manufacturing to distribution to retail outlets. Our comprehensive offerings are now complemented with Psion's rugged modular offerings to the manufacturing and supply chain verticals. One Psion product that exemplifies this rugged design is the Omni XT15, a handheld device designed specifically for operation in hazardous conditions including pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, utilities, chemical and other manufacturing applications.","We're encouraged by the early interest we've experienced with our new category-expanding device, the MC40. This multifunction device is designed for inventory management, as well as point-of-sale and voice. For front of the store, it provides a robust alternative to a consumer device with the durability that is core to our devices and a sleek pocketable design with touch screen interface.","We are working with some customers who previously explored consumer grade devices with attached sleds and found them to be inadequate point-of-sale solutions because of lack of durability, shortfalls with voice and push-to-talk clients and a lack of enterprise-level support. Our solution meets these requirements, supports multiple applications in 1 device with a built-in card reader, includes full-shift battery life with user-swappable batteries and a secure operating system that enables multiple users to have unique login and security credentials.","Now before turning to a regional overview of the company, I wanted to explain some changes to our regional reporting structure. In January, we realigned our regions under a new geographic structure. Sales in the Middle East are now included with Asia, forming a region that we now call APME. We also installed a new leader in January in APME as well. And our sales in Europe and Africa form a region called EA, and we've included a historical schedule of the performance of these regions with this quarter's earnings release. And Mark, I'm sure, may have the opportunity to elaborate further on the regional structure later during the call.","Moving on to the regional results this quarter for the total company. With respect to the Americas, North America sales increased 1% with continued strength in Government, up 6%, while the Enterprise business declined double digits. Latin America performed well this quarter, both Government and the Enterprise, without iDEN, increased double digits. Including iDEN, Latin America was down 3%.","Turning to Europe and Africa, we grew 13%, driven by double-digit growth in both Government and Enterprise. Including our Psion acquisition, the Enterprise business declined mid-single digits.","Finally, in Asia Pac and Middle East, sales declined 13%, driven by a significant double-digit decline in Government. The Government business in Asia declined across the portfolio, and the Enterprise business grew mid-single digits year-on-year. We still anticipate full year growth in Asia Pac and Middle East overall.","A couple of other final comments. We also received top recognition from CRN's 2013 Partner Program Guide awarding PartnerEmpower, our PartnerEmpower channel program, a 5-star rating. CRN recognizes an elite subset of vendors that provide the best partnering elements in their channel programs. Our 20,000-plus partners are an extension of Motorola that scales globally and complements our direct sales organization. In fact, many of our partners have been with us for decades and are proud to exclusively represent our products.","It is also worth highlighting that we were also honored with an unprecedented 5 Red Dot Product Design Awards, including recognition of innovative designs for our new MC40 mobile computer and the  MOTOTRBO SL radio and mobile radio control head. Now the Red Dot Awards, as they're affectionately known, is one of the most internationally acclaimed design competitions dating back over 70 years. And the Red Dot is an internationally recognized seal of quality.","In conclusion, our Q1 revenues were softer than we anticipated, driven by mixed results. Looking forward, the Government business remains solid. And within Enterprise, we expect second half improvements from customer engagement and new products, as well as a benefit from lower comps and favorable foreign exchange. We remain focused on driving revenue growth, earnings improvement, cash flow and shareholder return.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks, Greg. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I guess, I wanted to follow up. First, I guess a little more clarification on the weakness or missed execution or how would you clarify it in terms of the Asia Pacific business? And what steps are you taking to turn around that trend? And then secondly, although I understand the guidance, I'd like to understand kind of the levers you could pull if the full year turns out to look a lot more like Q1 in terms of flattish year-over-year growth. Could you still get to margin expansion, or does it require some top line growth to get there?","Mark F. Moon","So, Tavis, I'll take the first piece of that question. I think we talked about through several quarters of last year, that we were not pleased with our performance in Asia. As you remember, we reported single-digit growth in both Government and Enterprise last year. At the end of the year we decided to make some changes though, structurally, as we kind of expanded our sales coverage and went to more regional leadership. We also made a leadership change within the region. We're bringing in a new leader by the name of Mohammed Akhtar who had previously led the Middle East, but prior to that assignment had served 15 years within Asia and had wonderful experience with Motorola as within the region. This particular quarter, we also did not perform as well as we had hoped. And similar to the Enterprise story, I do believe it will be second-half driven. As Greg said though, we do still expect for the Asian region to be mid- to high-single digit growth for the year. If you think about the quarter in particular though, the quarter was really driven by a couple of countries around the region that had some anomalies. While I'm not making excuses for our performance, Malaysia was down $12 million as a result of the roll off of the Royal Malaysian Police project. India and Australia were down $8 million and $6 million, respectively, with large projects that happened the previous year. And then China and Japan were both down $7 million. We continue to experience some pressure in China, both macroeconomically, as well as localization pressure around the PDT standard for our PCR-type of business. So we continue to be pressured there. But as I said, we've put the steps in place to turn that business around. I'm confident in the leadership. I'm confident in the moves that we've made. And I think you'll see steady improvement as we move throughout the year.","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes, on the full year outlook, Tavis, obviously we spent a lot of time on it. We believe primarily as the Government business continues to moderate, I think pretty solidly and still grow off of record comps the previous year. That's also why we think when we guide Q2 to flat to slightly down, we're flat to down 2%. That's also embedded in that with a record 14% quarter than the previous period for Government. At the end of the day, it primarily comes down to Enterprise. We think we're taking a pretty prudent approach. The full year guidance still does expect, as you asked specifically, some top line growth. That's expected for the second half and for the full year. Now that said, I'll tell you, I'd like to think it's in the DNA of this management team to continually manage costs pretty aggressively, which is why we're reiterating our commitment to operating leverage and still targeting approximately an 18% operating margin for the full year this year, irrespective of what the top line growth is.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","So, Tavis, but as you know as we've talked about, we need top line growth to drive leverage and to improve operating margins. We are assuming that top line 3% to 4%, but we do think that 18% is achievable based upon our view of spending. There was some level of investment assumed in our prior guidance that we have now pulled back on, and that's why we do believe we can get that 18%. And as Greg said, it's in the DNA of the organization that everyone knows what they need to do. If the top line's softer, we don't make the investments that we had planned to make. So that's all factored into what we guided here.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A follow-up to the -- one of the prior questions about Asia not performing well. It sounds like you've got a grasp on what happened there. But I'm a little unclear. Maybe you can take another shot at about what are you guys are doing here to resolve this? Is it -- do you need to have a bigger footprint there? Do you need stronger sales force people? Is it more channel work through? Or do you need to withdraw more or make more M&A there? How are you going to resolve these Asia challenges that you're seeing?","Mark F. Moon","So, Jim, I think in short, it's a little bit of all of what you just mentioned. When we look back over the last several years, we were fortunate in Asia to have steady growth even through 2009; when we declined in other regions, we had growth. But in retrospect, when we look at that, that growth was really centered around China and Australia and some large projects. What we recognized last year is that we didn't have the proper strategy and resources in the areas that we see for future growth, the emerging countries like Indonesia, India, Thailand, Vietnam. So what we've done is rebalanced our resources. When I talked about a new sales coverage model, that's exactly what we did, both from a leadership perspective, as well as augmenting some resources from outside of the region with subject matter expertise to help kick start that growth in these new areas. So combined with the overall leadership, I think that we've taken the steps to go do that. I do think it will take time. That's why I talked about second-half driven. But we really do understand, and I think the opportunity for growth within that region is certainly still there.","Gregory Q. Brown","And, Jim, just to accentuate, we think it's organic investments. So when you kind of inventory the main items for the Asia recovery plan, it's leadership, marketing, channel management, sales coverage. Which basically represent organic investment and a reprioritization of capital deployment that we have every intention of making.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then as a follow-up, switching gears to the Enterprise side of things. Is that more macro driven in enterprise budgets and uncertainty and just given the overall macro issues? Or is there something that MSI -- Motorola Solutions can do to kind of surpass and get around the challenges that have kind of been persistent on the Enterprise side as far as products or rollouts? Or how should we think about overcoming those headwinds?","Gregory Q. Brown","So, Jim, I think that there's a few factors. I think it's primarily macroeconomic driven, which has resulted in customers deferring some purchases. Now Q1 was challenging on the Enterprise side, and it actually got a little bit more challenging toward the latter half of March. I also reference though, in my earlier comments, there is this uncertainty around operating system transition. Remember the mobile computing environment, which is the bulk of our Enterprise business, is virtually a 100% Microsoft installed base. Customers with Windows CE, customers with Windows-embedded handheld, they want a roadmap on how they transition from their OS environment to the new Microsoft environment. And that's work that we're still working with Microsoft on. I was on a call recently -- yesterday with the development teams and Steve Ballmer and myself, and we're working on a few client opportunities to ensure and target getting a new Microsoft release product piloted by the end of the year. So that's also a component. Now having said all that, remember our wireless LAN business declined over 30%. That's not market driven. That's a failure to execute on our part. And we are transition -- we've transitioned from moving from a product sale to a managed services sale on WLAN, and we're not doing a good enough job. And the next few months will be critical for us to get more traction and grow that business of opportunity. And then lastly, Jim, the iDEN business was down pretty sharply in Q1. Most of it was anticipated, but quite frankly, iDEN was down even more than we thought. It was a $32 million year-over-year decline. And for the full year, we now expect iDEN to be about $185 million full year in '13 coming off of $265 million the previous year. So actually the overall decline in iDEN is a little bit more pronounced than we originally thought.","Operator","And your next question comes from Peter Misek with Jefferies.","Peter Misek - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","First question is on capital returns. Can you give us an update on where we are with that process and leveraging off of the balance sheet. And then I have a couple operational questions.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Sure. So just high level, we're obviously very pleased with the progress we've made with the program, the share repurchase program thus far. Got a little over 20% of our share base being reduced since the inception of the program, 82 million shares, $3.9 billion, an average price of $47.56. This quarter, we did another $357 million at an average price of $60.27, bringing our ending share count at the end of the quarter to 272 million shares. We have about $1.1 billion remaining in the program as of the end of the quarter. And I'd say, kind of our thought process going forward, Greg can add to it, is we'll maintain a flexibility to be opportunistic in the execution of repurchases as we've done in the past. So you should expect that same mantra going forward.","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes. I mean we've clearly demonstrated our commitment to capital return to the shareholder, now approaching $4 billion. You've seen the levels we've purchased back, at what prices. By the way, at the end of the day, all in, we feel very good about the value created with that whole process. And we will continue to be opportunistic going forward to maximize shareholder return.","Peter Misek - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick operational questions. First is, how should we think about currency and FX going forward? Obviously very volatile swings in the yen, but we've also had some big movements in the euro. How should we look at that for the remainder of the year? What assumptions are we -- should we be modeling? And then lastly, as we look at the Government business, higher level and maybe a little bit longer term or qualitatively, you made some comments on the analog to digital switchover. How much of that equipment is installed? How should we look at that progression as we approach the 2018 cutoff deadline? If you could help there qualitatively, that would be great.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","So on the FX front, if you recall last year, Q3 in particular was the big dip and for us the biggest euro -- the biggest impact on FX is the euro. So when declined last year fairly significantly, it caused effectively, I think it was a $40-million-or-thereabouts decline in sales in Q3 that we talked about. At rates where they are today with the euro at about $1.3, that causes for the second half of the year, in fact a lot of it in Q3, a $30-million improvement in Q3 and a little bit more for the full year. So that's the way we're thinking. Our guidance is factoring in current rates, assuming they stay where they are. And that's the impact that Greg talked about on the call.","Mark F. Moon","Peter, as you think about the Government business as we've talked about, we've been very pleased with how resilient the Government business continues to be. Last year, as we talked about the real strength, there was a lot of talk about narrowbanding, which certainly had an impact in North America. But at the same time, we talked a lot each quarter about new product introductions, the expansion of analog to digital. We also talked about the benefits of that and of aging infrastructure. The comment Greg made earlier about 60% of our customers in North America are still analog, worldwide, 50% of our customers are still analog. So as we go forward, given that aging infrastructure, the benefits of moving from analog to digital, as well as the things that we just talked about, the need that drive -- these fundamental drivers that are still present within Government, it helps us to continue to be optimistic. We've talked about the Government business being low- to mid-single digits. I think as we continue to put out new products, once LTE takes hold as we talked about and will talk about further, LTE has been somewhat delayed. And we think that moves the Government business to continue to be in solid mid-single-digit kind of a growth business.","Operator","And our next question comes from the side of Stanley Kovler with Morgan Stanley.","Stanley Kovler - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm calling in for Ehud Gelblum. I just wanted to ask you on the mobile computing side, are you seeing any impact from, as you mentioned consumer-oriented devices like iPad, iPhone, I mean, help us quantify that? And in terms of the mix of Microsoft versus Android going forward, how do you anticipate that change shifting perhaps to more Android? What percentage of the portfolio or of that business could go potentially to Android? Then I have a clarification.","Gregory Q. Brown","So you kind of clicked in and out. I think what you were asking was about Microsoft to Android transition. And then also the consumer device potential substitution in mobile computing. Is that what you were saying?","Stanley Kovler - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, that's correct.","Gregory Q. Brown","Okay, so on the Microsoft side or the operating system side, obviously we ship both. We do Microsoft and Android. I've described already the conversations with Microsoft at the highest levels of the company to ensure a roadmap for our installed base customers of Microsoft. Now 2 of our newest products, the MC40 and the ET1 tablet, now WAN enabled, are both Android. It's also worth noting that what we do is we, Motorola, take off-the-shelf Android and then with our development team under Girish Rishi, put specific enterprise features around that, on device management, security, encryption and the like. And we will continue to do that. So I think that you'll see us continue to ship more Android product, of course, in 2013 and '14, and have more than a couple of products on Android. We will work with Microsoft to transition the legacy installed base. And also we probably have a few dozen customers that have invested in RhoMobile, which was the tuck-in acquisition we did. And again, that whole reason is kind of an insurance policy that lets a customer install RhoMobile software, which is operating system agnostic and provides an application framework that they can run -- write once and run many, irrespective on the OS underlying the specific device. On the consumerization, if you will, as some people like to call it, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, there are a couple of positive signs where customers have looked to deploy either an Android device or an Apple iOS device. And for a variety of reasons, have come back to us, whether it's durability, whether it's overall post-sale support on application refresh or break fix or inventory management or helpdesk support. Having an enterprise device is different than trying to just take a consumer device and slap it into an enterprise framework. We are cautiously optimistic that the MC40, as well as the overall feature and service capabilities that we bring to the table, could mitigate some of the front-facing store operations on the terms of the consumerization or use of a consumer-grade device. It's still in transition. I don't know if Mark wants to add anything to that. But I think generally we're well positioned, and stay tuned.","Mark F. Moon","Yes, I think the comment was exactly right. We talked about in the past, there's certainly been a presence of consumer devices moving into the front of the store. As we've said, I think that's also a positive because it increases the visibility and the need for mobility. And as we've said in the past, all ships rise with the tide. At the same time we're expanding our portfolio, as Greg said, the MC40, the MC45, the Smart Badge. So we're beginning to move from this traditional rugged line worker, which is still the heart of our business, move back up so that we have offerings in the front of the store as well.","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes, that's an important point. Remember, as you look at our rugged mobile computing business, it's typically blue collar, concrete, warehouse, purpose built. The front-facing store fight between our MC40 or a consumer-grade device, we look at more as opportunistic than a cannibalization or a core threat to the heart and soul of what we do on rugged devices.","Stanley Kovler - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then on the financials, going back to the Enterprise margins. Is it just a matter of higher revenue to improve margins, or is there anything related to mix that will also change, iDEN obviously going down a little bit more than you expected, impacting the operating margin there. Maybe you can clarify what else gets you back up in terms of operating margin there. And just a little bit more color on the taxes going down, if you could help there.","Gregory Q. Brown","So I think Ed and I will tag team this. But you're right. On the margin profile of Enterprise, the contraction is partly due to a more accelerated decline of iDEN, which has a different gross margin profile. It's also the incorporation of Psion, which has lower gross margins at the moment as we integrate that acquisition. By the way, the overall integration of Psion, I think, is going well. And we will work, over time, to get the economies of scale in the supply chain to take the gross margin profile of their products directionally more in line with the gross margin profile of our Enterprise portfolio. And on tax?","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","Yes, so -- and just also a few more things on the margin side. Really, you said it right. It's really volume. As the volumes go down at the gross margin level of this business, it hurts the operating margin. So volume is probably the biggest contributor to the operating margin decline. The gross margin decline we've talked about, really the mix of Psion and iDEN, as well as a few -- a shift between product and services mix, which brought the gross margins down for the full year. As Greg said, I'd say in the aggregate as well, our view is that we should be driving operating margin improvement. As we get to a full year view of low- to mid-single digit growth in the Enterprise business, we should see operating margin expansion as you look at the firm with the mix of iDEN going down. That may be a bit more challenging in the aggregate, but if you exclude that piece of it, for sure we're going to be driving operating margin improvement.","Gregory Q. Brown","And he had a tax question, I think.","Edward J. Fitzpatrick","And on the tax piece our -- we've guided previously to 34%. We had a 30% effective tax rate this quarter. About 2.5% of that was related to the discrete items that I had mentioned related to international and certain U.S. tax adjustments. Those aren't necessarily recurring. However, there's a 1.5% decline that we will be using to record our taxes going forward in the ongoing rate, which we now expect to be from the 34%, now down between 32% and 33% related to our assertion that in certain countries our earnings in those countries will be permanently reinvested based upon our assessments. This all goes to our overall strategy of ensuring we have cash where we need it, when we need it, particularly in international jurisdictions so that cash becomes much more fungible going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to dig in a little bit more into the Enterprise segment just to make sure I understand the comments. So I think you talked about some uncertainty in the installed base, which is virtually 100% in Microsoft, and some of the products you're highlighting as addressing some of the interest in Android such as the MC40 and the ET1. They're more, as I understand, front of the store kind of products. So can you just comment a little bit on whether the installed base is looking at Android as an operating system for the traditional back of the store, concrete floor types of applications where you've focused on? And if that's the case, then if you can just outline a bit more on the Android roadmap in that area.","Gregory Q. Brown","I think, Simona, at the moment, I would characterize the consideration for Android as more front-facing customer store. So -- and we're also refreshing the MC67, MC9500 and some traditional products. Now it all depends ultimately on the speed and pace of development of the new OS by Microsoft. But I'd characterize it more around customer facing. Mark, I don't know what you think.","Mark F. Moon","Yes, I completely agree. When you think about back office, rugged, you usually don't have touch screen kind of devices. You're not as worried about that, if you will, consumer user interface. And there's a lot of investment. As Greg has mentioned in the past, almost 100% of all vendors, not just Motorola, of those kinds of devices are Microsoft based. Therein lies some of this delay and the interest from the industry in the next generation from Microsoft of what they're going to go do. At the same time though, we do want to provide options as we go forward, and that's what we're continuing to do. I do think the exciting piece of all of this is, while we have been slow to ramp up in our sales of large projects, and we've talked about that for the last several quarters, it is encouraging both engagement with customers. I was also at a recent partner event with our top 100 partners and there was excitement actually about their engagements, our new products, what we're talking about, roadmaps. And our actual funnel activity has really increased quarter-over-quarter strong double digits. And in fact, the large project funnels, those over $15 million, have increased 25%. So while we know we've got to go execute in Enterprise, and we've talked about it being second-half driven, it is encouraging that we're seeing good signs that, that will indeed happen.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And when you talked about having a new Microsoft-release product piloted by the end of the year, can you just expand on that? Is that something that you're waiting on Microsoft to release? Or is it something that you are going to release? And doesn't that imply that we wouldn't really expect to see much improvement in that area until that product is out?","Gregory Q. Brown","Well, again, so characterize it more as customer-front facing. And we're already shipping product with the MC40 with Android and specific enterprise features around that. Simona, yes, we will wait for Microsoft to give us a release of the successor to Windows-embedded handheld. And then we will take it, and test it, and certify it along with the necessary wireless carriers here in the States like Verizon and AT&T. So yes, but we're working -- the 2 development teams are working pretty closely on the architecture of the system, the chipset design, the timing of different releases. But yes, we are working with and primarily waiting on. But it is a very iterative discussion again that I referenced we had as late as yesterday and we'll continue to have over the next few months.","Mark F. Moon","The other important point around that though is, so that you don't think that they'll just wait on this new product. We talked about earlier, and Greg mentioned, that we are OS agnostic. And this solution with Rhomobile allows customers to not only move forward with Android, but move forward as well with existing Microsoft products that we're offering as we've gone forward. We've talked about actually upgrading some of our good strong sellers that are leading the industry. So while there's this interest in the future roadmap, there's still compelling reasons right now to move forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","First question has to do with the services. It appears that services increased or the percentage of business quite a bit over, I guess, last year. How should we look at this going forward? Should we expect to stay at this level or continue increasing?","Mark F. Moon","Yes, I think we talked about last year, both at the financial analyst meeting and through the quarters, that we've continued to expand our services capability, and we want to continue to do that as we think about solutions for customers. And as we talk to customers in the field, they're asking us to look at integrating more components of their overall needs. So our services piece is expanding, and we see that happening as we go forward. With that said, I think when Ed talked earlier about the Enterprise mix, the increase in services as a percentage of equipment in Enterprise this past quarter was really driven, not as much by strategy but more by the lack of sales volume of Enterprise equipment, which impacted the margin. So I think as we go forward, what we've talked about is, even with this increase in service, we continue to believe that we can maintain our operating margins and our course of continued operating margin improvement.","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes, the thing I would add, Keith, is that we will stay close to the core on services. So we're not going to stray too far on things that are not core to our business. So I point you back to a great opportunity that we capitalized in Norway, where we're operating under the services banner a multiyear TETRA network. I just returned from Australia last week. Australia is arguably probably the best managed services theater that we have in the world, both on MMR, LAN mobile radio, as well as a mobile data network. And there's other opportunities there as well. And then lastly, the other opportunity is both on Government and our rugged mobile computing I would characterize around life cycle managed services. So if some customers may opt to not buy mobile computing devices, but in turn have us do it, have us do the technology refresh, have us price a managed services engagement that allow us to manage the device portfolio and provide them a cost per user or a monthly charge, we'll do that. So things around public safety, Public Safety LTE and the rugged mobile computing space, represent very good service opportunities that are adjacent to our core and that can be used to capitalize on our domain expertise.","Operator","And our next question from Kulbinder Garcha with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick question for Greg. I know you kind of touched up on this. But on the Enterprise business, it seems over the last year to 1.5 years, there's been various reasons why revenues haven't come through, whether it's macro or big deals being pushed out, now wireless LAN and then the OS transition. I'm just wondering, is a more structural portfolio review being done? Is that being considered? And I see the point that Ed made on maybe pulling back on investments, but what about actually looking to actually lower the cost base in that business if the -- if you don't see the recovery in the second half, how do you see that [indiscernible]?","Gregory Q. Brown","So, Kulbinder, couple of things. On rugged mobile computing, you're right. It's been sluggish for a few quarters. As we articulated, we expect a thoughtful second half return for the reasons we've described. That said, it also really was very, very strong for probably 6 to 8 quarters prior to this latest downturn. So it's a great core business for us, but it does have more cyclicality and swings that are more susceptible than macroeconomic than the steady, stable, more predictable Government business where we have a stronger position. And quite frankly, we're between the age of the infrastructure narrowbanding, the global move from analog to digital and a whole host of other reasons, while that business is more stable. We still believe and I still believe that in the core of our Enterprise business, this downturn is more cyclical than structural. Now we'll always be mindful and be careful not to drink our own Kool-Aid and continually re-examine the different drivers of the business, but I still think it's more cyclical. WLAN, to your point, is different. That's a business -- that's an overall market that's north -- that addressable market's north of $4 billion or $4.5 billion. We have consistently lost share in WLAN, and we just haven't executed that well. Now it is a little bit more embryonic in terms of our strategic change from product to managed services, but we've got to do a better job. So I distinguished when we talk about \"the Enterprise business,\" I distinguish WLAN from rugged mobile computing and data capture. In rugged mobile computing and data capture, we're #1 worldwide. We've talked about the design expertise, the installed base, leading market share, a new product portfolio. WLAN is different. And we've got to turn that corner relatively soon, and we're going to keep a close watch on that business over the next few months. Having said all that, we will continue to manage the cost structure appropriately. We're committed, irrespective of revenue levels, to get at the 18% operating margin that I think the business can yield from an operating leverage standpoint. And going forward, we will always look to expand that, as well as operating earnings and operating margin expansion.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Andrew Spinola with Wells Fargo.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'll follow up on that question, actually. Maybe more specifically, if I think about your -- the longer-term operating margin in the Enterprise business, it's obviously been trending down the last couple years. How do you think about that? Are you willing to say, is it -- can that be a mid-double-digit operating margin business? And what gets you back to that?","Gregory Q. Brown","I think it can be a double-digit operating margin business. What gets us back to that is return to growth at the top line, the traction and acceptance of new products; for us to take the expanded funnel that Mark described and convert it to sales; for us to capitalize in Asia, as an example; the improvement of channel management and sales coverage in certain theaters there; and the continued discipline around cost structure. So I think we can do that. By the way, just even though this isn't specific, you were talking more about Enterprise, I do want to just mention Government and Public Safety LTE that Mark referenced earlier. We had talked about Public Safety LTE being no more than $100 million primarily in the second half of this year in '13. And as we revised our total outlook for the year of 3% to 4% revenue growth, we've gone through what we think that yields on the Enterprise side. We think that LTE overall is probably now no more than $50 million for the full year, largely in the second half, driven by taking a little bit longer to close some international sales and the continued elongated process with FirstNet here in the States. And I just want to make sure I communicated that all to you in a very open and transparent way.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And can I ask one follow-up? Just on Q2, the Government revenue growth rate is a little bit less than what it was in Q1. And I knew you got a tough comp there. The Q2 '12 was the strongest quarter. But wondered if you can just put a little color around that. I'm thinking sort of bigger picture. Is there any, are there any funding issues at the state and government levels, a sequester or anything, driving that? It sounds like Q1 was partly or largely due to this Asia Pacific issue with the professional and commercial. Is it more of that in Q2? Or what are some of the different trends that are slowing the growth rate in Q2?","Mark F. Moon","Yes, so I think you hit on the first piece, is we've talked about the slightly tougher comp, 14% growth in the previous year in Government. As we talked about, while the business is a very, very steady, given some of the very large projects, it can also be a little lumpy. And we have a little bit of that when we talked about we're still -- the full year is solid. We saw a very strong first quarter. So we have a piece of that as well. Also, what you talked about around the PCR is you spoke of, that was primarily the driver in Asia -- the Asia region of Government, but PCR also slowed as we talked about in the end of the first quarter. So that's a little bit in the second quarter as well. Also, in the second quarter, the impact of rebanding in the second quarter and as we go forward becomes a little bit more pronounced than it was in the first quarter when you talk about year-on-year comparables. While we talked about last year rebanding impacting approximately 3% of our growth, it looks like, as we were also working against that headwind, which also plays in the PCR market, as well as some of our systems business. So all in all, I think as I've said earlier, the Government business will continue to perform very resilient, but the second quarter in particular is really driven by comps, some large projects as we talk about, the funnel's still growing, and just the normal nature. Usually when we look at really volumes in the Government business, first quarter and second quarter historical national volumes have been very similar. So coming against that comp, really kind of -- or moves to the difference in growth rates.","Operator","I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks.","Shep Dunlap","All right, thanks.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Greg.","Greg Brown","Thanks, Shep, and good afternoon and thanks everybody for joining us. I'd like to make a few opening comments before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. First, Q4 was actually a good quarter in terms of margin expansion and cash flow generation. Managed and support services grew 7% adjusted for currency, and North America also outperformed our expectations against the difficult prior year compare and we saw solid growth in Asia Pac.","Second, when I think of the full year, 2015 was a year of transformation and achievement that positions us well going forward. We delivered $830 million of free cash flow, took out over $210 million of operating costs, returned $3.5 billion in capital to shareholders, increased our quarterly dividend by 21%, and improved the efficiency of our capital structure.","And finally, last Friday, we announced the close of Airwave acquisition, which is a strong and important addition to our services franchise. Airwave owns and operates one of the largest public safety radio networks in the world and will provide a platform to expand our managed services business on a global basis.","This business has significant managed services infrastructure and operational assets that could be leveraged for future growth opportunities in this space. The addition of airwave increases our recurring revenue streams by 50%, adds geographic diversification, delivers another source of robust free cash flow, and the transaction is cash and earnings accretive in year one.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts.","Gino Bonanotte","Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon everyone. Key Q4 highlights include revenue of $1.7 billion, down 8% versus last year, and down 5% in constant currency. The primary drivers of the decline were currency and economic headwinds in Latin America and Eastern Europe. In addition, the Norway nationwide network transition from systems integration to managed services contributed to lower revenues.","Ending backlog was up $698 million versus last year and up $486 million sequentially. Multi-year managed and support contracts continue to drive backlog growth. GAAP operating earnings were $389 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $458 million, or 27% of sales, representing a 70 basis point improvement in the prior year. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.56, compared to a loss of $4.02 in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to pension restructuring.","Non-GAAP EPS of $1.58 was up 26% year-over-year. The EPS growth was driven primarily by cost reductions and lower share count due to repurchases. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted. For the full-year, revenue declined 3%, but was flat in constant currency.","EBITDA grew 6% to $1.3 billion. Operating earnings increased 230 basis points to 20.5% of sale. Earnings per share grew 29% to $3.33 per share. Free cash flow was $830 million, and free cash flow per share was $4.11, which has grown double-digits since separation in 2011.","Moving to product segment results for the quarter, Q4 product sales were $1.1 billion, down 10% versus the prior year, and down 7% in constant currency. The decline is attributable primarily to FX and economic headwinds in Latin America and Eastern Europe. Q4 product operating income was $340 million, or 30% of sales.","Ending product segment backlog was $1.2 billion, up $40 million versus last year. The year-over-year backlog increase reflects growth in Asia-Pac, the Middle East and North America, offset by declines in Europe and Latin America.","Turning to services, Q4 services revenue was $557 million, down 3%. Excluding currency impact in iDEN, the services business grew 2%. Managed and support services grew 7% in constant currency with growth in every region. Services operating income was $118 million, or 21% of revenue, up $29 million from last year.","Services operating margins were up 580 basis points and improved gross margin and OpEx reductions. As expected margin improvement was driven by the completion of several large systems installations, including the Norway project. Services backlog ended at $5.2 billion, up $658 million versus last year, and up $601 million sequentially.","Customers continued to sign long-term services contracts to upgrade, maintain, and manage their networks. $340 million of this backlog increase was driven by our recent Public Safety LTE contract win in the United Kingdom. Backlog was up solidly in all regions except Latin America.","Moving to Q4 operating expenses; total OpEx from continuing operations was $386 million, down $45 million, or 10% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost reduction activities and a stronger dollar. For the year, OpEx is down $212 million or 12%. The largest drivers of the decline include employee reductions in G&A, pension expense and favorability from currency. We have now taken out over $550 million of OpEx in the last three years.","Q4 other income and expense was up $12 million to $51 million compared to the year-ago quarter. The increase was due to additional interest expense. Looking at taxes, the Q4 effective tax rate was 31%. Full year 2015 effective tax rate was 33%. Our cash tax rate was 11% for 2015 and we continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% through 2019.","Turning to cash flow; Q4 operating cash flow was $414 million and free cash flow was $370 million. These results were driven by aggressive OpEx reductions and improved working capital efficiency. We ended Q4 in a net debt position of $2.4 billion. We also repurchased $179 million of stock at $69.23. The lower buyback levels for the quarter were due to blackout restrictions for the Airwave transaction, which was pending at the time.","Total capital return for the quarter was $239 million, inclusive of dividends. We also increased the dividend by 21% during Q4 to $0.41 per share. Program to date, we have repurchased $11 billion, or 49% of our shares outstanding, at an average price of $57.06 a share. I\u2019ll now provide our outlook for both Q1 and the full-year inclusive of Airwave. Looking at Q1, we expect Q1 sales to decline 4% to 6% including currency, which is expected to be $20 million of translational headwind. This outlook includes approximately $55 million of revenue from Airwave.","The decline in Q1 is driven by three items: the Norway contract transition finishing the systems integration phase, continued weakness in Latin America and currency headwinds. We expect non-GAAP EPS between $0.37 and $0.42 per share. For the full year, we expect total company sales, for 2016, to increase 5% to 7%, including approximately $450 million of revenue associated with Airwave. We expect operating expenses to be $1.45 billion, down another $120 million versus 2015, inclusive of Airwave, or $150 million in savings in the core business. ","We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.62 billion to $1.66 billion, an increase of approximately 25%. We expect EPS in the range of $4.45 to $4.65 per share, an increase of approximately 30% versus 2015. This EPS outlook reflects an average diluted share count of 170 million to 175 million shares. We expect operating cash flow of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and free cash flow of $825 million to $900 million, resulting in free cash flow per share in the range of $4.75 to $5 per share.","Moving to Q4 regional results with comments on both Q4 and 2016. North American Q4 was down 1% and flat in constant currency. Services in North America grew 2% for the quarter. For full-year 2015, North America posted 3% growth. We\u2019re pleased to finish 2015 with continued execution and expect 2016 sales growth to once again be in the low single digits as we improve sales coverage and capture value for new features and services.","In Q4, Latin America was down due to continued economic weakness, a stronger dollar and a decline in iDEN. Revenue declined $58 million or 42% with Brazil representing the largest decline. Although, we expect Latin America to be down in 2016, our outlook is for the decline to be much more concentrated in the first half of the year.","In Q4, Europe and Africa was down 21%, excluding FX, sales were down 14%. The Norway transition to managed services and continued weakness in Eastern Europe were the primary contributors to this decline. In 2016, we expect this region to grow due to the addition of Airwaves, while the underlying business will see some headwinds in the first half as a result of the Norway integration completion, Eastern Europe weakness, and currency.","Asia Pac revenue declined 2% for the quarter, but grew 6% in constant currency. This region demonstrated signs of stabilization in the second half of 2015. We expect revenue to be approximately flat for 2016, due to difficult prior year compare and economic volatility in China. The Middle East region was down $2 million due to timing of systems integration of the major LTE business. We expect strong growth in 2016 similar to 2015, with ongoing LTE deployments.","Moving forward, the Middle East region will be incorporated into a new EMEA region. I will close with a few segment highlights. Our product segment continues to innovate, improve time-to-market and optimize cost. Our optimization and simplification results include successfully outsourcing our Penang manufacturing operations to San Mina and successfully reducing our SKU count at year-end by approximately 40%.","We launched new products and extended our technology leadership in Q4, including new devices, which are purpose-built for commercial customers in hazardous locations. Upgraded infrastructure software that improves the capability to sell software features and licensing applications, which will be an important source of growth moving forward.","In parallel, the services segment continues to demonstrate solid growth on a constant currency basis. In addition, our managed and support services business continues to win significant new business that is building multi-year backlog and recurring revenue streams.","Our primary services growth areas of managed and support services grew 7% in constant currency, which reflects growth in every region. We expect another year of solid growth in 2016. The Smart Public Safety business continues to grow with new wins and deployments led by our Emergency CallWorks suite of software and services. ","We extended our Public Safety LTE leadership with a country-wide Public Safety LTE win in the UK with an award value of $430 million, excluding any potential devices and we\u2019ve successfully demonstrated Public Safety LTE trials in several regions. And in Q1, we closed the acquisition of Airwave, which adds significant capabilities to our managed services business by providing a platform, people, systems and tools enabling the support of both LMR and LTE networks.","This transaction was funded with $675 million of additional debt as well as the use of foreign cash for the balance of the purchase price. And finally, the business is expected to continue to generate very attractive EBITDA and free cash flow for this foreseeable future.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Greg.","Greg Brown","Thanks, Gino. Let me close with a few thoughts. First, despite headwinds presented by a stronger dollar and areas of macroeconomic weakness, we delivered solid growth in several areas for the year, including North America, Asia-Pac and the Middle East, as well as our managed and support services business. Second, we plan on over 30% EPS growth this year.","We expect to build on our momentum in North America, add strategic capabilities to our services franchise with the addition of Airwave and continued to drive backlog with large state and nationwide deals. And at the same time, we plan on driving further operational efficiency with another $120 million in cost savings this year. Finally, I believe we are uniquely positioned to bridge the complimentary aspects of Public Safety LTE data with mission critical LMR voice. Our LMR market leading franchise remains rock solid as we continue to win major awards and build multi-year backlog in services, while at the same time, we won the four largest Public Safety LTE awards valued at over $800 million.","We continue to make the required investments in people and capabilities as we incorporate more services and software into our business that will enable us to deliver the right solutions at the right time for our customers. I feel confident that we're building a stronger and more competitive Company with durable earnings and cash generation that is well-positioned for the future.","And I'll now turn the call back over to Shep, before we open it up for your questions.","Shep Dunlap","Okay, thanks. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and a follow-up, so we can accommodate as many folks as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to proceed with a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. At this time, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is coming from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","George Notter","Hi guys. Thanks very much. I guess I have a whole slew of questions here. But I want to start with the guidance for Q1 \u2013 a touch below kind of what we were looking for \u2013 I think also just treat them a little unclear on how the street handled the Airwave numbers certainly but can you kind of walk through the step down we're seeing in Q1 is it just seasonality or are there other things kind of driving that.","And also I want to ask about Airwave. You're looking for $450 million in sales for 2016. I thought Airwave was running about $600 million a year and obviously we can adjust for the closing of the deal on February 19 but it sounds like you're still looking for little bit less on Airwave than we were thinking the run rate was previously. So those are my questions, thanks.","Greg Brown","So, George, let's take Q1 first. I think the way you think of the ingredients is it's consistent with what we signaled last earnings call. So in terms of the headwinds Latin America will be down about $40 million that\u2019s inclusive of iDEN for Q1, Europe we expect to be down approximately $40 million primarily driven by Norway as the largest contract we've ever had transitions off of the systems integration phase.","And the third one as we've articulated is FX of about $20 million based on the spot rates today. So think of about $100 million of headwind, the tailwind is $55 million of Airwave, which represents the stub period of closing last Friday on February 19. So that's how I would think about it. The $450 million of Airwave on an annual basis also represents a partial year. We haven\u2019t guided yet obviously and won\u2019t signal yet on the full year fiscal 2007 for top-line.","George Notter","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Simona Jankowski","Hi, thank you very much. I was wondering if you could quantify the EPS accretion you are expecting from Airwave this year. And then in terms of the longer-term trajectory for Airwave\u2019s revenues, how should we think about the UK Public Safety Network transitioning to the mobile operator there relative to Airwave\u2019s revenues in the UK?","Greg Brown","Hi, Simona. Well, first of all, I\u2019ll take the second one first. We're thrilled with the acquisition of Airwave both strategically and financially. As we talked about $450 million of revenue this year, I think probably the most important element is that as part of the negotiation. We've resolved all disputes and all contracts have been extended through the end of 2019. So when we now think about the predictability and financial visibility and commensurate earnings and cash as it relates to that acquisition, it\u2019s substantial and represents just under $2 billion in backlog through the extension of those contracts through the end of 2019.","We've worked very closely with the UK home office. They've been great in this engagement in working with us to successfully close the Airwave TETRA network where all contracts are extended through 2019. And also we are to your point, the beneficiaries of the ESN award of $430 million, which we view also we\u2019re well positioned to pursue. So we will work very closely with the home office customer as we transition and I think for a long time how complimentary networks co-exist. So we will drive the value creation through Airwave and also work closely with the customer on the rollout of ESN at some point in the future. On the EBITDA for 2016.","Gino Bonanotte","EBITDA \u2013 for EBITDA contribution of Airwave and I think Simona you, the question was specific to EPS contribution of Airwave in 2016. It's approximately $0.50.","Simona Jankowski","Thank you for that. And just to clarify, when you talked about the $2 billion backlog through 2019, is that inclusive of the $430 million for LTE or is that additional?","Greg Brown","No, that is not inclusive of the $430 million for LTE, the $1.95 is Airwave only.","Simona Jankowski","Okay, and then just past 2019, are there any tips for revenues that will remain in place at that point. Or is it going to switch over to your LTE maintenance?","Greg Brown","I think we\u2019ll work with the customer in the appropriate transition. And it\u2019s too early to make that call, but from an acquisition standpoint, we feel very good about our risk adjusted return of capital as it relates to the acquisition of Airwave.","Simona Jankowski","Thank you.","Greg Brown","Thank you, Simona.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Keith Housum","Great, thank you. Greg, as we look at ESN award from the UK. Is there any of that $430 million included in FY2016.","Greg Brown","No.","Keith Housum","Okay. Should we think about that being pushed out beyond FY2017 and how should we think about that award?","Greg Brown","I think from a financial planning standpoint, probably, yes, I would push it out past 2017. But again, we\u2019re going to work very diligently with the home office on the right optimization and mix. But from a planning standpoint, that\u2019s probably a prudent thing to do.","Keith Housum","Got you. And then changing gears over to the operating expense savings here in FY2016. You guys obviously did a great job here in 2015 taking expensive dollar system. What\u2019s your primary targets for taking out the $120 million here in 2016.","Greg Brown","Well, I'd let Gino add something but I would simply say that I think its representative. Those reductions are pretty consistent with the reductions we\u2019ve made to-date historically in terms of composition and mix. But as importantly Keith, the majority of the actions required to get to these cost targets for 2016 have already been taken. That\u2019s important to know.","Keith Housum","Great. Thank you.","Greg Brown","Thanks, Keith.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go ahead and take our next question from Ashwin Kesireddy with J P Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ashwin Kesireddy","Thanks for taking my question. As it relates to the core business, can you talk about your international full-year outlook? And I was really hoping if you could comment on whether your international outlook has gotten better or worse over the last few months, excluding Airwave?","Greg Brown","Well, I think if we go around the globe, North America which again is two-thirds of our business had a very strong 2015. And as they build backlog, we expect that growth to continue into 2016 at low-single digits. So we\u2019re very pleased with North America. Latin America is distressed. It\u2019s been consistently distressed from last year. I think it will probably decline at rates comparable to last year. I think it\u2019s worth noting that the majority of the decline in Latin America, which we expect to be down. We\u2019ll likely most \u2013 likely occur in the first half of this year. And then we would normalize through the balance of the year.","We expect EMEA to be up with Airwave. Without Airwave, it would be down primarily driven by the role of Norway. And Asia-Pac roughly we expect to be about flat. We\u2019ll grow in certain areas. We would expect given the nature of some of the macroeconomic items in China as well as some of the dynamics of the Chinese marketplace. We would expect to be down in China. So all in North America up low-single digits, Latin America down pretty markedly at levels in 2016 comparable to 2015, EMEA up with Airwave, down without Airwave primarily driven by Norway and Asia-Pac about flat with China declining.","Ashwin Kesireddy","Great, thank you. I just wanted to go back to the Airwave discussion. Can you give us a sense of the depreciation levels associated with the business and also tax rate probably they're running at a lower tax rate than your corporate average.","Greg Brown","Yes. Your first question was depreciation? Is that what it was depreciation\u2026","Ashwin Kesireddy","Yes.","Greg Brown","\u2026depreciation associated with Airwave?","Ashwin Kesireddy","Yes, that\u2019s right.","Greg Brown","So the depreciation associated with the Airwave deployment is approximately $80 million a year. And I'm sorry what was the second part of the question?","Ashwin Kesireddy","Tax rate.","Greg Brown","Tax rate associated with Airwave.","Gino Bonanotte","Yes. We\u2019ll follow-up Ashwin with tax rate. So Jack, if we could follow-up, we'll get you that information on the specific tax rate.","Ashwin Kesireddy","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ben Bollin","Thanks for taking my call, my question. I wanted to start, what was the absolute LTE contribution in 2015? Did you get to the $100 million figure? What's your expectation on where that is in 2016? And then I have a follow-up.","Greg Brown","Ben, we exceeded the number for 2015. It was about $130 million in 2015, a little higher than we had projected which we were pleased about in terms of 2016. And we look at kind of the unevenness and rollout of the four contracts we're implementing LA-RICS, two in the Middle East and ESN is the fourth award but again as we\u2019ve talked about earlier will have 2016 activity. We\u2019re thinking of 2016 PS LTE revenue contribution to be comparable to 2015 given that we were pleasantly surprised with the over performance in 2015.","Ben Bollin","Thanks. When you look at the FirstNet RFP, that's kind of been issued in their discussion around timing and their strategy with the statewide rollouts beyond the awards issued later this year. How are you feeling about your positioning within that? And then, when would you expect opportunities for bigger revenue contribution coming out of the North American Public Safety LTE on those awards?","Greg Brown","Well look, the idea of FirstNet around interoperable data in Public Safety we feel pretty good about the responses to the RFP are due back May 13, we\u2019ve had interest from a few different partners, we do plan on participating as you probably would expect in that response. We view LTE and Public Safety LTE in regards to the FirstNet as we\u2019ve said a number of times before to be additive to our LMR business and we continue to grow in North America.","We continue to add multi-year service contracts in North America. We continue to build backlog in North America with LMR. So, I think given our incumbency and our Public Safety expertise and our ability I think an ideal position to provide interoperability between LMR and over time Public Safety LTE in North America. I think we\u2019re very, very well positioned. We don\u2019t think of any revenue contribution in 2016 or 2017. And as FirstNet is talked about they are targeting an award by the end of the year may slip into really 2017, but that\u2019s kind of the composite attributes of the way we\u2019re thinking about FirstNet.","Ben Bollin","Thanks and one last one if I could get it. Given the guidance on top line and operating margins and kind of those cost cuts, what's actually built into your gross margin assumptions into 2016 that doesn't translate to even better flow through?","Greg Brown","Well, I think from a gross margin standpoint, as we incorporate Airwave everything blended together we think of the gross margin in the high 40s for 2016. That incorporate the shift to services a bit, incorporates obviously, the margin profile of Airwave. But having said that we expect to as we talked about grow EBITDA and grow EBITDA margins and grow operating cash and free cash flow as well in 2016.","Ben Bollin","Thank you.","Greg Brown","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude the Q&A portion of today\u2019s program. I will turn the floor back over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations for any additional or closing remarks.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks.

Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I'd like to make a few opening comments about the first quarter and the business overall before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. First, Q1 was a solid quarter for us. Revenue was flat, although when adjusting for currency, the business grew 3% with growth in all regions except Latin America. Additionally, we posted double-digit profitability growth with a 24% increase in non-GAAP operating earnings and a 36% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share.","Second, I'm very pleased with another excellent quarter of growth in North America, which grew 6% on strong product sales. Overall, our business continues to show signs of improvement, including our backlog position at the end of the quarter, which grew 8%.","And third, we continue to drive future growth through important investments in innovation, and we're driving an increasingly-efficient cost base that positions us well for improved leverage and stronger cash generation.","I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and our outlook.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. First quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, flat versus Q1 of 2014, up 3% in constant currency. Additionally, ending backlog was up $442 million or 8% versus last year, and up 1% versus Q4, inclusive of a $149 million unfavorable FX adjustment to backlog in Q1. GAAP operating earnings were $119 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $156 million or 12.8% of sales, a 250 basis point improvement from the year ago quarter. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.40 per share compared to $0.33 in the first quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP EPS grew 36% year-over-year primarily driven by our cost-savings initiatives. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.","Turning to the Product segment, Q1 sales were $758 million, up 1% versus the prior year and up 3% in constant-currency terms. Growth was driven by strong demand in North America for our P25 and PCR product lines. Q1 Product segment operating income was $90 million, up $38 million to 11.9% of sales versus the prior-year quarter, driven by our cost-reduction actions. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.2 billion, up $132 million versus last year and up $43 million sequentially, reflecting the fourth consecutive quarter of increase. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by Asia Pac and the Middle East, while we also saw an increase in North America. As expected, we saw a decrease in Europe related to the continuing deployment of the Norway system.","Turning to Services, Q1 Services revenue was $465 million, down 2% as expected. iDEN and integration services declined, while key growth areas of managed services and lifecycle support services were slightly up compared to last year. Excluding both iDEN and the impact of FX, our Services business grew 3%. Services operating income was $66 million, down $8 million to 14.2% of revenue, driven primarily by lower iDEN sales and a lower gross margin in integration services. As we stated in our Q4 call, we expect lower service gross margin in the first half of 2015. We continue to expect a return to the mid-30% gross margin range for the second half of the year. Services backlog is $4.6 billion, up $310 million or 7% versus last year, and flat sequentially despite a $145 million foreign exchange adjustment in Q1.","Moving to operating expenses, total company operating expenses from continuing operations were $396 million, down $60 million or 13% from the year ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost reduction activities, as well as some benefit due to pension expense and a stronger dollar. Our largest decline came in G&A, while we also drove reductions in sales and marketing and R&D. As of the end of Q1, we are on a run rate to deliver savings of $150 million to $ 175 million versus 2014. We are well positioned to deliver solid operating leverage as we move throughout the year.","Other income and expense in Q1 was $37 million compared to $18 million in the year ago quarter. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 29%. We continue to expect full year 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%. We also continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% through 2019.","Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $151 million, an increase of $139 million year-over-year. The improvement in cash generation was driven primarily by working capital improvements, specifically accounts receivable. We ended Q1 in a net debt position of $43 million. In Q1, we repurchased $653 million of stock at an average price of $66.12, while paying out $75 million in dividends.","Now, turning to our outlook. We expect total company sales for Q2 to decline 3% to 5%, which includes approximately $45 million in year-over-year currency impact. This outlook also includes approximately $20 million in headwinds in the second quarter related to the temporary delay of the LA-RICS Public Safety LTE deployment. We expect non-GAAP EPS between $0.51 and $0.56. Factoring in Q1 results, our first half expectations remain unchanged.","Moving to the full year, our revenue outlook remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year 2015 sales to be flat to down 2%, which translates to 1% to 3% growth in constant currency terms. We now expect full year non-GAAP EPS of $3.20 to $3.40 a share.","I'll now turn it back to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Gino. I'm encouraged by our Q1 results. North America was a particular bright spot which grew 6% on strong product sales. North America has posted two consecutive strong quarters of growth, and we believe the region will return to growth for the full year. Backlog is up in this region over $500 million on a year-over-year basis.","Moving to the other regions, the Europe and Africa region declined 11% in Q1 due to currency. Adjusting for currency, the region posted 1% growth. Asia Pac saw a 5% sales decline in Q1 or flat excluding currency. Order activity here has been healthy, and aged backlog in Asia Pac is higher than the second half of last year.","Our Middle East business, while smaller, is growing quickly, with a large rise in backlog, both year-over-year and sequentially, as the large Public Safety LTE win we mentioned last quarter added over $200 million to the backlog position.","Latin America had a challenging quarter due to a strong prior year compare, along with a significant decline in iDEN, as expected. Additionally, there's also a number of countries there that are facing difficult macroeconomic conditions, which is tempering our expectations in the region for the full year.","Turning to segment highlights and initiatives, in our Product segment, we're making progress across and against our growth initiatives of driving system upgrades, software enablement, monetizing product enhancements and new product introductions. In the quarter, we earned new business from customers upgrading aged systems, and purchasing additional software features and functionality. We also delivered more core innovation within our Product portfolio with a specific customer-driven solution such as the APX8000, a P25 portable radio featuring integrated Wi-Fi and quad band radio all in one device.","The Wi-Fi capability enables more efficient radio management for our customers, with a faster broadband connection for software feature and firmware updates. Additionally, this breakthrough technology enables four radio bands in one device, and allows our public safety customers to communicate across borders and between systems using a single device that further improves interoperability. From an R&D perspective, the APX8000 incorporates our newest platform development approach that will be fully leveraged on future models in order to minimize cost and drive simplification.","Another portfolio enhancement this quarter includes TETRA radio innovations specific to mission critical demands. Our new devices have improved ruggedness, coverage, audio and enhanced security features that better serve the specific needs of our public safety customers. In addition to new and improved device innovation, our North America P25 infrastructure now incorporates WAVE technology, which enables the convergence of LMR and LTE access from any device via an IP connection.","Our customers are responding to these growth drivers through strategic wins such as the Norway project utilizing WAVE technology to enable secure approved users, the ability to monitor and utilize specific talk groups while outside the country or network; the $135 million South Australia network that's a major upgrade of an existing system with new features and functionality; the $46 million win with Hamilton County, Ohio that's an upgrade of their existing system with integrated voice and data capabilities that not only improves their network today, but enables continuous upgrades to new features and functionality via software updates going forward.","Our Services segment revenue was down slightly this quarter due to currency pressure, iDEN and integration services declines. However, we posted increases in the areas of lifecycle support services, managed services and Smart Public Safety solutions. Lifecycle wins include a $32 million award with Hamilton County, Ohio for a multi-year hardware and software maintenance agreement on top of the $14 million hardware and system upgrade. It also includes a multi-year hardware and software agreement with the City of Columbus, Georgia for $7.2 million, plus $5.8 million for a multiyear PremierOne CAD maintenance agreement. Both of these support agreements are on top off a $6 million order for conventional equipment.","Our managed services business earned several notable wins, including $62 million for a multiyear managed services contract that was a part of the South Australia Government Radio Network deal, and we also won multiyear managed services deals worth $9 million in Brazil and $8 million in Iraq. Finally, our Smart Public Safety Solutions business was bolstered with the acquisitions of Emergency CallWorks and PublicEngines. Both companies are leading providers of software-based solutions, solidifying our offerings in command and control, and next generation 9-1-1 call centers and intelligence-led policing solutions.","Key wins include a $6 million command and control contract with a country in Africa, $3 million to expand the city of Chicago's video surveillance system, and several CAD and next-generation 9-1-1 wins, leveraging our new Emergency CallWorks portfolio.","So let me close with a few thoughts. First, Q1 was a solid start to the year in terms of sales momentum and ending backlog position. We performed particularly well in both North America and the Middle East. Second, we continue to make excellent progress driving further operational efficiencies, while also improving speed and execution. We feel confident about delivering on our cost targets and will keep applying the proper rigor to size the business appropriately for the long term. And finally, we continue to aggressively return capital to shareholders. We bought back $653 million of stock and paid $75 million of dividends in Q1. We've returned over $2 billion to shareholders just in the past two quarters alone, and we've now moved into a net debt position. And that said, we remain focused on further improving the efficiency of our balance sheet.","And I'll now turn it back over to Shep.","Shep Dunlap - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I would like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and a follow-up so we can accommodate as many people as possible.","Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we can take our first question from Tim Long with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.","Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Two questions for me. First, on the revenue side, obviously, backlog looks strong two quarters in a row here even, ex-ing out the currency. It looks like the second half implies pretty flat year-over-year. So just wondering why that's not a little bit stronger. Is there something in the aging of the backlog or something that maybe makes us feel better about heading into next year? And then secondly, on the gross margin side, I get in the quarter that services was a little bit of a drag. Just curious on the Product side, that was down a little bit as well. Just curious, are there any measures you can take to match the strong performance you're having on the OpEx side and maybe get some more efficiencies out of the gross margin line on Products? Thank you.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Tim. This is Gino. I'll start with the gross margin question specifically in Product. The impact of currency is really what we're seeing from a Product gross margin perspective. It's about 50 basis points on gross margin. Actually, it's a bit larger than that, offset by strong North America Product sales. And we continue to explore and work different options to minimize, certainly, the impact of FX, as we've done in OpEx. With respect to the backlog position, nothing's really changed in the aging. It is a little bit different expectation of the in-year orders versus backlog orders for the remainder of the year, but there is no change in aging \u2013 any appreciable change in the aging of backlog.","Tim Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ehud Gelblum with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Very strong, stable results. A couple questions. First of all, at what point do you expect to lap Norway? And x-Norway, is Europe stable or still declining? And is it \u2013 once we get past \u2013 I assume by the end of this year, we'll certainly be past the initial decline in Norway, does Europe start growing? And then one of your competitors, Harris, obviously is having some issues. A lot of that is share gains by you guys. I'm assuming most of that is North America. Is there any way you can parse out how much of the strength you see in North America is share gains from Harris versus how much is underlying market growth? And then lastly, a comment on LTE. Obviously, LTE has had a rough quarter, both at LA-RICS and at FirstNet. What are your thoughts?","We saw the guidance, the $20 million in headwinds from LA in Q2, but what are your thoughts on the $100 million for this year and for next year? And just kind of just walk us through the \u2013 your long-term thoughts on LTE. What are the different directions that can go in, both kind of in a normal bull case but also in a bear case? What could happen if LTE and FirstNet really doesn't get off the ground? What does that scenario look like for the next couple of years then for your business? Thanks.","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Hudy, a couple of things. Let's start with \u2013 I'll start with Harris. Yes, I think clearly that the 4% growth in Q4 led by Jack Molloy and his team, as well as the 6% in Q1, really strong performance. Now, we don't expect North America to grow for the full year at those levels. But that said, there's no question we are taking market share from them. I don't know the exact bifurcation of share gain versus overall market lift. What I would say is though, as per my previous comments, I thought that narrow banding would largely be behind us by the first half of this year. I would say that, that's still true given not only the North America growth performance, but the device performance specifically within North America. That's first.","Second, LTE. Despite the LA-RICS delay and the $20 million headwind in Q2 and the down scoping of that project for the full year, I remind you that we have three projects, large ones, that generate probably 90% plus of the LTE revenue. Even with the headwinds in LA, and we're pleased that, that suspension's been lifted, we're looking forward to completing a successful system. We still believe, Hudy, we can do approximately $100 million in Public Safety LTE revenue this year because there's other puts and takes from the other projects. And in the main, we still feel pretty good about the full year and our earlier projections.","Last in terms of LTE, we're focused on completing the awards that have been made, as we mentioned at the financial analyst meeting. We're still engaged with some customers in the Middle East, customers in Latin America, customers in Asia Pac. And we will continue to pace here in the U.S. to the pace of FirstNet. The draft RFP is out. It's still unclear what final configuration or business model will result in FirstNet, but we continue to work closely with them, and we'd certainly have a number of options that we're planning for, contingent upon how ultimately, Public Safety LTE gets rolled out in the U.S. So I think we're well prepared from a variety of different options standpoint, and we're still in a good position. And by the way, with the investments we made, we have the best portfolio, and I believe at least a two-year head start versus our competitors.","Mark Moon - Executive Vice President & President-Sales and Product Operations","Just to tag on to that, and then I'll speak to your question about Norway, Hudy. The other thing to point out on those three large deployments that Greg mentioned, quite honestly, even the smaller trials that we've got going, they're primarily infrastructure today. So when you think about future growth, you also got to think about they're clearly going to add devices, applications, additional services. So that's also why it was important for LA-RICS, although descoped, to get back started so that we can demonstrate the capabilities, and that will lead to some future growth of those kinds of items as we move forward.","On Norway, clearly, the biggest burn-off, if you will, of the Norway revenue will happen in the second half, as we indicated earlier, then we'll see more of a reasonable trend. Obviously, that will put pressure on EA even for next year because we've had a strong first half in Norway this year. With that being said, though, just like this first quarter, we had growth in constant currency terms. So EA still continues to perform strong. We are eating out of backlog as we expected to be, but really because of Norway. We're still working on a number of large deals. Our funnel and customer activity is still pretty healthy. So I do see, as we go into 2016 and beyond, we will backfill behind Norway and begin to move back towards growth.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful. I appreciate that. Thanks","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Hudy.","Shep Dunlap - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question.","Operator","And our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Thank you very much for taking my question. I'd actually like to talk a bit more about LTE because I get the feeling there has been a bit of confusion, especially in the last 24 hours, in the investment community about how LTE spending and the ramp-up of LTE could affect LMR spending on \u2013 in your client base. So I think it would be very useful to have your perspective on how LTE gets integrated with LMR, and if there is a risk of LTE, at some point, replacing LMR infrastructure, and if a ramp-up in spending in LTE could hurt spending in LMR. So your perspective on that point would be very, very helpful, I think.","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Pierre, we \u2013 just to be clear, we absolutely view Public Safety LTE as additive, not substitutional to LMR, first and foremost. Our view is unchanged from that perspective. I mean, I can only tell you what customers are telling us and what they're doing, both domestically and internationally. And they continue to buy LMR. By the way, North America being a great example, referenced 4% in Q4, 6% in Q1. The Middle East is another good example. And in the three large projects of Public Safety LTE, they are all either have bought or are in the process of buying brand new LMR systems with multiyear services contract as well. So, look, I know there's a lot of noise about this, but at the end of the day, I feel very good about our position and investments in technology, and specifically, Pierre, mission critical voice and mission critical data communications.","Customers are buying both LMR and Public Safety LTE. Backlog are at the highest levels I can remember. And remember, that includes multiyear services showing the staying power and longevity of our solutions and our platforms. So I know there's a lot of noise and misinformation, I just don't see it. I see LMR and our core platforms having a long installed life. And I see Public Safety LTE as being additive and eventually interoperable, so you have broadband data interoperable with narrow band voice. Many countries in Europe continue to buy country-wide TETRA systems. Some of those are also looking at LTE solutions.","So I look at it as an overlay. And when you look at the work done in the standards community, and people use labels like mission critical, but there's mission critical voice and then there's mission critical voice for public safety. And you get into a whole host of different attributes in the first layer of the 3GPP standards, the second layer of the 3GPP standards, and then the actual network deployment components that are necessary for power generation and redundancy, and the device-device communications in case the site goes down. I think it's a space we know well, and I think we know both LMR and LTE well. We absolutely view them as additive, and we view them as contributing to a very solid growth story for us going forward.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. That's very useful clarification. And I think it's a very important message to clarify, as you say, the noise we heard recently on that. Thanks for that.","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Pierre.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for the question, and good earnings. So I wanted to dig a little bit more into the Services line, well, I guess from a couple of angles, but it's really the same question, which is you guys are talking about the gross margin improving in the second half. I assume that, that's because the mix of installation services is reducing. But I just wanted to ask you guys if you could give us any indication what the proportion of maintenance services \u2013 or I'm sorry, of installation services in the current Services line is, so we can kind of think about how that gross margin might progress. And then the same thing from a different angle. I'm looking at your backlog, and the last two quarters, this big jump in Services backlog. I wonder, do you expect that backlog in Services to wind down in the second half? Or can you just talk about how that backlog is built up and how you expect it to move in the second half of the year? Thanks.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Rod. This is Gino. We'll start with Services. So the \u2013 as we talked about in the last call, Services gross margin, we expect to be pressured in the first half, returning to normal growth rates in the second half. And it's really a mix within integration services, not to integration services, the projects that are deploying in the first half of the year. And the question on how much of our Services number is integration services, about 40%, 45%.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And, Gino, do you expect \u2013 what do you think that proportion will be in the second half?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think the proportion will be very similar. It will be within that 40% to 45% range. Again, it's the mix within integration services, not to integration services.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then on the backlog for the Services backlog, what do you think that is going to look like as we move to the second half of the year?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We don't outlook backlog, but I will say that the backlog, Services backlog does include a large number of multi-year service agreements. So I would not expect that backlog to be peeling off in the second half of the year substantially.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Do you think \u2013 or should we expect the growth to continue or do you think it more or less kind of remains stable through the year?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm not going to comment on outlooking that backlog, but I will say there \u2013 you should not expect any major movement in the Services backlog down in the second half of the year.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And just, Rod, one other just question about overall backlog. From an aging standpoint, total backlog, now this is both Product and Services, it's slightly better than last year. It's about $50 million at this point better than last year for aged backlog for the remainder of 2015 all in.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Gino, a couple of quick guidance questions to dig into gross margin again. Last year, I think gross margin kind of ticked up sequentially each quarter pretty steadily. Is that the pattern you would expect from just a lower base in Q1, or is there kind of a specific quarter that there would be a bigger uplift? And then on operating cost, can you kind of repeat what the OpEx guidance is for the year? Is it $150 million to $175 million decline non-GAAP versus non-GAAP 2014, or I think there was a mention of a run rate number? I just want to make sure I was clear on what that OpEx guidance was.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So I'll start with the gross margin question, Tavis. Gross margin, it's really first half to second half, although we do expect to see a slight improvement in the second quarter over the first quarter. But it's largely a first half to second half improvement. With respect to operating expenses, the guidance is down $150 million to $175 million versus 2014 full year. The run rate comment was meant to articulate that we are currently at the run rate. Exiting Q1, we are on that run rate to deliver savings of $150 million to $175 million.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. And then kind of a bigger picture question for you, Greg, you made an acquisition or two in the quarter, some venture capital investments. And I guess give us a sense of how broad you would like the solution set over the next couple of years and how you get there from kind of primarily a radio business to something that might be kind of a fuller solution set selling into your core customers.","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that from an acquisition standpoint, they \u2013 the general philosophy would be that they would be in line with the core business of what we do. Primarily, I think as you dimensionalized where we are today as a pure play, I think potentially things around the managed services area or the Smart Public Safety area might afford themselves to round out our portfolio, because we're building the end-to-end infrastructure and device solution. We have it on narrow band LMR. We also have it on a broadband Public Safety LTE. So things that would extend from a situational awareness standpoint to potentially the command and control room, and analytics that would allow the movement of content around software and services. So in general, from a macro standpoint, I'd say software and managed services would seem to be appealing to us. We feel very good about the core radio position and the enhancement of the technology portfolio on that side. But we'll continue to be very surgical in what we do.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And when we hear about a lot of demand for body cameras right now, is that something that you guys benefit from at all from a retail relationship, or is that generally a different purchase order from the purchase monitors?","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So we do have a product around body cameras that we're in the market with today. I think that the whole push on situational awareness and the heightened awareness around video is a net positive beyond body cameras, by the way. I think there's other ways that we would be able to and could potentially capture video aside from just an auxiliary camera. But I think we believe the real value there is in the processing of video, the dissemination and aggregation of it, the analytics of it, the sharing of it. Because it's a ton of information that's going to be piling into these command centers, and with first responders at the site, how do you move it between the two? How do you extract it? How do you provide decision support? How do you do evidence tagging? So I think we're burning more cycles. We have hardware solutions and we'll continue to do that, but we think the real value of body worn video or this preponderance and importance of video is in the software movement and analytics of it.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Thanks very much. I wanted to follow up on your comment on the North America improvement. Can you just expand a little bit on the visibility you have into that, in particular your aged backlog for this year as it pertains to that? And then I think you referenced the mix of devices versus the infrastructure in the quarter. Can you just comment on how that compares to what you've seen in recent quarters?","Mark Moon - Executive Vice President & President-Sales and Product Operations","So, Simona, this is Mark Moon. So when we think about North America, Greg talked about we were pleased with Q4 and Q1. By the way, coming out of that, our backlog position is better. A big piece of that backlog position improvement is in multi-year services, which is also good for future upgrades in what we do, but our Product backlog is also up, and the backlog aged in the year is actually stronger than it was at this point last year. So we're seeing the improvement that we thought we would see in North America. When you look at North America in general, overall, state and local spend and revenues are up. IT spend is up. Federal seems to be returning to a little bit more normal predictability for us. We were up slightly last year. As I talked to you about in the last call, while we were down slightly in first quarter, we still have got some good orders and we're building backlog, and we think we'll have modest growth for the full year. So we have good visibility, good activity throughout North America. I mean, we are encouraged by the activity we're seeing from customers in North America.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And on the mix of devices and infrastructure?","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think in Q1, the growth primarily was device-driven, which I think reflects our commentary around narrow banding as purchasing kind of returns to more normalized states.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, for an update on the capital structure, do you see any additional capacity now to add debt from here?","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, from a capital structure standpoint, what I'd say is obviously, we've been very aggressive in returning capital. We've returned $3.1 billion over the last 11 months. Almost all of the proceeds from the Zebra transaction have been returned to shareholders. We did $2.1 billion just in the last two quarters. I like the fact that the share base has contracted 39% in just over three years. So I think we've been good stewards of capital, and we purchased $650 million back at $66-and-change. At today's levels, we absolutely see the stock is even more attractive today. So I think there'll be opportunities for us to pursue that moving forward. And we're in a net debt position, and we said we would move to that position. We're pleased that coming out of Q1, we're in it. So I think our balance sheet has a lot of flexibility that affords us options moving forward.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. Please go head.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Fahad (38:19) in for Paul. I had a couple of questions. One, on your OpEx for the year, are there any benefits from the FX headwinds that you've indicated on your revenue line? Is the OpEx side being driven positively by the FX?","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So we did \u2013 just to remind you, we did $200 million \u2013 over $200 million of expense reduction last year, and we're run rating to $150 million to $175 million this year. While we clearly have a benefit from FX, the overwhelming majority of those reductions are non-FX. I'd say 75% roughly are reductions, 25% is being the beneficiary of FX. We're getting after the cost, and with the opportunity as a pure play company, we're restructuring, reconfiguring, eliminating bureaucracies and redundancies, and duplications and footprint, and I'm really proud of the team and we'll continue to move forward on that.","Unknown Speaker","All right. And then secondly, regarding this St. Louis Police Department win, it seems you indicated Real-Time Intelligence solution that you sold, can you elaborate more on these next-gen growth driver businesses that you're involved in? How does that pipeline for those kind of projects look for you?","Bob Schassler - Executive Vice President-Solutions & Services","Yeah, this is Bob Schassler. We implemented our Real Time Crime Center in St. Louis, which, as we've talked about in the past, it's about a $5 billion SAM for us, and we've got probably about 12 new deals that we've actually signed in the first quarter. And the reception by customers really continues to be positive. As Greg talked a little bit about, the video analytics, body worn cameras is really part of that overall solution.","Unknown Speaker","So in terms of, like, sales from video analytics, and if I'm not mistaken, you also provide some storage solutions as well? Or is that...","Bob Schassler - Executive Vice President-Solutions & Services","That's right. It's really our overall Smart Public Safety solutions, so storage, video analytics, our PublicEngines acquisition is part of that, data analytics as well.","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's fair to say, obviously, that's relatively small today. What's important, though, is customers, many would like to do business with one provider. So while there's a variety of different products, to the extent we, if we have the land mobile radio system and we can extend the relationship, the sales resources, the technical people into the command center, and do in hardware and\/or software and potentially storage, it's a logical extension of what we do that I think generally will help our growth profile.","Bob Schassler - Executive Vice President-Solutions & Services","The only other comment I'd have is that these are really software-based solutions recurring revenue models, so they go on for five years to ten years, and it's really part of our overall Public Safety LTE solution combined with our Smart Public Safety Solutions, as we've said, are very complementary to one another.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Dominic Ruccella - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. This is Dominic sitting in for Keith. Noticing on the \u2013 given Q2 guidance and what was reported in Q1, did you guys see any business shifts from the second quarter, happen to come in a little earlier for you guys and impact your first quarter?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, the...","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. First half is unchanged to our prior expectations. Q1 performed a little bit better, but the first half remains unchanged.","Dominic Ruccella - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. All right. And then are you guys seeing any impact on demand from FX coming from internationally?","Mark Moon - Executive Vice President & President-Sales and Product Operations","This is Mark, Dominic. We really are not. I mean, so far as we look at the piece, we've made some slight price adjustments in certain places. But in general, we're not seeing any competitive disadvantages. Certainly, the economic pressures in Latin America are putting tension on price power for them to purchase. But as far as competitive pressures on pricing, we're not really seeing any.","Dominic Ruccella - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. All right. That's it for me. Thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dominic.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Genovese with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.","Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC","Yeah, thank you very much. You guys recently published an SEC document where you had some language in there about a long-term potential shift from Products to Services, and therefore, lower gross margins over time. So we saw some evidence of that in this quarter, but you're not talking about it on the call as a long-term trend. So how much should we be thinking about that as a long-term trend versus just adding another risk factor and covering your bases in an SEC document?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I mean, we \u2013 it's indicative of the backlog position we're in. We've signed multiple multi-year agreements and Services backlog has been growing, so the comment just indicated that there will be a movement to Services. It'll make up more of our revenue, and the Services margin, although operating margin is very, very similar, Services margin is a little bit lower than our Product margin. That was the entire comment.","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, we think this is a good thing. It's a favorable trend. Having a higher mix of multi-year services is good. Having annuity based revenue is good. Having a long-term relationship with the customer is good because we still, irrespective of the mix, which I think is what we just are formally acknowledging over time as a future trend, we think that's a very positive thing to enable and further cement the relationships we have with our customers domestically and internationally. Having said all that, we still think that we can, with a lower cost structure, improve operating leverage, and from an operating margin standpoint, maintain or increase the operating margins and cash generation that's associated with the profile of the business in aggregate.","Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC","So just to follow up there, so you're not saying that there's a fundamental outlook change in the Product business, the expectations there are on track with your previous expectations, or is there a change in the Product outlook? I'm just a little bit unclear on that point.","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. Just to clarify, as Gino said, Product margins are generally comparable. We expect them to remain comparable for the balance of the year. Gross margin pressures, Services-oriented, as expected, in Q1 and Q2, i.e., first half, i.e., largely driven by Norway and some large products. We expect the Services gross margin to increase in the second half and generally normalize in the mid 30s%.","Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks very much.","Mark Moon - Executive Vice President & President-Sales and Product Operations","And then I think just to tag on just one quick second, what we have said, and Greg just said, is product profile really unchanged, but we expect our Services business to grow faster than our Product business in general. And so that would lead to this longer term trend. It's not necessarily something you're going to see in the next two quarters, three quarters or four quarters, but over time, that would be the case.","Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. I appreciate the explanation. Thanks.","Gregory Q. Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","It appears we have no further questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks.","Shep Dunlap - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks. As mentioned at the outset, we made a number of forward-looking statements during the call. This includes outlooks on sales, gross margins, EPS, OpEx, EBITDA, other income expense and operating cash flow, as well as effective \u2013 and cash tax rates, the impact of currency, Public Safety LTE and LMR, regional growth, acquisitions, capital return and buybacks, as well as backlog.","Thanks for joining us, and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

Mr. Kutsor, you may begin your conference.","Chris Kutsor - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, and good afternoon. Welcome to our 2018 second quarter earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President and CFO; Bruce Brda, Executive Vice President, Products & Solutions; and Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales & Services. Greg and Gino will review our results along with commentary, and Bruce and Jack will join for Q&A.","We've posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com\/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. During the call, we reference non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted.","A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation and during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in today's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I'll now turn it over to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook.","First, Q2 was another outstanding quarter of revenue growth and cash generation. We grew 18% with organic growth of 6%, led by another very strong performance in the Americas. Additionally, we generated $425 million of operating cash during the quarter.","Second, our outlook. We're raising both, revenue and EPS guidance for the full year, including $40 million of unfavorable currency impact since our last update. And finally, we ended the quarter with backlog of $9.4 billion, up 11% from last year, which is our highest backlog ever posted at the end of a second quarter. This strong backlog position coupled with our Avigilon acquisition provides excellent momentum for the remainder of 2018 and beyond.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Gino to provide additional operational details on Q2 results and outlook before returning for a few \u2013 some closing thoughts.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Greg. First, let me briefly cover the change in our segment reporting. The new segments are Products and Systems Integration, and Services and Software. The change consists of moving Systems Integration from our former Services segment into the newly presented Products and Systems Integration segment and moving Software from our former Products segment into the new Services and Software segment.","Services and Software is comprised primarily of recurring revenue. This includes Managed & Support Services, public safety and enterprise command center software, video softwares and unified communications applications such as our Kodiak and WAVE solutions. A reconciliation of the reporting segment changes can be found in the 8-K filing.","Moving to results. Q2 revenue was $1.8 billion, up 18% from last year, including $154 million of revenue from acquisitions and $24 million of revenue related to the adoption of accounting standard ASC 606. Organic revenue, which excludes acquisitions and the accounting changes, was up 6%, including $26 million of favorable FX. Organic revenue in constant currency was up 4%. GAAP operating earnings were $273 million, up $12 million from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $378 million, up $62 million or 20% from the year ago quarter. And operating margin was 21.5% of sales, up 40 basis points from last year.","GAAP earnings per share were $1.05, up 35% from $0.78 last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.46, up 30% from $1.12 last year. Ending backlog was $9.4 billion, up $919 million from last year. Products and Systems Integration backlog was up $367 million or 13%, and Services and Software backlog was up $552 million or 10%. Q2 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1.2 billion, up $142 million or 14%, including $115 million from acquisitions and ASC 606. Avigilon and LMR growth in the Americas drove the increase.","Q2 Products and Systems Integration segment operating income was $226 million or 19% of sales, down 50 basis points from last year on higher OpEx related to acquisitions, partially offset by higher gross margins. Products and Systems Integration segment backlog ended the quarter at $3.1 billion, up $367 million or 13% from last year, driven by the Americas and EMEA. Sequentially, Products and SI backlog was up $5 million, inclusive of approximately $20 million of unfavorable currency adjustments.","Turning to Services and Software. Q2 Services and Software revenue was $571 million, up $121 million or 27% from last year with growth in every region. This includes $57 million from acquisitions. Services and Software operating income was $152 million or 26.6% of sales, up 170 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and gross margin, partially offset by higher OpEx related to the acquisitions and our organic R&D investments in the software platform.","We expect margins to improve in 2019 and beyond in both Services and Software. Services and Software backlog ended at $6.3 billion, up $552 million or 10% from last year, driven by the Americas and Asia Pac. Sequentially, Services and Software backlog is down approximately 3% or $200 million, which includes a $170 million unfavorable FX adjustment and $138 million of Airwave revenue recognition.","Total OpEx in Q2 was $463 million, up $85 million from the year ago quarter, driven by acquisitions and ASC 606. For the full year, we continue to expect OpEx of approximately $1.8 billion versus $1.5 billion last year, driven by OpEx related to acquisitions and the adoption of ASC 606. Other income and expense was $44 million, compared to $39 million in the year ago quarter. Net interest expense was $58 million, compared to $51 million a year ago. And the Q2 effective tax rate was 25%.","Turning to cash flow, Q2 operating cash flow was $425 million, up from $173 million last year. The increase is a result of improved working capital and higher earnings. Free cash flow was $384 million. Capital expenditures were lower by $12 million compared with last year as a result of lower IT spend related to the ERP implementation completed last year. Normalized for pension, we expect approximately $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year.","During Q2, we repaid $100 million of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility ahead of schedule. This leaves an outstanding balance of $300 million, which we expect to repay by the end of the year. Additionally, during the second quarter, we used $40 million to pay off and close the revolver assumed in the Avigilon acquisition and we paid dividends of $84 million.","Turning to outlook. We expect Q3 sales to be up approximately 13% with EPS between $1.67 and $1.72 based on 173 million fully diluted shares. For the full year, we are raising our revenue and EPS guidance, including $40 million in unfavorable currency impact since our last guidance.","We now expect revenue growth of approximately 14.5%, up from approximately 14%. And we now expect EPS in the range of $6.79 to $6.89, up from our prior guidance of $6.70 to $6.85. This full year outlook assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 25%.","Looking at regional results, Americas revenue was up 21%, inclusive of $115 million from acquisitions. The Americas' growth was driven by strong demand for LMR products and services, as well as video surveillance. Q2 backlog is up approximately $800 million year-over-year.","EMEA revenue was up 15% across both segments, driven primarily by acquisitions and FX. Backlog was up in Products and Systems Integration and down in Services and Software, driven by FX and Airwave revenue recognition. In Asia Pac, revenue was up 4%, driven primarily by favorable FX rates. Backlog was up approximately $200 million compared to last year.","Finally, I'd like to end with some notable highlights. In our Products and Systems Integration segment, we were awarded a $71 million P25 system upgrade in Northern Africa; a $35 million P25 expansion for the New South Wales Telco Authority in Australia; a $15 million P25 system replacement for Flagler County, Florida; and a $495 million five-year IDIQ contract with the U.S. Army to provide P25 devices, accessories and services.","In our Services and Software segment, we were awarded a $50 million multi-year support agreement for a large county-wide system in the U.S.; a $41 million command center upgrade in Asia, including a 10-year services agreement; and a $16 million multi-year managed services renewal in Chile. These awards are additional proof points of the long-term critical value that our LMR platform provides customers around the world.","I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Gino. Let me close with a few final thoughts. First, our Q2 results were outstanding. The 6% organic growth and record Q2 ending backlog were driven by the continued demand for our LMR platforms, which now total approximately 13,000 systems worldwide. Second, the Avigilon acquisition is exceeding our expectations with Q2 growth in the high-teens and is supported by a growing addressable market that's now approximately $12 billion, excluding China. Additionally, I'm encouraged by our progress in bringing Avigilon into new routes to market with our government direct sales team and our existing MSI channel partners, many of which historically sold competitive video products.","And finally, our Services and Software segment has been an area of significant focus. We've expanded our services installed base and we're building the only end-to-end public safety command center platform in the industry. I expect Services and Software to continue to grow at a faster rate than Products and Systems Integration. The Services and Software segment is now basically \u2013 it's effectively a proxy for recurring revenue going forward. And finally, I expect to drive meaningful operating margin expansion in this segment in 2019 and beyond.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris.","Chris Kutsor - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up, so we get to as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Our first question is coming from Walter Piecyk of BTIG.","Walter Piecyk - BTIG LLC","Thanks. Two questions. Just can you size the Hytera band in terms of, if they can't sell in the market, what you think that provides in terms of incremental revenue? And then also \u2013 well, hold on. Excuse me, and then also could you talk about any opportunities that are out there to buy new service businesses that are out there in terms of driving incremental recurring revenue? Thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, Walter, how are you doing? As it relates to Hytera, first of all, we're very pleased with the progress on Hytera. We won a court ruling in the ITC in July and we recently won a ruling in Germany and Mannheim federal court for patent infringement. As you probably know, just a few weeks ago, less than 10 days ago, we filed an additional copyright infringement lawsuit, which basically is effectively than copying source codes. So, we will hold them accountable. We will do whatever we need to do to protect our IP and we feel very good about the progress we're making.","We haven't sized, to your specific question, the potential upside. It's worth noting there's nothing in 2018 that's been modeled as potential upside and ultimately what's decided. We also have a pending lawsuit in D\u00fcsseldorf, where our General Counsel, Mark Hacker, is there now. And we have a lawsuit against them in Australia. What I will say is our PCR business, which is where we compete with them head to head, is growing robustly. I think Molloy's team domestically and internationally continue to take ground and maybe that's a byproduct of that. I don't know but that's my view on Hytera.","In terms of acquisitions, we'll continue to keep an eye out on the services' side and the video side. You've probably heard me refer to we're always looking for \"many Airwaves\". There might be one or two that materialize this year, hard to say, but we're always looking given our scale economies and what we've done under Kelly Mark to see if we can add more for expanded earnings and operating margin. So, we'll continue to evaluate accordingly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath of Deutsche Bank.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Hey, good afternoon. Yeah, hi, Greg, Gino. Two questions quickly. One would be on constant currency organic growth rate, if you could comment on that for this year? And then a quick follow on would be Avigilon, the strategic asset, Gino, any update on that in terms of how is it ramping here in the U.S. market? Thanks.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, Vijay. On organic growth constant currency, our view remains unchanged for the full year. We've talked about it being about 4% for the full year. Actually, given where we are through the strong first half and our guidance contemplated in the second half, it's probably slightly higher than that on an annual basis for organic growth constant currency. So, we feel pretty good with that. And that's in the face of growing backlog, so I think that that combination is a good one.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. And a quick Avigilon update?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. I mean I'll let Jack \u2013 Avigilon is going ahead of our business plan, internally ahead of our expectations. I think Jack and team have done a very good job. It's all about getting them new routes to market. They have a world-class product, 800 plus patents, a great patent portfolio. And the combination gives them exposure to state and local public safety, expanded commercial markets. The federal business, which I think could be quite substantial, probably our largest opportunity at least in the near term. And I think it's going well.","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, Greg. I think the only thing I'd follow on to that is the thing, Vijay, we've been most impressed with their speed of product deliverables. I mean they came out with anomaly detection here in the last 60 days. There's more to follow, so good news there. And I think as Greg said, our fundamental role is to bring them scale, to bring them coverage not only in North America as Greg said with the federal, state, and local business, but as we look to our international distribution partners, our international sales teams in places like the UK, bring them incremental scale in terms of routes to market. And that's really been the full focus here in the last 90 days.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Two questions if I could. First, just on the backlog and revenue visibility. Greg, obviously, it's up a good bit. We are looking at a little bit lower year-over-year growth rate next quarter than what we've seen. And so, is there anything in there about kind of timing or, Gino, of that backlog of note, and just maybe if you could just talk a little bit about kind of that visibility into the second half and into the next year?","And then just on the follow-up on the margin front, it sounds like you're expecting a good margin move in the Software and Services business. Could you talk a little bit about what you're expecting or any opportunities on the Products and Systems Integration side? Thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. Tim, first of all, on Q3 guidance, it's very important to note that the majority of the unfavorable FX is in Q3, number one. Number two, most importantly, the U.S. Federal close falls in Q4 this year, not Q3. So, I think a better way that's more informative to look at the firm is the second half and the first half and not Q3 specifically given the federal close is going to fall in Q4 for us.","On Services and Software, as Gino and I have already mentioned, I think that there's a meaningful operating margin improvement in 2019 and beyond. I think \u2013 we're looking for something more like 30% operating margins or close to 30% operating margins for 2019. And I don't think there's any reason to stop there on that segment. And on the Products' side, we'll continually work on that front too.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","And Tim, we certainly expect comparable gross margins in 2018 versus the prior year, and we expect that to continue.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hey, Greg and Gino. If you've already addressed this, I apologize. I'm juggling calls tonight. But first off, Gino, the statement you just made about gross margin. You all previously referenced that you've turned your focus or turning your focus to gross margin and driving uplifts and what you've done with driving down your OpEx revenue and that you've had multiple levers there.","So my question to you is relative to your \u2013 the statement you just made, what is the opportunity both from a timing magnitude standpoint and the qualitative drivers? And then if you're \u2013 again if you've already said it, I apologize, but I was hoping you could give an update on UK Airwave and ESN?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. On the first one, I mentioned focusing on Services and Software driving towards significant operating margin expansion, kind of, as a marker for 2019 getting closer to 30% operating margins. I think to your point, Paul, that will come out of a combination of AGM, above gross margin, and OpEx. But our belief is that the opportunity, probably in that segment, is more on the gross margin side.","As it relates to Airwave, we continue to make, I think, good progress. We still anticipate agreement by the end of the quarter. I think it's worth noting that we're now negotiating both Airwave and ESN agreements in tandem. And while term and conditions are still fluid, our view and my view is unchanged. I think Airwave will stay \u2013 be in place many, many years beyond 2020. And ESN is now looking to be more like a standards-based Kodiak solution.","And I think both those developments are good for us. And I think at the end of the day, the UK Home Office solution between those two will look more and more like FirstNet here in the States. I think at the end of the day there's a few ingredients in the blender if you will that we'll take under consideration, there's political, there's practical, there's financial, and we'll evaluate all of those with the customer to make sure that we ensure the best agreement for our company.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC","Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Notter of Jefferies.","Kyle McNealy - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. This is Kyle on for George. A quick one on Avigilon, you mentioned previously that Avigilon was mostly product in your previous segment categories. Now that you're pulling software out of that and I guess Avigilon might have had some integration as well, how do you expect Avigilon to split between the two new segments? I guess another way to ask that is, how much of Avigilon is coming from software as a percentage of sales?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, Kyle. It's Gino. In rough terms, about 20% of Avigilon is software.","Kyle McNealy - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Okay. Great. And then \u2013 sorry. And then...","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","No, go ahead.","Kyle McNealy - Jefferies LLC","They recently launched a cloud subscription service in March. I'm wondering if there's anything you could add in terms of any traction initially that they're getting with that or I guess do you see it being incremental to the hardware-only sales motions that they had previously, or is it going to replace something that they're already doing? Any additional color on that would be great.","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, Kyle. So \u2013 this is Jack. So, they've announced Avigilon Blue, which you referenced is a cloud-based solution. Early days, we've had success obviously starting to sign-up customers. I think the interesting thing with Avigilon Blue is we actually believe it will open up new opportunities into the small- and medium-sized business. So not \u2013 think of it not as cannibalistic to their existing business \u2013 but actually customer expansion in terms of its opportunity and what we can deliver.","Kyle McNealy - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Awesome. And one last one for me, on your Services and Software segment and the margin improvement that you're getting there, just curious if you can add anything in terms of what's driving that? Is that scale in the managed services business? Is it a greater mix of software, pricing activity, a combination of all those things? Anything else you can add would be great.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's a couple of things. Mainly, Andrew Sinclair has talked about and he mentioned this at the Financial Analyst Meeting that while we're the only ones building an end-to-end platform there, we have the opportunity to build an integrated suite. And as a result of different acquisitions we've made, we've had some duplicative R&D. And we have to, at the end of the day, platform that comprehensive solution. As he does that over the next 12 to 24 months, I think there's margin improvement associated with that.","The second is what you mentioned. I think there's continued scale opportunities on the services' side, not only in back-office delivery as we optimize and add additional managed services contracts, but I think we can and will do a better job more efficiently on field deployment as well. So, those are the biggest opportunities that present themselves, and Jack and Kelly and Andrew and Bruce have identified those and are beginning to work those now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Tindle of Raymond James.","Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks and good evening. Greg, you mentioned kind of building a recurring revenue stream on that new segment line. And I just wanted to know, do you have a recurring revenue target mix? And how much do you think that you need mix from that to get to that 30% operating margin that you were talking about for 2019?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","We don't have a target. Obviously, we'd like to see it grow. But quite frankly, both segments are important and we anticipate growth in both segments continually. My assumption around operating margin improvement in \u2013 let's just take 2019 \u2013 doesn't necessarily assume any dramatic difference in contribution of the 32%. I think we can get after its existing stream now and get better flow through on the P&L.","Adam Tindle - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And, Gino, I just wanted to check in on cash flow guidance for the year. I think you'd need about $1 billion in operating cash flow in the second half in order to hit the previously stated guidance and it'd be more than 100% of net income conversion. Can you maybe just reaffirm, does that cash flow guidance still stand and then talk about the buckets that help with those assumptions? Thank you.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, Adam. It certainly still stands. We feel incrementally better about the $1.4 billion, and historically that's been our conversion, to over 100% of net income.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research Company.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up. When you look at surveillance and NextGen 9-1-1 today, those opportunities, could you talk a little bit about how you see the budget availability for those projects and initiatives right now? And then if it's not there, when you do talk to a customer and they decide to make the decision to move forward, can you walk us through the process of approximately times for that start to translate to revenue as they work through deriving the funding and getting that money realized?","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Ben, this is Jack. First of all, good question. There's two things. One of the reasons we've made the acquisitions in the command center and the organic R&D investments we've made is because we looked at that as being a distinct and additive funding stream to our customers. We didn't necessarily play in the 9-1-1 funding space before. So, as you start to drill that down in any particular project, typically these command center \u2013 9-1-1, radio console, computer-aided dispatch \u2013 are around a two year selling cycle.","Typically, they would \u2013 sometimes they'll write it homegrown \u2013 oftentimes they'll hire a consultant. They'll put it out for RFP. They'll down select into maybe two, sometimes three vendors, at which time we'll go through a demonstration. After the demonstration, there's typically anytime \u2013 anywhere between a three- to six-month process whereby they make an award decision, negotiate a contract and then have to take it to a county board. So all in, you're typically looking at a two-year sales cycle, but the important thing for us was it was incremental to government capital budgets. It's 9-1-1 money, which was new money that we had no ability to compete for in the past.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. And then, on another item, we're going on maybe six or seven years removed from the sweet spot of the narrow-banding initiative. And I'm curious if you've seen any layering effects where some of those customers who are starting to come back to the table with refreshed behavior on handhelds or anything else if you feel like you're starting to see some of those customers coming back to the table? Thanks.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Ben, we are \u2013 I mean, I think that typically if we look at it, it was early 2010, 2011, 2012. I mean, it was really a three to four year kind of period where different customers depending on their planning made investments. So, we think there are \u2013 we think there's opportunities. And obviously through our Know Your Customer and data-driven sales initiatives we've run, we've been in front of those customers. The thing that the sales teams also excited for is as Bruce and his team have made investments and we've got some portfolio expansion underway, which we're actually excited about as we look into 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you, Greg and Gino. I have one question for each of you and I'll ask them at the same time and you can take them in any order you want. Potentially, this one might be more for Greg, but there's a lot of articles out there about the FirstNet devices, the enabled devices, once they get up and running that they'll be heavily subsidized at first. Is that true? And does that impact your financial model at all? Who's the subsidy provider there on that? Or is it more that's what the media says and maybe those are test devices? How should we think about the subsidies on some of those devices?","And then my second question, which is probably more for Gino is, you had a very good Financial Analyst Day earlier in the year and a lot of the investors and buy side and sell side are feeling very comfortable with your financial liquidity model. And now it appears you're making some changes for. What's really behind the model changes for your reporting structure? Are there certain things you really, really, really want to drive home to focus on in the next few years? And then, are there a few things that we need to deemphasize that maybe you have historically in the past? Thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, Jim. And the answer to your first question, no. What you referenced on FirstNet and subsidies doesn't affect the way we are modeling the business or thinking about FirstNet either this year or beyond. By the way, FirstNet revenue contribution was virtually zero again for us in Q2 as it was in Q1. I think that the kind of subscriber that we were looking for hasn't materialized there. That's fine. A lot of the FirstNet users that are incrementally coming on board are using commercial push to talk over cellular in the form of Kodiak, which is supplied by us.","So that's a good thing. But \u2013 and also I think even as AT&T referenced, some of the early users of FirstNet were already existing AT&T users that are switching over to a FirstNet plan. So, we don't see material growth in FirstNet to-date and our expectations for the full year in 2018 are minimal.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","And Jim, this is Gino. With respect to the new segment reporting, really, many reasons behind it. Really the idea, when we talk to services, historically, it was a combination of managed and support services and systems integration and they're two very different things with different margin profiles and invariably with the discussion centered on managed and support services. So, the effort is to be clearer about the new Services and Software is overwhelmingly recurring, clearer about our recurring revenue business versus the one-time Products and Systems Integration business and the different operating margin profile associated with each one of them.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you so much for the details and clarification. Just appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Fitzsimmons of Morningstar. Mr. Fitzsimmons, you may want to check your mute switch or return to your telephone handset. Your line is open.","William Fitzsimmons - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Good afternoon. And thanks for taking my questions. First for Gino, the new segment breakout obviously provides some good clarity into recurring revenue. If possible, could you provide any additional clarity or possibly a percentage breakdown of revenue that both Avigilon and then your public safety command center assets contributed to the top line in the quarter?","And then maybe I'll concurrently give my question to Greg. Obviously, Avigilon and your public safety command center assets continue to grow briskly. But it's almost as if the past couple of quarters and at your Analyst Day, basically assert that core LMR demand is very strong. Are there any additional insights you can kind of give us into what's helping drive that? Obviously, the economy is doing very well and Motorola continues to do well relative to competitors. But are there any additional conversations you've been having lately with your customers when you go to market? Thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. I think \u2013 thanks, William \u2013 I think on the overall demand, there's a combination of things. Obviously, the economy here in the U.S. and North America as our anchor tenant, continues to perform very well. It's not often we see synchronized global growth in each theater. I think it's a combination of things. Environmentally, the environment's good; demand for Land Mobile Radio systems and people understand its criticality is high, and it's pretty high consistently.","I think there's also things internally on the management side, whether it's compensation adjustments, sales coverage, stronger indirect channels, EMEA work that was done very well by Viv Francis and Mark Schmidl out there, I think execution is better. By the way, there's better products as well. And I'm talking LMR. Not just this year but some things on tap for next year. So, the inorganic growth is excellent and the organic growth is excellent. And I think we largely are either holding or taking share and the execution is pretty sound. I don't know, Jack, if you want to add anything on that?","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","No. I think you nailed it, Greg.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","And, William, on the segment reporting, well, we won't dimensionalize subsegment what we have talked about the relationship between software and services within the segment if software being approximately $400 million for the full year. And you can think about that as the starting point in the new Services and Software segment.","William Fitzsimmons - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Perfect. Thank you both.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Coster of JPMorgan.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Regarding Airwave, I may be missing some of the nuances here. It sounds like it's extended for many years, the same magnitude and mix moving forward as well.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Well, we don't know. Ultimately, we'll see how the agreement plays out. I think the discussions with the customer remain ongoing. There could be different terms with different financial contributions that we continue to weigh back and forth with them. But our view is completely unchanged that we think that network will be in for a very, very long time beyond 2020. And as I referenced, we made also great progress on ESN and what the customers call the re-plan or the reset, which I think will be a standards-based solution vis-\u00e0-vis Kodiak.","By the way, with that extension of Airwave, obviously, there'll be device opportunities that are contemplated. And given the fact that Airwave will be in for much longer, Jack's team has already engaged in conversations with the customer this year and I'm sure that will go into next year for device refresh because of the new understanding that Airwave will be extended.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, are we to assume that the overall economics, hoping much of a wash relative to what you see today? Obviously a different mix.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Well, I think at the end of the day, if I were to answer that, it would really be speculative because we're still in discussion with the customer. But I would expect in the not too distant future a matter of months to be able to provide the clarity, both around the term and the financial contribution associated with it. And we feel \u2013 I'd just say this \u2013 we feel very good about where we are in the planning cycle.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. And then just quickly on the end-to-end solution in software for the first responder market. It does sound like you've got a huge head start over everyone else in a very fragmented space. And yet in the context of the software, which is fairly modest proportion of your overall revenue, it doesn't feel like it's going to be particularly material any time soon, but am I mistaken, I mean, can you see this being 5%, 10% revenues in the next couple of years?","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","So, Paul, this is Bruce Brda. I'll take the question. With the footprint that we have from the assets we've either bought or built, we're in over 70% of the public safety command centers in North America. That gives us the ability as we platform to cross-sell across applications. So, we think we're extremely well positioned. As you pointed out, the market is fragmented and nobody has an end-to-end suite of solutions like us. We've built a really good set of assets there. As Greg said, we expect this segment to grow at a rate faster than Products and SI, and software will be one of those contributors.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research Holdings.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon, gentlemen. A question for you here on Avigilon. Avigilon has been in your portfolio now for several months. And you guys have high-teens growth as you guys mentioned. Just want to know, are your starting to see some of the synergies that you expected or is it still too early and this is true, just organic growth from the company that you acquired?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Keith, we are. I think we are seeing some revenue synergies. I'd caution the one thing as we talked about, laid out in the front and even when we first made the acquisition, we felt like our biggest synergy was going to be in the U.S. Federal Government and it's the U.S., state, local governments. And I'd just mind you the sales cycle on those things, as I just noted, is minimally a 12 month kind of sales cycle.","And so work done, pipeline being built. By the way, incremental sales investment that we think was needed subject matter expertise in public safety, it's underway. So that's the first thing. The second thing was our North America channel. We got to, obviously, have a very strong and proud channel, many of which carry competitive video solutions.","So, we're now working with those channel partners, obviously, to go and bring Avigilon into their portfolio. And obviously with the loyal relationship that we've had with those, we actually are starting to see not only some opportunities but some deals that have been closed, that are Enterprise-like deals that will close a little quicker than the larger government solutions that we're working on.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. And then it looks like (42:41) obviously are Chinese based. And it looks like they're going to be blocked from being able to do (43:14) government infrastructures and obviously OEM (43:16) other guys out there. Is there a way to quantify or think about the opportunity you guys may have from those guys being excluded from being (43:00)?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. Well, I mean, there is \u2013 as you referenced \u2013 the Authorization Act was approved by the House and Senate, it's awaiting the President's signature. It's clearly a positive. But I think the most important is the country and the government's doing the right thing from a national security and intellectual property protection standpoint. There's companies that are named specifically in there. We haven't modeled anything this year or next year, but I'm heartened and pleased that the government is taking these steps. And I think there'll be procurement guidelines and grant prohibitions around how Chinese electronic companies are purchased and\/or deployed and what they're eligible for from a grant standpoint, that's in the NDAA, that I think is positive for us. But most importantly, I think from a national security standpoint, the country is doing the right thing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you. The first question I have is, you did mention a little bit about command center a little bit earlier, but what I really want to know is as you enter this market and you further expand \u2013 and I know you have some discipline and some knowledge regarding your customers, et cetera \u2013 what I really wanted to know is like how are you measuring uptake and when should we really start to see statistics on specifically this dynamic? And is there any competition coming up that you are potentially facing in the market for this service?","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. This is Bruce. I'll take the question. I'm sure Jack will jump in. This market is extremely fragmented. I think that was mentioned earlier. And with the assets we've bought and built, we have a complete suite. Nobody else comes close to what we have done. In the short term, cross-sell between those applications is the short-term opportunity. And that's really being led by the integration that we're doing between the individual applications that adds incremental value to the customers.","Jack, I'll see if you want to add anything on top?","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. So, Sami, it's really we kind of looked at is we had a multitude of products in the command center. We've now moved to where we're selling coupled solutions. And we've had very good success, particularly with the Emergency CallWorks and the Spillman acquisition that are really kind of mid-tier cities. And we've had in the twenties where we've gone in and sold those things as coupled solutions in the U.S. alone.","As Bruce and team start to build that into a platform, that's where we start to have multiple opportunities within given years within the same customer. So, it's really an evolution for us in the command center, but I think we've got the right focus, resource, and we've seen early wins, particularly with the acquisitions as I laid out with Emergency CallWorks and Spillman.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. Thank you. And then just \u2013 so, it clearly looks like you have control over this part of the market. And when customers are not upgrading or not opting into this service, what is the rationale? Is it budget? Is it head count? Is it skill? Like what exactly is the bottleneck and adoption for specifically this service?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Could you clarify when you say that service? Do you mean Support and Managed Services or our command center applications?","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Command center applications?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. Each of the individual applications call taking, CAD, records and councils, have typically been refreshed at different cycles in the past, which is really I think plays into our hand. So, as long as we're in with one and we're in with one in more than 70% of the PSAPS across the U.S., we have the ability as the refresh cycles for the individual applications come due to participate. And those I don't think there's any hindrance in those refresh cycles. It's not a funding issue. It's just an evolution or cycle that we have to let pass to be able to participate for the upgrades sleeve-by-sleeve in the command center.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it.

Welcome to our call to discuss fourth quarter and full year results. With me this morning are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mark Moon, Executive Vice President and President, Sales and Product Operations. Greg and Gino will review our results, along with commentary, and Mark will join for the Q&A portion of the call.","Earlier this morning, we posted an earnings presentation and press release on our website.

Brown","Good morning. And thanks, Shep, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today.","Q4 was a solid quarter for Motorola Solutions. We finished 2013 on a positive note. We had growth in both businesses, improved operating margin, delivered double-digit EPS growth, built backlog and generated strong operating cash flow.","As I reflect on the year, there are a few thoughts I'd like to note. And first, although revenue was flat for the year, we still expanded operating margin, delivered solid EPS growth and cash flow and returned $2 billion of capital to our shareholders. Second, the Government business turned in a very solid year, demonstrating resiliency, especially off of a record year in 2012. This comes despite a challenging second half in our federal business related to the U.S. government shutdown and declines in APME. Europe and Africa and North America state and local were growth drivers for us. We closed 2013 with a record backlog position in our Government segment, up $450 million, and have signed some significant multiyear deals that will build the base of recurring revenue streams for future years.","Third, we continued to see encouraging trends in our Enterprise business. The business grew slightly in Q4, the second quarter of growth in a row, driven by stronger-than-expected performance in North America, continued strength in Asia and solid performance in Europe. New products are gaining traction, and our backlog in Enterprise is also up. And finally, we sharpened our focus, proactively taking steps to improve our cost structure and improve our competitive position overall. This positions the business well for sustained operating leverage and cash generation going forward.","Now to our results. This morning, we reported fourth quarter sales of $2.5 billion, an increase of 3% from Q4 of last year. On a GAAP basis, net earnings from continuing operations were $1.31 per share compared to $1.18 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net earnings from continuing operations were $1.67 per share compared to $1.10 per share in Q4 of last year. For the full year, revenues were flat at $8.7 billion, while we increased non-GAAP operating margins by 30 basis points. For the remainder of this call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise noted.","Our Government business revenues increased 4% for the quarter. We saw solid double-digit growth in infrastructure and deployment services for both ASTRO and TETRA. Government sales increased 1% for the full year coming off of a record 12% revenue growth in 2012. Our strong product portfolio and expanded solutions capabilities have positioned us well to take advantage of the demand drivers of the analog-to-digital transition, aging public safety infrastructure and expansion opportunities in the verticals beyond public safety, demand drivers which continue as catalysts for future growth.","In the Enterprise business, sales were up slightly compared to the year-ago quarter and increased 1% when excluding the decline of iDEN. On a full year basis, Enterprise revenue declined 2%, as we experienced cyclical weakness in the first half of the year, although we believe the trends in our core Enterprise business are demonstrating a return to growth.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Gino to discuss our results in more detail, and then I'll return to get into more operational highlights and provide additional color on our business performance.","Gino A. Bonanotte","Thanks, Greg.","On our last call, I talked about managing costs and improving cash flow as 2 of our top priorities. In Q4, we saw encouraging results in both areas. We continue to make good progress on the cost front, and our intense focus on cash flow produced strong results for Q4. We will continue to remain focused on cash and operating leverage.","Now moving to the results. Q4 sales grew 3%, in line with our expectations. On a full year basis, revenue was flat at $8.7 billion. Government posted strong growth of 4%, fueled by 25% growth in Europe and Africa and continued strength in North America state and local government sales. Strong results in infrastructure and deployment services were the drivers. 2013 full year Government sales grew 1% to $6 billion while delivering solid operating margin expansion.","Q4 sales for the Enterprise business were up slightly at $736 million. Excluding iDEN, revenues grew 1%. Both Asia and Europe turned in solid growth for the quarter. For the full year, Enterprise posted revenues of $2.7 billion, declining 2% year-over-year. Although it was a challenging year, we saw the trajectory of this business improve meaningfully in the second half and believe the segment can return to growth in 2014.","Turning to operating expenses. In Q4, operating expenses were $710 million, down $50 million from the year-ago quarter. Full year OpEx was down approximately $120 million versus 2012. This decrease was driven by a number of structural cost improvements we implemented during the year, as well as reduced variable incentives.","Operating earnings in Q4 were a record at $519 million or 20.7% of sales compared to $476 million or 19.5% in Q4 of 2012.","Other income and expense was a net expense of $22 million in the quarter compared to a net expense of $16 million in Q4 of 2012. This expense was lower than we expected due to investment gains and several other items. We continue to expect approximately $40 million in quarterly expenses for this line item.","Our effective tax rate was 12.5% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. For 2014, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 33 and 40 -- 33% and 34%.","EPS in the fourth quarter was $1.67, which represents a 52% increase year-over-year. For the full year, EPS increased 48% to $4.73. This EPS increase included a onetime tax benefit of $1.25 per share associated with the implementation of our foreign holding company structure. Excluding the benefit of implementing the new structure, EPS growth was up double digits in Q4 and 9% for the year. We provided a schedule in our website of the quarterly EPS tax benefit in 2013 for the purposes of comparing core EPS growth in 2014.","Turning to our regional view of results. North America declined 1%, driven by a mid single-digit decline in Enterprise, offset by 1% growth in Government. For the full year, North America declined 2% as a result of mid single-digit declines in Enterprise and flat Government sales. State and local was a strong performer for the region, while the federal business declined approximately $150 million.","In Europe and Africa, revenue was up 16%, driven by strong double-digit growth in Government, along with solid results in Enterprise. Full year EA results were strong as well with 12% growth. Significant project rollouts and continued momentum in TETRA helped drive this strength, while Enterprise also provided growth, with some notable pilot projects for our new Android devices.","Asia Pacific and Middle East sales declined 1% in Q4. The region saw a continued momentum in Enterprise with double-digit growth, while Government turned in single-digit declines. APME declined 4% for the full year, with double-digit decline in Government. Enterprise grew double digits for the year with good results through the entire year. This region is showing good momentum, including a substantial increase in backlog, which will help it return to growth in 2014.","Latin America declined 2% for the quarter, with a decline in Enterprise and growth in Government. Latin America full year revenues declined 8%, driven by iDEN declines in Enterprise, while Government posted a slight increase.","Our services business finished with a strong quarter and a terrific year. Total services grew 12% over Q4 of 2012, with double-digit growth in Enterprise and Government. On a full year basis, our services business grew 10% over last year, with mid single-digit growth in Government and double-digit growth in Enterprise.","Moving on to cash flow. Cash generated from operating activities in the quarter was outstanding at $741 million, a quarterly record. The improvement was a result of actions we implemented to improve payables, accounts receivable and collections related to long-term contracts. For the full year, cash flow was $944 million. For 2014, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.1 billion.","We ended the year with $3.2 billion in total cash and $2.5 billion in debt. During Q4, we repurchased $362 million of stock. For the year, we repurchased 29 million shares for a total of $1.7 billion. In the 2.5 years since we initiated this plan, we have repurchased 105 million shares, or $5.2 billion, at an average price of approximately $50 a share. As a result, we have reduced our net share count by 26%. In addition, we paid $80 million in dividends during the quarter and $292 million for the full year. Through Q4, we have paid $634 million in dividends since reinstating our dividend in late 2011.","Before turning to outlook, I want to mention a few items related to pension. Our total underfunded U.S. pension balance decreased from $2.8 billion at the end of 2012 to $1.2 billion ending 2013. U.S. pension expense will decline from $110 million to approximately $80 million in 2014. The minimum cash contribution to our U.S. pension will increase by $150 million to approximately $300 million. The funding increase is a result of the MAP-21 exclusion in 2013 allowing a lower minimum contribution last year.","Now turning to our outlook. We expect 2014 sales to be flat to up 2%. This outlook is predicated on low single-digit growth in Government and mid single-digit growth in Enterprise, excluding iDEN, or flat to low single-digit inclusive of a $100 million iDEN decline. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 18.5%. This margin outlook incorporates slightly lower year-over-year operating expenses and gross margins comparable to 2013.","In Q1, we expect sales to decline 4% to 6% year-over-year. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.46 to $0.52 from continuing operations based on Q4 ending share count. This compares to non-GAAP EPS of $0.66 per share in Q1 of 2013. This outlook excludes items historically highlighted in our quarterly earnings release.","Let me provide some insight into our full year and Q1 sales expectations.","Our year-over-year backlog is up approximately $500 million. This increase is driven by multiyear projects which begin to generate revenue in mid-2014 and beyond and provide long-term revenue streams. However, the Government backlog scheduled to ship in Q1 is down approximately $125 million from last year. As a result, we expect Q1 to be lower as a percentage of full year revenue compared to the past several years.","To sum up, we are pleased with the overall backlog position and remain confident in our position in both segments.","I'll now turn it over to Greg for business highlights from the quarter.","Gregory Q. Brown","Gino, thanks. In Government, our sales for the quarter were $1.8 billion, up 4% over Q4 2012. Operating earnings were a record 22.5% of sales compared to 21.8% in Q4 of last year. Growth in the quarter in our Government business was driven by higher ASTRO and TETRA infrastructure and deployment services sales. Growth for the full year was driven by Europe and Africa and strength in our state and local business despite, as Gino mentioned, approximately $150 million in federal sales declines that came largely in the second half of this past year. Profitability also increased based on lower operating expenses and solid gross margins. Across the portfolio, full year ASTRO sales were up single digits and TETRA grew solid double digits. Growth in these businesses was driven this year by a double-digit increase in the sales of new system infrastructure, which is typically a leading indicator for future subscriber revenues. Our PCR sales declined single digits following record double-digit growth in 2012, although our results were consistent with the overall market performance.","In ASTRO, this quarter marked a new release of our market-leading and standards-compliant P25 technology. We already have over 35 customers upgraded to this latest release, with 49 more in backlog scheduled for 2014 upgrades. This latest version of ASTRO features a seamless migration path with improved serviceability and scalability. Customers investing in these next-generation systems have the assurance that new radios with enhanced features remain interoperable and backward compatible with the existing equipment while preparing for future technology migrations.","During the quarter, we signed several large deals, including a number of wins at the county level with the counties of Cobb, Georgia for $27 million; Albany in New York for $25 million; Waukesha and Milwaukee, Wisconsin for $23 million; Hamilton, Indiana for $21 million; San Bernardino, California for $18 million; Florence in South Carolina for $12 million; Grand Prairie, Texas for $12 million; and Harford, Maryland for $11 million. We also were awarded a $17 million contract from the Navy to service and maintain radio systems at over 50 military installations. And the Tennessee department of safety, which had previously self-maintained their ASTRO system, recently contracted with us to maintain, monitor and support their network for 10 years in conjunction with their new ASTRO P25 system, for a total contract of $52 million. And the recent $24 million contract with the City of Charlotte includes upgrades of their ASTRO network with our assurance program to keep their software and hardware refreshed with the latest technology enhancements.","P25 is truly a global standard for mission-critical communications, and our ASTRO systems are now deployed in over 60 countries. We won several international deals this quarter, including the country of Latvia for $18 million to deploy a nationwide system that replaces 2 legacy systems that were 15 years old. And Royal Malaysia Police, operating one of the largest ASTRO deployments outside of the U.S., added several million dollars of new services and signed a $25 million contract that transitions management of their network to us from a formally self-maintained model. We also signed awards with the Israel fire brigade for $20 million and the S\u00e3o Paulo military police for several million dollars.","We're driving growth in verticals beyond public safety as well. This quarter, we secured contracts with Xcel Energy for $26 million; Nassau County, New York, public works for $11 million; and the L.A. Department of Power and Water for several million dollars.","We continue to make tailored investments for expanded verticals. As an example, new features now available in 7.14 ASTRO system release include special alerts for the mining market and enhanced data for meter-reading capabilities to serve the utilities market. Our expanded PCR portfolio now includes several digital radio platforms complete with multisite coverage, which is being adopted by customers in energy utilities as well as manufacturing. For example, this quarter, customers like Cenovus Energy in Canada and Sam Houston Electric in Texas recently chose MOTOTRBO to serve multiple sites; while Agrium, a large fertilizer company in Canada, is deploying MOTOTRBO as well.","Looking back on the year. We secured large contracts in actually what was one of our best large-deal years in our history: Los Angeles; Queensland, Australia; Libya; Tennessee; and our first international public safety LTE deal. Deployments of this size and complexity lead to long-term revenue streams over multiple-year rollouts. We've also made progress expanding our services business and, in particular, lifecycle management contracts. These agreements provide customers with the ability to stay current on the latest software versions with routine upgrades. In the past 3 years, we've gone from only a handful of these contracts to now almost 200. In this year, in ASTRO alone, we signed 39 new lifecycle management agreements, with over 50 million in backlog growth. These contracts also tend to be long in duration. For example, 40% of the new agreements we signed this year were for 10 years.","We had one of our best years in TETRA, with strong double-digit growth driven by the continued expansion of our infrastructure footprint with this mission-critical standard. Our expanded device portfolio is also being well received. As an example, our new TETRA 6750 model, the first-ever camera-equipped TETRA public safety radio, is now shipping and receiving great customer feedback, including a readers' choice award from a leading German professional telecommunications magazine.","This quarter, we renewed a multiyear support contract for Airwave's critical communications network, one of the largest TETRA networks in the world delivering voice and data services to the U.K.'s emergency services. And we signed a large multiyear public safety contract with Libya for $187 million to provide countrywide coverage. The Royal Brunei Police Force also selected our TETRA technology for a $6 million system in Q4. TETRA also continues to be the technology of choice for rail transport communication systems across the globe, as demonstrated by contracts this quarter from Chongqing Metro in China and an award with St. Petersburg Metro in Russia.","The decline this year in PCR was primarily driven by lower sales in North America, a market that grew almost 20% in 2012 because of U.S. narrowbanding. We're making investments in this business to extend our leadership in the market, with continued growth potential. For example, we acquired Twisted Pair Solutions, which further extends our MOTOTRBO radio push-to-talk communication to commercial smartphone device users as well. One of the key long-term growth drivers for the PCR market is the overwhelming majority of the 40 million radios deployed in the global market that is still largely analog technology, and we are leading that transition to digital with the most comprehensive digital portfolio in the professional and commercial market. And finally, we signed our first public safety LTE contract with a country outside the U.S. for a multiyear deployment that includes our infrastructure and devices valued at nearly $100 million. We're very pleased with securing our first international LTE contract and anticipate this revenue will begin in 2015.","We have a great product portfolio that positions us well on the continued migration to digital, the continuing need for interoperability and the high-critical nature and prioritization of mission-critical public safety. I should also mention that our backlog in Government is at a record level, with much of the composition of this backlog being multiyear in nature, as we execute on large contract deployments and incremental managed services opportunities.","Moving on to Enterprise. In Enterprise, our sales for the quarter were $736 million, a slight increase. Profitability for the segment increased, driven by lower operating expenses. Operating earnings were 16.5% of sales compared to 14% in Q4 of last year. On a full year basis, the iDEN segment -- excuse me, the Enterprise segment declined 2%. And excluding the decline in iDEN, the Enterprise business grew 2%, with an improved trajectory in the second half of the year.","We believe the trends in Enterprise are favorable. Throughout this past year, our focus has been on operationally and financially improving the business, and the portfolio is getting stronger with investments in Android and new devices like the TC55. We're moving from trial deployments for this device and other new products to customer adoption and we are pleased with the improved revenue traction.","On a full year basis, mobile computing grew single digits and data capture and wireless LAN both declined single digits. Now having said that, data capture and wireless LAN grew double digits in Q4.","As Android has emerged, we are well positioned with a truly enterprise-grade portfolio, complete with our own Motorola Extensions to enhance, integrate and secure the Android OS. We have 4 new models running on the current version of Android and our workforce MC67 is available in both Windows and Android. Additionally, several strategic accounts have begun to deploy these devices, such as Spanish Post ordering over 10,000 of our new Android-based TC55. It's a pocket-sized touch computer which merges the features of our traditional enterprise-class mobile computer with the form factor and functionality of the smartphone. In Q4, we won other large mobile computing deals within our transportation and logistics customer base, including a multimillion dollar order from the Italian Pos. APC Overnight, the U.K.'s largest next-day delivery network, purchased over 2,000 MC67s for their new proof-of-delivery system. And TNT Express in Europe ordered 2,600 MC67s for their needs.","In advanced data capture, Q4 growth was driven by strong sales through our distribution channels and several large direct deals. For example, Wal-Mart continues to invest, with a recent order of 10,000 handheld scanners along with 4,000 of our first-ever bioptic scanner, the MP6000, for use in their checkout counters, displacing the longtime incumbent in this strategic account. We recently announced the blade, the DS4800, an innovatively designed scanner that complements the customer experience in high-end retail with stylish ergonomics and customized bezel, together with best-in-class 2D scanning.","Wireless LAN was a bright spot in Q4 and grew double digits. Bed Bath & Beyond recently chose our WLAN solution in a managed services delivery model, which will be deployed in all of their 1,275 locations in the United States and Canada. We also recently won a large contract with Caesars Entertainment to deploy over 45,000 access points in over 35 of their properties to deliver guest access, workforce solutions and location-based services on a secured network, with the goal of providing an incredible guest experience.","I'm encouraged by our Q4 results in Enterprise. And as we look forward to 2014, we're well positioned here competitively. The National Retail Federation's annual showcase was just last week in New York. I met with several large customers that are excited about investments that they're making in our Enterprise products to improve customer service and capture customer demand, whether it's in the store or online.","In closing. Q4 was a good finish to a challenging year. In the quarter, we grew in both segments; achieved record operating earnings of $519 million, record operating margin of 20.7% and record quarterly operating cash flow of $741 million. We also made numerous changes this year to become more efficient, and our 21,000 people remain focused on execution and returning this firm to growth in 2014. The fundamental demand drivers for our business remain solid, and we continue to invest and innovate for profitable growth. And we plan to build on the momentum that we demonstrated this past quarter as we ended the year and move into '14.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks, Greg. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","First, a clarification. You mentioned you expect iDEN to be down $100 million in 2014. Do you have the basis of what that was in 2013? And then secondly, on the gross margins, it was down pretty meaningfully year-over-year in Q4 and I think you're calling for it flat next year. Can you talk a little bit about what is driving kind of gross margin in any particular quarter and why this quarter was kind of weaker relative to Q3 or the year-ago quarter?","Gregory Q. Brown","So 2 things. First, on iDEN, iDEN was about $185 million in 2013. We expect it to be down approximately $100 million to $85 million. We have very good visibility, obviously, with that business given its contracting and pretty located base that we have a very good understanding of. Gross margins were compressed largely due to mix, which we had higher infrastructure and deployment services in 2013. And when we talk about deployment services, we're talking really about installation and integration services. So it compressed gross margin in Q4 and that mix carries over into Q1, although overall for the full year, we're anticipating gross margins for full year 2014 to be comparable for full year 2013.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kulbinder Garcha with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A question for Greg, just on revenue growth for the overall business. I guess, in '13, you didn't kind of hit your target range and there was a number of issues. This year, you are saying the same thing. I understand the timing of some of these things, but I guess, what confidence do you have that MSI is above a mid single-digit grower, let's say, from '15 and beyond? What gives you that confidence in what you've previously discussed? Is that the target growth rate for the company? And then just a clarification on the nearer term: So just to be clear, the Government business has a very good backlog, but you just guys aren't going to be converting that in the first half, and that creates kind of an air pocket, hence the down revenues we're going to see there. Is that the right way of thinking about that?","Gregory Q. Brown","Kulbinder, 2 things. I have much higher confidence, in the business, than I did several quarters ago about our ability to call it. So if I take you back a couple of quarters -- and I understand, when we were guiding to be approximately flat for the remainder of -- or for full '13, there were folks that didn't think we could get there given the kind of ramp in the second half that was required and we pointed people to what we called the aged backlog being up about 100 million in this past Q4, which ended up converting as expected and materializing in line with what we thought. As we think about this year, and you call it an air pocket for Q1, I'll come back to that, we believe that the full year guidance comports well. Even with Q1's compression, the remaining 9 months is -- has the business growing at 2% to 4%. That's off of a 9-month compare on the same period of '13 of being approximately flat. For the full year, we expect Government to grow low single digits, and Enterprise mid single digits without iDEN. I think we have pretty good visibility to that, and I think that we have shored up a number of processes on our ability to guide and forecast the business. In Q1, as you referenced, Kulbinder, it's really a timing issue. And we don't manage the business, of course, by quarter, we look at the full year. I love the fact that the backlog is up in both businesses. We have very good visibility into the aged backlog composition of that, meaning the backlog to be delivered in Q1 and in fiscal 2014. We see good trends on the Enterprise business that we referenced and we're expecting Enterprise to go -- grow in Q1. So I feel good about where we are as a business, the long-term contracts, multiyear contracts that we've signed, which over time will give us even greater predictability on annuity revenue streams. So that's what gives me confidence as I look into '14.","Operator","And we'll go next to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up to that question. How does the backlog coverage for this year compare to what you typically enter the year with? And then I just had a clarification: When you talked about the $150 million decline in federal in the second half, was that a bit larger than you had expected? I think you had earlier indicated $100 million.","Gregory Q. Brown","So you're right. On the second part first, Simona, the $150 million turned out to be higher in the second half, but we still met full year guidance. And just to further extend your point, in 2014, we're not building into our overall revenue guidance some kind of significant snapback to the federal business. We're really projecting very modest increases in the U.S. federal business. On backlog, as we referenced, Q1 is just more of a timing issue. The remaining aged backlog for the 9-month ensuing period is at comparable levels to 2013.","Simona Jankowski - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I see. So despite the fact that backlog grew quite nicely, that's really kind of layered out over a number of years. It's not giving you any more visibility into this year than typical.","Gregory Q. Brown","That's right.","Mark F. Moon","That's correct.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ehud Gelblum with Citigroup.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So a couple of questions. First of all, have to dig a little bit more into this timing pushout in Q1, if we can get a little more detail on that. With the $150 million falloff in fed in second half of the year, does this Government downdraft in Q1 as air pocket, as mentioned before, a, is that related to lower fed, or is it related to LTE or anything that we can get our arms around? When did you get a sense that this was going to happen? Was this something that just happened around Christmas, that you got a phone call that it wouldn't be recognized in Q1? And if we can get a sense as to what type of work that is, what types of projects. And then should we be assuming that whatever we -- you were going to get in Q1 are now pushed out to Q2 and whatever you get in Q2 are now pushed out to Q3? And just trying to get also a sense as to, was this lost business, or was this business that literally just got pushed out and then pushed everything out 1 quarter in advance in the future? And then I have a follow-up.","Gino A. Bonanotte","Ehud, thank you for the question. This is Gino. A couple of items to note. You mentioned federal, and the $150 million decline last year was predominantly in the second half. So Q1 does have an element of federal to it, but it's generally across the Government segment. It's in state and local, federal and, to some extent, in other regions. The question on visibility and when did we begin to realize that Q1 may have an air pocket in it, is it was really as you say. As we were closing the quarter, Q4 is our largest-order quarter, approximately $3 billion in orders in Q4. And as we closed the quarter, we aged those projects and those orders over the course of the project life, and that's when the Q1 issue became pronounced that we had a scheduled delivery issue. Aged backlog, as we call it internally became, an issue.","Gregory Q. Brown","And just to add. It's -- we don't characterize it as business that's lost, and it's not LTE either.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But this was -- to follow up. This was, I'm assuming -- it doesn't sound as though it was one project or one group of projects that was pushed out from the same customer. It sounds as though it was spread up. It sounds like part of it was a continuation of fed, so you may had a little bit of insight ahead of time, but it sounds like just a coincidence that a large chunk of multiple projects from a lot of different places are being pushed out. Or is there some structural third reason, fear of government shutdown and, obviously, I don't know, state and local, something that is making a bunch of different customers push out? I'm just trying to get a little bit of visibility into why all of a sudden. I mean, we haven't seen that before. My other question had to do with pension. Now that your pension liability is down $1.6 billion, what does that -- what kind of dry powder does that give you for additional buybacks?","Mark F. Moon","Ehud, this is Mark, let me jump on the first piece, then I'll hand back to Gino for the pension liability. When we think about federal, as we talked about -- when we talked about the down in the last second half of $150 million, we're also coming against a very large order in federal in Q1 of last year, so the comparable was also tough in that particular piece. Gino spoke about the $3 billion of orders and how we aged the scheduled delivery of backlog here in the last couple of weeks. It was a nominal across the portfolio, different than just one customer pushing out. The mix was definitely tilted towards infrastructure and deployment services, which is longer range, and just the necessity of how it -- how the project will be deployed versus larger subscriber orders. The order flow in the last 2 weeks also, probably because of the holiday following -- falling in the middle of the last 2 weeks, was a little less than normal. Now overall trends are very good, so it's just those last 2 weeks which also may have impacted some of the Q1 volume, but again, it really is a Q1 anomaly. We look very strong. The demand is strong. And actually in Government, both in North America and around the world, we increased share in the year. So order demand is good, it happens just to be a Q1 timing issue.","Gino A. Bonanotte","And then Ehud, on the pension liability decreased, we've stated in the past and we continue to adhere to a net debt position by 2014. We've also talked about that we're comfortable based on our ability to generate cash, comfortable running a levered model. Certainly, that reduction gives us greater flexibility, but we think the adjusted leverage is still appropriate in the mid-2x range. And as we've discussed in the past, we expect to intend to hold onto our solid investment grade rating.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.","Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, I know you made some comments on this, Greg, at one of the recent tech conferences. Could you give us an update on your views on timing of LTE rollouts this year in the U.S.? Or really, that's like more next year, but I want your view on that in terms of how you're planning. And then back to an earlier question around the guidance for the year. If things go good in the back-end, and the following 9 months after Q1, why are better than planned, I should say, should say worse than planned also. What would have caused that relative to your plan for the year?","Gregory Q. Brown","On LTE -- first, Brian, thanks for the 2 questions. I'll start by, we're thrilled with the fact that we secured an approximately $100 million multiyear deal, our first internationally, outside the U.S. As we think about LTE revenue contribution overall for '14, we are not planning no more than $50 million in 2014 total revenues. I still -- we continue to work closely with FirstNet well here in the U.S. We are working on a couple of projects and we'll see if they are successful coming to conclusion, one in particular comes to mind that we're working on that could make a decision over the next few months. We'll see. In terms of the remainder of the year, I think we have been pretty disciplined in the guidance that we're giving in a variety of different contingency scenarios as Gino and I work pretty closely together. For the full year, factored into the full year revenue guidance, again we think about Government being up low single digits, Enterprise being up single -- excuse me, mid single digits, without iDEN. And that's really kind of the way we think about the balance of the year. It contemplates about 2% to 4% growth over the remaining 9 months against a flat period of compare. We've detailed, we've taken a detailed look at backlog, so we feel pretty good about the way we're calling the year.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andrew Spinola with Wells Fargo.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have a question about your operating expenses. If I take the guidance that you've given, say the midpoint of your revenue, the assumption that gross margin is unchanged next year. Is your -- and then all the put and takes around pension and bonus and other pay increases, things like that. Is your operating expense base, where it is now, going to get you to the 18.5% operating margin? Or do you need to look to make additional cuts to get there?","Gregory Q. Brown","I think -- high level, I think that, between the actions that we've taken in '13 that resulted in significant annualized savings, which is a tailwind, as well as pension savings with a tailwind, and then net it against the headwind of accruing back to 100% of variable compensation, we think those actions, when netted together, largely get us there to approximately 18.5% against the backdrop of the revenue guidance that we've given.","Andrew Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then, Greg, on the LTE win and the other possible awards that you might win this year, are any of the customers, new customers to you? So is LTE expanding your addressable market in any ways that maybe you could discuss so that we can think about your business going forward?","Gregory Q. Brown","Well, I think it expands the addressable market because it's a separate new network that's incremental to the narrowband LMR that's been deployed. In the win internationally, it's an existing customer, one that we've enjoyed a relationship with for decades. But having the fact that we have a public safety solution infrastructure, software and integrated devices does expand the addressable market. And in the one that I'm thinking about here domestically, it -- that too is also an existing Motorola Solutions customer, but if we were to succeed in closing that business, that too would be an expansion of the addressable market opportunity because Public Safety LTE and the addressable market is incremental to the public safety mission-critical land-mobile radio business.","Mark F. Moon","Andrew, just to further kind of clarify and amplify really what Greg said: The existing -- one of the large contracts that he highlighted that we received this year was from L.A. Regional Interoperable Communications for a land-mobile 2-way radio mission-critical network. LA-RICS is also a customer currently pursuing an LTE opportunity. So that is the reference that Greg just made. So really, this new LTE opportunity is indeed incremental because it's an addition to the multiyear mission-critical network they just bought. And again, we're in negotiations with that customer and optimistic about what will come in the near future.","Operator","And we'll go next to Peter Misek with Jefferies.","Peter Misek - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess I'm struggling a little bit as well with the margins, and I guess I have 2 questions. Firstly, as we look at the Enterprise performance, 2 quarters effectively of growth here on an adjusted basis. The business seems to have less and less to do with the Government side. The overlap, based on the work we've done, seems to be diminishing over time, not increasing. Does the thought process around maintaining ownership for that business continue? Or does it make sense, now that we're starting to see a stabilization, to actually explore a sale? And then on the margin side, still struggling on the operating margin guidance on how you get there when you look at the math of ramp, mathematically the ramp throughout the year. Maybe we can dive into the bridge from gross margin to operating margin just on the Government side, as that Government operating margin looks again mathematically to be a bar that's set far lower than we would have expected.","Gregory Q. Brown","Peter, so on the Enterprise business, I mean that we have 2 core businesses here in the firm. They're different, you're right, but they're also both very good businesses. Our focus has been and remains on improving the Enterprise business given some of the difficulties and challenging periods we had over the last few quarters. And we feel pretty good about where we are with this business. It's improving operationally. It's improving on backlog, up $50 million year-over-year. It's improving on new products, with 4 recently introduced Android products. The engagement, as I mentioned, with large customers at NRF was significantly, in tone, better than the last year or 2. We've extended the Motorola Extensions vis-\u00e0-vis security, device management, integration on our own software that we layer on top of Android. So I guess it's a long-winded way of saying, look, the Enterprise business is a good business. It's improving its position, that's been our focus. And we have a number of customers that are counting on us to deliver in Q1 and Q2 and for the remainder of the year, and that is our primary focus. And we think there can be a lot of value created by continuing to drive the improvement of that business.","Gino A. Bonanotte","And on gross margins, Peter, the -- we've said gross -- we expect gross margins to be comparable to 2013. And Greg talked about the tailwind in pension as well as reductions executed in 2013 that will realize -- will be realized in annual savings in 2014.","Peter Misek - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","But the question I was specifically asking is on the bridge. If we're comparable at roughly, call it, 50% gross margins given that revenues are expected to grow more than expenses, and you've walked through that, we would have expected more than an 80 basis point rise in operating margin based on your full year guidance. And guess -- I guess, the bridge I'm talking about, if we assume flat to low single-digit revenue growth and if we assume low single-digit operating expense declines, we're getting something that's closer to 19% operating margins. And so I guess, that math, I'm just curious if you can give a little bit more color on the puts and takes on that math, and whether we're thinking about this right or how should -- we should look at it in more detail.","Gino A. Bonanotte","So Peter, what we've said, margins comparable to 2013, we ended 2013 at 49.3%. So margin's comparable, and a reduction in OpEx gets us to the 18.5% from where we ended 2013.","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes. And the only thing I'd add is, the guidance of approximately 18.5%, and I've said this before in the past, it's net -- not to imply necessarily a ceiling either. So we're just trying to be prudent in our estimation given the 90 point -- 90 basis point improvement year-on-year. Gross margins will be comparable '14 versus '13. We do have lower iDEN revenues, but we also look at ASPs pretty carefully and we're comfortable with where we are on ASPs in both segments. So that's contemplated into the approximately 18.5%.","Operator","And we'll go next to Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I just wanted to dig into the LTE business. I know you talked about it not being a meaningful contributor this year, but looking out a few years, I just wanted to get a sense of a few things. First, could you talk a little bit about, when we think about the revenue distribution of those contracts, do you think it will be any different than ASTRO or TETRA when you look at the mix of infrastructure, devices and software and services? That's number one. And then number two, similar question but on margin profile. And with the margin profile, I just want to understand, given that there might be a little bit more standards-based air interfaces there, does that mean a more -- a much more competitive dynamic on the device piece of the business?","Gregory Q. Brown","Well, I'm going to turn it over to Mark to answer part of that. But just on the last part, Tim, the -- one of the things, I think, that's been very important from a competitive advantage and the way we approach this business strategically is a solutions orientation, so regardless P25 is an open interoperable standard as well with many competitors on the infrastructure and device side, but given our expertise, customization of software, existing relationships, we're able to drive a very successful franchise. LTE is also an open air interface standard, and our approach to that market is also through a solutions orientation, infrastructure, software, devices and an end-to-end orientation that reflects the expertise and the decades of experience we have in provisioning mission-critical communications. On the LMR side, it's narrowband. On the LTE side, it's broadband. But we've been very conscious of the R&D investments we've made to try to have that systems end-to-end orientation, to have that strong solution and business model that we think will be quite successful going forward.","Mark F. Moon","Tim, when we think about the revenue mix, both kind of where it physically will happen, we see it being fairly well balanced between international opportunities and U.S. opportunities. From the infrastructure subscriber question that you ask, I think it would be similar when you think about our traditional business in the mix of percentage of equipment, infrastructure equipment, versus devices. But what I do believe, following up on what Greg just described as the way we see the business evolving, you will see the services component. Because this will be a solutions delivery and operating some of these networks at a higher level, I think you'll see that services content continue to grow in this particular piece, just like we're seeing it grow in our other businesses today in longer-term agreements. So from a margin perspective, both as you think about services, infrastructure and what we see in the Public Safety LTE devices, I think, from a gross margin perspective, it will be somewhat less than what we see in our traditional business, but we do believe we can maintain the same level of operating margins within that business.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","I want to come back to the 1Q guidance, if you guys don't mind. I know this is going to be a topic of conversation amongst investors today. I guess, Greg, you made the point before that you have higher confidence in your ability to schedule out going forward. So the question is, of course, what gives you that higher confidence? And it certainly looks, if we look at your historically numbers in the Government sector, this is highly unusual that you're going to have such a decrease year-over-year in that segment. I guess, any other color that you can give to why that was, perhaps? And I know you touched on this number to a call here, but it still seems like something is missing here from the investor standpoint, trying to understand the lower guidance.","Gregory Q. Brown","Yes, I would summarize it this way. And I recognize that -- a number of questions around the topic. It's really about timing. And I don't mean to distract or take away from the realities of the Q1. It's the mix of the mix to higher infrastructure and deployment services and the way the orders flow through. We had a -- almost a $3 billion order quarter in Q4. It's a huge volume that comes in. A component of it is federal that we mentioned about it earlier, but quite frankly, I'm just not that concerned, nor is Gino. And I don't mean to blow by it, that's not at all what I'm trying to do, but we look at the business annually, we look at the backlog that's aged, we look at the engagements we're in. We're not contemplating significant LTE. And when I think about, can this business grow 2% to 4% for the ensuing 9 months over a flat compare with the same period, I think it's very reasonable. And I think it's in that context that we have higher confidence. When we come into a quarter, I've referenced, Mark and Gino have referenced, that we have 80% -- approximately 80% visibility into a quarter. That too was unchanged. About 50% from backlog, 30% of what we characterize in our own vernacular as run rate, which is add-on and additional services and things with very little variability. And then there's about 20% of the quarter that we need to go get, which is anywhere from $350 million to $400 million and new orders to turn and book and ship. I think, in the last several months, with Gino's arrival and, I think, some rigorous processes and stronger linkage between finance and Mark Moon's organization, I feel more comfortable about some steps that have been taken. I think a great example of that is the cash generation of $741 million in Q4, which we've never had. And I will give a tip of the hat to Gino that dove into this. From a working capital standpoint, receivables, payables, it's the \"mud under your fingernails\" blocking and tackling that I'm very pleased with. So I think we're operationally more crisp. And the overall demand drivers of the business are strong, multiyear backlog is up. So those are the elements that underpin our guidance and my feeling of feeling more comfortable about this business.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","Okay. If I can ask a follow-up question to that. So it sounds like, from the final question here, in your commentary, the average age of your backlog is probably increasing substantially as the multiyear rollouts are, it actually sounds like they're, extending. Is that correct?","Gregory Q. Brown","That is correct, yes.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","Okay. Can you give us an idea of what the age of that backlog is, or the average age?","Gregory Q. Brown","I don't know the answer to that. I don't know.","Mark F. Moon","Keith, I would also say on Q1, the Q1 issue is really a North America issue. And when you think about what we've talked about with the federal government in North America and the way we bragged over the last several number of quarters about the performance of state and local in North America, 15% growth in '12, 9% growth this past year, it really is we're still very confident in that business. But the timing of that backlog in that business is down. The other thing, for the full year of Government, we do expect to return to growth in APME, which has been slower than expected but built great backlog. So that will be an upswing for this year. As well as Latin America, where we had a couple of projects slip from last year into this year, we believe that will also be stronger growth. So that will offset kind of the tough comparables that North America and EA will be fighting against this year.","Keith M. Housum - Northcoast Research","Okay, but for the first quarter, it really sounds sort of -- or what I'm hearing is, in the fourth quarter, your group and Gino's group really tightened up your review of that 80% visibility. And along with the combination of new orders that came in, it really caused you to reevaluate, I guess, your first -- or you guys have given quarterly guidance before, but that's just causing, I guess, the blip or the way the investors are seeing the first quarter, I should say.","Mark F. Moon","It is the late flow of the orders that we really didn't have visibility to till they came in, but again, the volume of that, it happens in the fourth quarter, our largest quarter ever, almost $3 billion of orders. And it is to -- speaking to Greg's comment on confidence, we have definitely instituted much more rigor in process for the bottoms-up buildup that gives us higher confidence both in the current quarter and for the guidance that we're giving for the full year.","Operator","I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any closing or additional remarks.","Shep Dunlap","Thanks.","I'd like to remind everyone that details outlining the highlighted items, our GAAP to non-GAAP P&L reconciliations and other financial information can be found on our website.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'll share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and outlook. So first, our strong Q2 results. We continue to build momentum in the second quarter, posting revenue growth of 5% and earnings per share growth of 9%. We grew in both Products and Services. We grew organically and we grew backlog, primarily driven by systems demand in North America.","Our land mobile radio business continues to lead the way as both public safety and commercial customers continue to demand always on private, secure, resilient and redundant mission-critical voice communications.","Second, our guidance; we're raising our full year guidance for both revenue and earnings per share based on our first half results and the ongoing demand visibility. We now expect full-year revenue growth of 3% to 4% with higher earnings per share, as we continue to see strong demand across the globe for land mobile radio products and services.","And finally, our investments in software, we announced our intent to acquire Airbus DS Communications, also known as PlantCML, which strengthens our suite of command center solutions for agencies of all sizes. Our command center software will improve the way our customers operate and provide critical intelligence across public safety workflows, from first responders in the field to operations staff at the command center.","I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on our Q2 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Greg. Q2 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 5% versus last year. GAAP operating earnings of $257 million, up 15% from last year. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up $4 million to $328 million. Operating margins were down 80 basis points to 21.9%. GAAP earnings per share were $0.78, up 28% from $0.61 in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.12, up 9% from $1.03 last year.","Ending backlog was $8.5 billion, up $265 million from last year. Products backlog was up $204 million and Services backlog was up $61 million. Additionally, aged backlog for the remainder of the year is higher than at this point last year. For the remainder of the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted.","Q2 Product sales were $848 million, up 6% from last year, driven primarily by the Americas. We saw growth in every region, reflecting significant demand for our P25 LMR systems. Q2 Products segment operating income was $193 million or 22.8% of sales, up 80 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and lower OpEx.","Gross margins were down, as expected, on higher system sales as well as inefficiencies associated with implementing our new ERP system during the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect gross margins to be comparable to last year. Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, up 15% or $204 million from last year, driven by North America. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Sequentially, Product backlog was up $1 million.","Turning to Services. Q2 Services revenue was $649 million, up 3%, including $20 million of currency headwinds associated with Airwave. Managed & Support Services grew 3% or 7% in constant currency. Services operating income was $135 million or 20.8% of sales, down from 23.5% of sales last year.","As expected, the operating margin decline was attributable to Airwave. We continue to expect full year Services gross margins to be comparable to last year. Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $61 million from last year, including approximately $500 million of Airwave backlog reduction. Sequentially, Services backlog was up $3 million.","Total OpEx was $367 million, up $4 million from the year-ago quarter. Excluding acquisitions, OpEx was down as expected versus last year. We continue to expect full-year OpEx to be down $10 million to $15 million inclusive of acquisitions. Other income and expense was $51 million, down from $57 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $51 million compared to $54 million a year ago. The Q2 effective tax rate was 31.6%.","Turning to cash flow. Q2 operating cash flow was $173 million, a decrease of $190 million from last year, primarily due to working capital timing associated with the ERP implementation. Free cash flow was $120 million, a decrease of $81 million from last year. On a year-to-date basis, both operating cash flow and free cash flow are up compared to the first half of 2016, and we continue to expect approximately $1.225 billion in operating cash flow for 2017.","We ended Q2 with cash of $805 million and net debt of $3.7 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $80 million of stock at an average price of $83.59 and we paid $77 million in dividends. We also announced our intent to acquire the Airbus PlantCML business.","Turning to our outlook; we expect Q3 sales to be up 3% to 4% versus last year and non-GAAP EPS between $1.36 and $1.41. As Greg mentioned, for the full year, we are raising both revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect full-year 2017 sales growth of 3% to 4% and non-GAAP EPS of $5.20 to $5.30. This assumes approximately 170 million fully diluted shares.","Looking at regional results; Americas revenue was up 7%, driven by strong demand for P25 Products and Services. Backlog was also up year-over-year and sequentially in Products and Services as customers continue to invest in LMR systems. EMEA was down 1% due to approximately $20 million of UK currency headwinds, while Products was up 12%. Asia Pac was up 2% on strong product performance driven by P25 demand in Australia. Services was down on lower systems integration, while Managed & Support Services was up.","I'd like to end with some notable highlights. During the quarter, we signed the FirstNet partnership agreement with AT&T, and we are encouraged that all states that have made a decision to-date have opted into the plan network. Additionally, during Q2, AT&T certified our LEX F10 FirstNet device, making us the only vendor with both a handheld device and a vehicular modem that is FirstNet ready.","Some key product wins include a $43 million award for P25 devices in a major U.S. city; a $40 million P25 system in Broward County, Florida; and a $10 million P25 devices order in Australia.","In Services, we secured a 10-year, $160 million contract for Managed & Support Services in Canada and a $90 million P25 system award covering three counties in Kentucky that includes a 10-year Managed & Support Services agreement.","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Gino. Let me just close with a few thoughts. First, with an excellent start to the year and continued demand visibility, we expect to grow in all regions. And we are well-positioned for strong full year performance that's now reflected in our higher revenue and EPS guidance.","Second, we continue to see customers invest in land mobile radio for the long term. North America Products revenue grew in 2015, again in 2016, and again in the first half of this year. Over that same time period, North America Products backlog has grown nearly $400 million. This solid ongoing demand speaks to the criticality and value of our LMR platform for mission-critical communications and confirms the coexistence of LMR and LTE over the long term.","And finally, with the planned acquisition of Airbus DS, we're building what we believe is the most comprehensive command center suite in the industry, covering the critical workflows of call taking, dispatch, records management and crime analytics.","As I look into the future of public safety, I'm pleased with our position and I'm pleased with our momentum. We're leveraging our LMR systems installed base, while simultaneously building incremental and complementary platforms for the command center and public safety LTE, which together, I think provide the foundation for continued growth, cash generation, earnings expansion and shareholder return over the long term.","And I'll now turn it back over to Chris.","Chris Kutsor - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thank you, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many others as possible. Operator, would you please remind callers on the line how to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Matthew Cabral with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thank you. I wanted to ask about software. Greg, you touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks. But clearly, this has been a big focus for you over the last 6 months or 12 months, organically and inorganically. So I'm just curious how you see the path forward for that business. And just thinking longer-term, how big you think it could become within the relative \u2013 within the revenue high over time?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Matt. So, we're obviously pleased, most recently, with the Airbus DS PlantCML applications. We like the size of the addressable market for the command center. And what's included in that, whether it's 911 call taking, CAD dispatch, real-time analytics, records management, and as you pointed out, we have been steady \u2013 had a steady drumbeat of inorganic acquisitions to build out that suite.","I think as we continue to make progress for the rest of this year and into next year, we'll complete what I think is the most comprehensive suite in the industry. We had Andrew Sinclair join the firm about four months ago. We feel good about his capabilities, his expertise and what he'll build and bring to us over time.","I think that the most likely thing, Matt, we'll do is progress through the end of this year and probably do a pretty comprehensive review of the software business at our financial analyst meeting, which we anticipate will be Q1 of next year.","Taking a step back, though, as we emphasize both software and management support services and what that could mean to us from a recurring revenue stream, just this past quarter in Q2, 29% of our overall revenue was recurring, which is a favorable trend, and we feel good about our ability to build on it.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then on FirstNet, so it's been four months now since the contract was awarded and several states have opted in early. So just wondering if you can provide an update on how you see the opportunity both for next year and just thinking about a little bit longer term as well.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes, feel good about the relationship with AT&T. We're pleased, as Gino mentioned in his remarks that all states have opted in. By the way, Michigan opted in just an hour ago, I think, representing the 9th state and 10th, including the U.S. Virgin Islands overall. So we have an agreement signed that was new since the last earnings call with AT&T. I think we can monetize this relationship in software and mobile apps, services interoperability between LTE and LMR, which I mentioned I think will coexist over the long term, as well as devices.","We view the FirstNet opportunity as incremental. We don't count on any revenue this year. I mentioned a couple of months ago an estimate of about $40 million to $60 million for next year. I think for now, that's fine. We'll update you by the end of the year. But again, while states are opting in, there's a long way to go between now and the end of the year. And the ultimate success of FirstNet will depend on the actual penetration or loading of subscribers that switch from an existing wireless carrier over to FirstNet. And time will tell. But we feel very good about our portfolio and uniqueness in the space and the agreement with AT&T.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Just two, if I could here, follow on the FirstNet, Greg. Could you talk a little bit about when you can start engaging customers, so particularly for services or products that might not be a part of the AT&T deal? So in other words, when states come in, can you guys go see them and start the process on apps or software or integrated products or devices?","And then, secondly, you talked a number of times about the LMR strength. Can you just give us a little flavor as to what you think is behind this? Is it capacity? Is it upgrades for new features? What do you think is driving it and how sustainable do you feel it's going to be?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Well, taking the second part first, we feel pretty good about the demand for land mobile radio. And obviously, it's pretty strong this quarter. We had an exceptionally strong Q4 of last year with Products revenue growing 9%. But as I mentioned, North America, which is two-thirds of the company's revenue, the demand has been pretty steady. 2015, 2016, the first half of this year, Product backlog, which is a reasonable indicator for visibility going forward, up about $400 million around \u2013 from a North America perspective over the same 10 quarters and the thing that I'm particularly pleased about in Q2 is the systems demand.","So when these land mobile radio platforms or systems go in, they're going in for the long term, which you will then load with subscriber devices, which you'll then add to it with agencies and secondary and tertiary users and they typically go in with 10-year and 15-year maintenance agreements. So I think the demand has been pretty steady. I think also part of it is Molloy's team has been pretty consistent in execution.","Latin America has gone from a negative to a positive and the team down there has done a very nice job. In EMEA, under new leadership in Mark Schmidl doing a very good job, new leadership in the channel organization, changes we've made, better execution. So I think it's a combination of demand being steady and strong around the globe, led by North America from a system standpoint and strong execution from the worldwide sales team.","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","And Tim, this is Bruce Brda, maybe on your first question with respect to timing of FirstNet opportunity. We are today beginning to have discussions with customers on readying their LMR networks for LMR-LTE interoperability. So that is an opportunity we're pursuing today.","The application sales and device sales will obviously follow subscribers actually opting in, subscribing to the network and then buying devices and applications to use on the network. So in the short term or near term, it's interoperability between LMR and LTE. And then the longer term, which will follow subscriber loading, would be applications and devices.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tavis McCourt with Raymond James.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First, Gino, I may have missed it in the press release, but can you repeat what the gross margin was in Services and Products for this quarter? And then, Greg, for you; just in terms of modeling for the rest of the year and into next year.","So the two outstanding acquisitions that haven't closed yet are Kodiak and Plant. I want to make sure I'm not missing any others. Is there any way to kind of size those financially for us and kind of timing on when they close? And then as a follow-up, maybe if you could give us a sense of how you view the market opportunity for 911 and command center software? Thanks.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","A couple of things. PlantCML, the Airbus acquisition, we expect to close at the end of the year. So there's nothing in 2017. Kodiak will not close yet and not in our guidance. It's pretty insignificant to the balance of 2017. It's not material and won't move it much.","In terms of PlantCML, what I would point to is the revenue for 2016 was a little bit more than $100 million. So that's a reasonable reference point as you incorporate that into your thinking. Overall, again, to an earlier question I had, we like this space a lot. I mean, we leverage the land mobile radio systems installed base we have. But we're also building a pretty significant software platform, which involves a variety of acquisitions and at the moment, point solutions.","I think over time, we can platform that business, integrate the software applications into a more comprehensive suite led by Andrew Sinclair. And I think the addressable market for the command center is a sizable one for us to pursue. So it makes sense for us to build that platform along with the public safety LTE platform as well.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","And Tavis, this is Gino. With respect to gross margins, in the release, we don't have the gross margin by segment. But as expected and recall during our last call, the guidance, our expectation was for gross margin to be down, driven primarily by a few things. One was Airwave FX and the purchase accounting adjustment, catch-up adjustment year-to-date in 2016. That would be obviously reflected in the Services gross margin, as well as a shift to systems in North America. Greg mentioned and I mentioned in prepared remarks, the strength of systems in North America, as well as some ERP-related \u2013 ERP implementation-related cost in Q2. So Q2 margin down approximately 160 basis points, spread across really those three issues.","And I should say, as I said in the prepared remarks, our expectation is that gross margin in both Services and Products we expect to be comparable for the full year. And through the first half, margins are comparable despite the Airwave FX headwind and purchase accounting adjustment. Margins through the first half are comparable.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just you mentioning a few moments ago, the ERP system, I guess, Gino, is there an update on the ERP system? And I guess, talk a little bit about the working capital impact from the ERP system. Is everything full steam ahead as of right now?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes. So we cut over in April and we experienced some typical issues, we plan for them. Inventory, specifically inventory, ended higher and a little bit in receivables. The inventory \u2013 the ending inventory was driven by some difficulties in our planning module in the ERP implementation system. And from a receivables perspective, we had some invoices that went out later and were outside of the terms and moved into Q3.","We expect the implementation to be largely complete by the end of Q3. And the implications are contemplated in our outlook. As I said in my prepared remarks, our expectation remains unchanged for operating cash flow for the full year.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. Thanks. And then just a little bit of color, if I could, on the comments you guys made regarding the $40 million to $60 million will be recognized first that perhaps next year, and I realize that number is a little bit soft there. But can you give us a little bit of color on what would that revenue represent? Is it a matter of just doing some general software work, or is it a per-user recognition you'll be recognizing there?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I think it represents, at this point, an estimate for the composite total revenue. It could, to your point, include software and mobile applications. It could include Services activation. It could include the deployment of software we've developed, which interoperates and links, land mobile radio P25 with LTE networks. And of course, it could include a mix of devices, not just handhelds, but vehicular modems. So it's all of the above. It's a best guess, by the way. Most important of that is less the composition of how it comes in by product or software bucket but it assumes a certain loading level, a certain penetration level that we think is reasonable. But we'll have a better view of it in Q1.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stanley Kovler with Citi Research.","Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to see if you could contrast your commentary around the strength on the system side of your North America business with some press or FCC data that recently came out suggesting that the spectrum LMR licensing activity is quite low. And I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes, Stan. No, as I mentioned, I think the demand \u2013 I'm very pleased with our demand, both as represented in revenue and backlog, led by North America and over the past several quarters. I saw the note that you referenced around land mobile radio licensing decline, I think there's a few things to note from a clarification standpoint.","I'm not surprised by it at all, but at the same token, number one, a large number of customers are converting to P25 TDMA. That has a 2-to-1 spectral efficiency. So you'll literally need half the license than you previously would need as you move to upgrade to a more efficient P25 TDMA deployment.","In addition to that, number two, we're seeing more customers increase state-wide and region-wide deployments, taking advantage of the 700 megahertz frequency. The impact is the same. I mean, demand, if anything, continues to go up for LMR. But the actual system or license, spectrum licenses could decline because the systems are spread over new bands and they're much more spectrally efficient.","So \u2013 and the last thing I'd mention is I know that that referenced a spike period of several years ago associated with narrowband. So while I think it's interesting, I do not think it's a good proxy or a correlation to use to judge the demand for our land mobile radio business, in particular, P25, because all systems are green and over a sustainable period of time and through the second half of this year.","Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's great. Thanks for the color. And my follow-up is just more around the transition, longer-term from LMR to LTE. It sounds like there could be some push-to-talk transition discussions around March 2019. And in the similar vein to what happened in the UK with the timeline pushing back on the transition there, could we see some of that in the U.S. as well as people begin into dig into when the transition or the cutoff could happen?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Well, I think there's a couple of things to note. There's a difference between push-to-talk over cellular and mission-critical push-to-talk over cellular. I think the demand that we're seeing for land mobile radio systems and product backlog, along with these customers buying brand-new systems with 10-year and 15-year maintenance, speaks to what they think firsthand, North America-led, U.S.-led on the criticality, durability and longevity of land mobile radio here.","I think that you'll read and hear things about other push-to-talk solutions. The confusing thing is some people call it mission-critical push-to-talk, whether they reference it in 3GPP release 13 or 14 or now they're talking about release 15. But I don't think it changes what we're seeing, which is continued strong demand for P25 systems, U.S. led.","The last thing I'd mentioned is, we now have won five of the largest public safety LTE awards in the world, Los Angeles, FirstNet as a subcontractor to AT&T, the UK Home Office in the form of ESN; and two countries in the Middle East. And what we see in all of those cases, five out of five is continued strong investment, either upgrading or in some cases, brand-new land mobile radio, which speaks to the coexistence and the expectation by our customers that public safety LTE will be data focused and video focused, while mission-critical voice will continue to be provisioned over P25.","Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to ask about Managed Services and just what the drivers there were. We saw some acceleration there. I know you called out these two deals. Is that the main reason that, that was up? Or are there other things going on there? Could you just give us a little more detail?","And then, I guess, I wanted to come back to this FirstNet thing. We understand that you have unique relationships with all of these police offices and fire stations and so on, and those are not easy relationships to manage. And so you seem like you're in a pretty unique distribution position there and yet you've been repeatedly asked by us and others about whether you would have some kind of a commission generating distribution opportunity there and you keep sidestepping that question. I'm just wondering, is there sensitivity around that issue, or is it something that's not sorted out yet and there is an opportunity, but we just don't know whether it's going to develop? Or can you just give us a little bit more color on what might be going on with that specific issue? Thanks.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Let's take the second one first. I'm not sure what you're referencing when you say sidestepping. We have agreements with AT&T, both on the product side and on the distribution side. They both have been signed, and we're pleased with the relationship. And we have a shoulder-to-shoulder relationship with AT&T. We feel very good about to pursue FirstNet opportunities. You're right that we have, I think, unparalleled direct sales coverage on these public safety agencies throughout the United States. I think that's a large part of why AT&T was interested in partnering with us, not just the technology and the innovation that Motorola Solutions brings, but the go-to-market expertise and the deep domain expertise and relationships that we've cultivated over the last several decades.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I guess, let me just clarify that. I guess, maybe that's too harsh a term. But it's the economics of that relationship that we still don't really understand. It feels to us like that ought to be the biggest opportunity for you guys financially. And we don't \u2013 but, yes, from your commentary, it's not super clear to us, if that really is the case. I mean maybe we just have the wrong end of the stick on that perception. So that's what's driving that question.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes, I see what you're saying. Well, I think a couple of things. The point of clarification, we're trying to provide you to kind of chalk the field is the $40 million to $60 million for next year. Going beyond that, I think isn't worthwhile because we have to see the traction, penetration and subscriber loading. We don't disaggregate the detail, to your point, around how we monetize software, mobile apps, services, interoperability, what we charge for competitive reasons. And a disclosure standpoint, we want to maintain our edge in what we provide and not disclose what we don't need to. But we'll competitively bid and enthusiastically go head-to-head against anybody we need to.","Well, I'm not trying to hide anything. I'm just suggesting that we're trying to give you the best estimate around revenue in the $40 million to $60 million without taking you through the disaggregation of each bucket, which I don't think is as meaningful. But again, I'd point to you the most important is actually the penetration and subscriber loading. And while nine states have opted in, we're waiting on 41 others. So there's still, I think, a lot of wood to chop between now and the end of the year. And I think we'll have perhaps more layers of clarity that you may like as we get into the beginning of next year.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then maybe a little more color on the Managed Services, if you have it?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes. Go ahead, Gino.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure. Rod, this is Gino. Managed & Support Services have been growing in mid-single-digits for the past eight or nine quarters. It was purposeful. The design of \u2013 including the design of products and really, what's driving that, the underlying driver is, the technology becomes more and more complicated. It becomes more and more difficult for our customers to manage their own systems, and many of them look for us to manage the systems for them. So when we talk about the TAM around Managed & Support Services, what we're referring to is managing the systems that we have deployed.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","The other nice thing about Managed & Support Services is on a constant-currency basis, it grew 7% in Q2. So we continue to believe that Managed & Support Services will grow at a faster rate than Product. And I think Kelly, Mark and his team are doing a nice job on that front.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Okay. Thanks guys.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. I joined the call late so maybe this has kind of asked. But it's more \u2013 a question for Greg on the sustainability of growth from here. And I just think about a few factors, I don't think your comp is necessarily that high and there were a number of \u2013 I'm talking about organic growth. And there your comps aren't necessarily that hard and you had a number of one-time issues and contracts rolling off last year that have now anniversaried. You've got decent backlog, you've got the public safety LTE. What's your confidence now, Greg, of just landing in that kind of lower single-digit revenue growth rate very consistently at least for the foreseeable future, as in, I'm not talking just Q3, but into 2017 and 2018, perhaps?","And then the second question is, this was a long time ago. It may not be relevant anymore. But you once I think said that once public safety LTE hit, you might be a mid to high single-digit revenue growth company. Is that still something you think? I think I know a lot has changed since that was initially said. Is that something you think about on a long-term basis or should we not think about that for some reason?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yeah, I think a couple of things. Let's take the second one first. We talked about low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth all in over the long term. You're right as these incremental opportunities, whether it be public safety LTE or public safety LTE and command center software, I think as they get more traction and land mobile radio continues to be pretty solid and predictable, we move \u2013 yes, we have the opportunity to move more toward the right goalpost in that regard.","How do I feel about growth overall? I feel pretty good about it referenced in the fact that we're taking the full year up to 3% to 4%. I feel good about it because it's underpinned by higher aged backlog. I feel good about it when I look at the desegregation of the segments and some of the key metrics we look at. I feel good about organic growth on a constant-currency basis in Q2 being 4%. And we're not going to guide for 2018 yet. But again, I think the momentum we have here, as we finish the second half of the year, I feel good about our position. And I feel very good about our momentum, Kulbinder.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then just maybe one more, just one follow-up to that.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Given the growth is happening \u2013 and we all waited a long time for that. So in terms of \u2013 on the operating cost side, you did just a very good job over the years of incrementally shaving off some OpEx. Is that still possible from the basis that we're at like \u2013 I'm not talking just near-term, I'm talking about \u2013 or is they need to maybe invest in the business to pursue some more of these initiatives? Can OpEx be held flat in like a 3%, 4% top line environment or is that changing in any way?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Well, we're doing both. We're cutting expense and simultaneously investing, I think, where we need to. So I think that's proved to be very effective, reference the operating leverage that you have seen recently. And then, quite frankly, I think we continue to expect, OpEx will be down $10 million to $15 million this year. That includes all of the acquisitions. If we take a look at 2018, while we're not going to get into the specifics, I would expect OpEx, excluding acquisitions, to continue to be down slightly on the base businesses.","So I think the team continues to do things on the OpEx side and on the efficiency side, which avail themselves for us to take advantage of. By the way, we talked about the ERP implementation that we cut over in April. That would be on phase I completed here in Q3. Eventually, as we get more conversion and completion of that system, there's requisite efficiencies and IT costs and business process efficiencies that I think could be reflected over the longer term. That's in part why we invested in the ERP. So net-net, we will be down $10 million to $15 million this year, all in. And I think that operating leverage is expected to improve again in 2018.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Kulbinder, this is Gino. Just a couple of comments. First comment being $700 million reduction in OpEx is a little bit more than incremental. That's the way as you described it. Greg mentioned, OpEx and OpEx associated with acquisitions. For the full year in 2017, the acquisition OpEx number is $45 million. Inclusive of that $45 million, our expectation is to be down $10 million to $15 million.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies.","Kyle McNealy - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. This is Kyle here for George. Thanks for taking the question. Wondering if you can provide an update on your thoughts around Airwave and ESN in the UK over the longer term? I believe the idea was floated out to use LTE for general mission-critical communications purposes and potentially use TETRA for direct mode use cases. Wondering how that changes your view on the total opportunity in the UK over the longer term. And once the ESN gets built out and I understand that it's going to be some time until that project kind of comes to fruition. So I'd like to get your thoughts on that. Thanks.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes, on Airwave, we're expecting \u2013 things are going well, as expected, continue to progress. And for the full year in 2017, we're expecting Airwave revenue to be approximately $490 million. On ESN, we continue to work closely with the UK Home Office. It's a complex project. We're working closely with EE as well, the wireless carrier provider. We're working to deploy and test the software deliverables on our end. The project has gone through some changes. It's currently slated, as stated by the customer, to start mid-2018. But we have work to do on our end and we're staying very close to both EE and Home Office.","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","And Kyle, this is Bruce Brda. With respect to direct mode, I think you're aware, LTE currently doesn't have a viable solution for direct mode. The UK Home Office has selected to go down a path of really two technologies, LTE for trunked or group communication, and then TETRA as a direct mode solution, so two technologies, two devices. We will compete for the direct mode TETRA device business at the right point in time. That opportunity hasn't surfaced yet, though.","Kyle McNealy - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Spinola with Wells Fargo.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Gino, could you possibly take a shot at giving us a sense of what the organic growth is implied in your Q3 guide for the business?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","For Q3, Andrew?","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Or for the full year?","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","For Q3.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Go ahead.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","What I was going to say is, I am looking at the model and you've got sort of flat currency in Airwave so that should be kind of neutral in Q3 and you've got about $0.5 billion of acquisitions in the last four quarters and a much stronger euro heading into Q3. So I'm wondering if your guidance for Q3 embeds organic growth for the core business or not.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","So Andrew, we'll start with the year. Certainly, for the full year, our expectation is for growth and growth in both Products and Services and organic growth. In Q3, as you said, Airwave is not the headwind that we had in Q2. But our expectation in Q3 is to grow Products and Services and grow organically as well.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","If I could just ask a follow-up on that.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Sure.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","You spent about \u2013 you spent almost $0.5 billion in the last four quarters on acquisitions. The middle point of your range is 3.5% growth, which is $55 million of incremental revenue. I'm assuming that $0.5 billion got you more than $55 million. You've got a stronger euro. So how is it that you're growing organically?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","On 3% to 4% for the full year?","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","For Q3.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","I'm not sure. Maybe we'll go through the model and your math, Andrew. I'm not sure...","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, if the full year is easier, do you have a sense of what the acquisitions are adding to 2017?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes, for revenue amount...","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","...in 2017? About $50 million, $50 million to $60 million for the full year.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. A question for you, Greg, you mentioned, I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, you said before that all five of the LTE contracts that you've won, you've seen investments in the LMR networks at the same time. Did I hear that correctly?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Right. We continue to see those five continue to invest in LMR.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","What \u2013 since you own the Airwave network, what investments are you making in that network?","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Well, I mean, they continue to use it. They continue to upgrade system software releases. They continue to add devices and interoperability between fire and police.","Bruce Brda - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes, this is Bruce. A key add that they are making now is the ability to interoperate between LTE and TETRA. That's an enhancement that's being made at this point in time.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start; if you could talk a little bit about the overall portfolio of software services you have available today in public safety LTE. How big would you say the portfolio is? What type of assets do you have versus what needs to be developed? And any implications on kind of investment levels over \u2013 whatever in the next 12 months or 18 months, and then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Yes. So if you think about the command center software assets, we have our high end PremierOne product in records management complemented by Spillman, an acquisition we made last year. For real-time intelligence and analytics, we have Public Engines, a small acquisition, more nascent, but something that begins to give us traction on the analytic side. For CAD dispatch and voice, we also have our PremierOne CAD system at the high-end complemented by Spillman as well and a voice console. And for next-generation 911 call taking, we've got Emergency CallWorks for Tier 2 and tier 3 and now, the Airbus VESTA suite on the high end.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. The last item I had was, there seems to be a little bit of discussion out there about federal budgets specific to next year. I know that's a small percentage of the overall business. But there does seem to be some questions about the percentage of state, local and municipal funding that does come from federal grants. So I'm curious if you have any thoughts about what the environment could look like as you get into next year given some of the uncertainty And if you've had any of those discussions with customers, how they may be thinking about it? Thanks.","John P. Molloy - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Hey, Ben, it's Jack. So, first of all, just to kind of level set. The federal government business this year will be approximately $500 million, which was comparable to our 2016, which was up double digits. When you look at 2018, obviously, we're under a CR. But when you look at the supplemental budgets, both border patrol, customs and border patrol and DoD, are all in for incremental funding, which is good for us. I think you saw the recent announcement that we had a $461 million part of a multivendor award in the DoD for the army. And I think so when you think about that, it does a couple of things. It tells you there's continued and sustained interest in P25.","And the second thing is just due to our sales coverage in the federal market is in these multi-vendor environments we perform very well. So we think about next year in the federal government, the budgets look to be favorable, the contractual mechanisms are favorable and we think we cover the market really well in Fed. So we're actually optimistic.","Ben J. Bollin - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you.","Gregory Q. Brown - Motorola Solutions, Inc.","Before \u2013 that was the last question. Just for clarity, Andrew, on your question, the approximately $50 million of growth in Q3, half of it is the result of the acquisition of Spillman and Interexport, the other half is core. Remember, Plant and Kodiak are not closed yet. They are not in that number.","Operator","Thank you, gentlemen. It appears we have no further questions at this time.

I'd like to share a few thoughts about the overall business before Gino takes us to the result and the outlook. First Q4 was outstanding quarter, capping a very strong year. ","We grew Q4 revenue 4% driving higher earnings and cash flow on a continued strength of our Land Mobile Radio solutions lead by North America. We see continued demand across both our government and commercial customers around the world reflected in our recent results and our record backlog.","Second, 2017 was a record year for sale operating earnings, cash flow and backlog, demonstrating the earnings power of our Land Mobile Radio platforms. In addition to growing the full year revenue 6% with growth in every region, we grew operating earnings 9% through EPS 11% and we grew operating cash flow 16%. ","Finally, I'm very pleased with our competitive position moving forward, I expect our LMR platform business to provide continued growth while also driving additional manage services expansion and further differentiating our command center software strategy. ","So now I'd like to turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q4 results and outlook before returning to provide some final thoughts.","Gino Bonanotte","Thank you, Greg. Q4 results include revenue of $2 billion, up 4% from last year, and organic revenue up 2%. ","GAAP operating earnings were $511 million, up $108 million from last year, non-GAAP operating earnings were $576 million, up $35 million or 6% from the year ago quarter. And operating margins were 29.4% of sales, up 70 basis points from last year. ","GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $3.56, up compared to earnings of the $43 in the year ago quarter. The loss reflects one-time charges of $874 million related to recent U.S. tax reform. The charges are primarily two items $471 million related to the valuation allowance and foreign tax credits and 366 million related to the re-measurement of U.S. differed tax assets at a lower rate.

In total our share repurchase program has retired 53% of our shares at an average cost of $58.59. ","Finally, in Q1 of 2018, we're planning a debt funded $500 million pension contribution that takes advantage of the recent tax legislation. This funding pushes and further cash contributions to our U.S. pension plan until minimally 2024 likely beyond, in addition this plant contribution grow the 2017 cash deduction at 35% versus 21% providing an NPV of approximately $60 million. ","Turning to our outlook, we expect Q1 revenue growth of approximately 7% and organic growth 5% including approximately $40 million from currency tailwinds.

The outlook does not including the pending Airbus PlantCML or Avigilon acquisitions. Airbus PlantCML is expected to close in Q1 and Avigilon is expected to close in Q2. ","Full-year operating expenses are expected to be down again by approximately $20 million, from 2917 inclusive of $20 million of OpEx from completed acquisitions and inclusive of $30 million in higher OpEx from currency headwinds. ","We expect the full-year 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 25% and our cash tax rate to remain at approximately 15% for 2018 and 2019. 2018 operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion excluding the $500 million debt funded pension contribution previously mentioned. ","Looking at regional results; Americas grew 60% in Q4 and 70% for the full year. This broad base growth was driven by systems multiyear management support services and commercial products. Backlog is up $915 million from last year with double-digit growth in both products and services year-over-year as customers continue to invest in there LMR solutions. ","The EMEA declined 2% in Q4 on the completion of a large LTE implementation in the prior year. For 2017 EMEA was up 5% and growth in products and services and backlog is up $131 million versus last year. ","Asia Pac grew 1% for the quarter and 1% for the year driven by growth in both products and services. Backlog is up about $195 million, primarily on services growth. ","I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. First, in our products segments during Q4, we were awarded a $290 million contract for an LMR system in a Middle Eastern country that recently deployed a private public safety LTE system. This significant investment in LMR is the latest example of customers further validating that LTE and LMR are complementary technologies. ","We also won several large LMR deals in North America during the quarter, including a $76 million P25 order for the city of Dallas, a $53 million P25 order for the city of Los Angeles, and a $39 million P25 order for the city of Toronto. ","In our services segment, we continue to see demand by our customers for multi-year support contracts for their LMR systems. A few notable Q4 awards include a $197 million seven-year managed services contract extension for the Melbourne Metropolitan Radio Network in Australia. A $40 million five-year managed services contract in Victoria, Australia, and an $18 million seven-year managed services contract with Dow Chemical. ","I'd also like to mention a few full year operating highlights. During 2017, we launched 85 new products while reducing our device use by 55%. We also launched new or expanded services offerings across devices, commercial infrastructure and LTE. ","We completed the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, adding a carrier integrated cellular push to talk solution for mobile operators around the world. We signed the FirstNet partnership agreement with AT&T to provide software applications, devices, and services for public safety customers on the first network. ","And finally, we completed the acquisition of Interexport a provider of managed services for communication systems to public safety and commercial users in Chile. ","I'll now like to turn the call back over to Greg.","Gregory Brown","Thanks Gino and let me just close with a few thoughts. First, I'm very, very proud of the 2017 results we posted as a direct result of our employees' dedication and focus and efforts in delivering unmatched technology and unmatched service to our global customers, many of whom put their lives on the line every single day. ","Second, I'm especially pleased with our momentum moving forward. Our record backlog reflects the continued strong demand for LMR led by North America, and we're making continued progress in growing our software and services business as well. ","And finally, we announced today a definitive agreement to acquire Avigilon a leader in advanced video surveillance and analytics, adding Avigilon end to end video capabilities and analytics for our commercial and public safety customers, provides not only another key workflow stream to our solutions offering, but also significantly expands the total addressable market that we serve today, paving the way for additional future growth. The management team here remains acutely focused on continuing to grow this firm profitably and for the long-term. ","And now I'll turn it back over to Chris. ","Chris Kutsor","Thanks Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many others as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers how to ask a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from George Notter with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","George Notter","I guess I was curious about the bigger spending environment around public safety LMR. I guess I'm thinking more about the United States, it seems like state and local tax receipt has to be very, very strong I assume that the content winds for your business. ","I want to ask about federal tax receipts also, we got tax reform, I guess I am imagining the tax receipt to be lower going forward. But can you just talk about the environment and how exchanging with tax reform for your LMR business. Thanks. ","Jack Molloy","Hi George its Jack, so I guess first of all from a state and local perspective, you're spot on. I think what you\u2019re seeing are reference the fact that North America grew in 2015, 2016 and 2017 both in terms of revenue and backlog. I think that\u2019s testament to the strength of the demand drivers in public safety and state local. ","From a federal prospective, similar story, we had a great year in 2016 and frankly we beat that slightly in 2017, the demand drivers right now in the federal government are really too fold. We have a defense team, we're seeing continued spending in the defense around military base communications that\u2019s been strong story and then we look at domestically here from a law enforcement and border, petrol prospective again the demand and lot of what the trump administration doing in terms of planning, those things have looked to be beneficial for us as well, we enter 2018 frankly in federal in a better backlog position that we did in 2017. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Timothy Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Timothy Long ","First on, Greg if you could touch on FirstNet, I think last time you were talking 40 million to 60 million of revenues this year, obviously those states opted in and AT&T seems to be talking pretty aggressively about deployment. So just talk to us a little bit about what are the changes over the last few months have meant as far as your outlook for that business for the year.","And then secondly may be for Gino, just looking at the full year guidance seems to imply gross margin down a little bit this year, could you just talk a little bit about the gross margin outlook and what might be potentially pushing that lower. Thank you. ","Gregory Brown","So, thanks for the questions, in terms of FirstNet, our role hasn\u2019t change, we're still going to provide machine critical software applications and LMR and operability and services but to your point right now the starter pistol's been fired and it's all about subscriber load, so we're pleased that all 56 states and territories opted in but now its game on. ","Our current planning actually for this year on FirstNet revenues are about 20 million to 40 million, I wouldn\u2019t over interpretive one way or the other fact I hope is above but just from a prudent planning standpoint, I wanted to set those goal posts as more reflective of where we're today, we just don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know. The partnership with AT&T continues to work well and go well, but that's our expectation from a FirstNet standpoint at this point in time. ","Gino Bonanotte","Hey Kevin its Gino. On gross margins, gross margins are expectation of 2018, gross margins are flat comparable to 2017 and in 2017 we had comparable gross margins in both the product and services segment versus the prior year and the margin reduction for MSI in total was simply a result of the mix to services and we talked about the gross margin profile in services, which includes systems integration to be slightly less than product. So, we see 2018 margins comparable to 2017. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Vijay Bhagavath","Hi Greg, Gino. So, my question is around you know Greg, when you talk to your top customers and your sales teams, what are they telling you in terms of spending intentions that unified state local agencies for this year versus last year and then what priorities are your customers assigning to software command control versus devices and networks and then quickly, you know, these events this year, like the Olympics, the World Cup soccer, would these be incremental opportunities for you to public safety? Thanks ","Gregory Brown","Just on the third point, I think that the opportunities and the events that you outlined are incorporated already into our guidance for fiscal 2018. One of the things we referenced last time that with the natural disasters, the hurricanes, the fires in California, I also think continually reinforce and remind the absolute always on reliable criticality without substitution of land mobile radio systems. But you know, Jack mentioned a little bit about state and local demand and federal demand just a few minutes ago and I think we see it continue to be strong. And Bruce on the command center, maybe you want to mention a few things on that front. ","Gino Bonanotte","Sure, thanks Vijay. If you think about the command center software applications, 911 cad, records, dispatch and then analytics around it. We are currently, we built up that portfolio through acquisition or organically and we're really going through the hard work now of integrating that into a single suite. ","We have seen very good progress on cross sell activities. I'll, I'll note between Spillman and ECW as an example, they serve the same size, tier two, tier three marketplace. We've seen great progress on cross sell and we're beginning to see early suite sale, accomplishments as well. So, we're really pleased with the progress that we're making more work to do, but so far, it's really working well. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Keith Housum ","Good afternoon guys, thanks for taking my questions. Mind if I drill down more into the acquisition you guys announced today with Avigilon, in terms of like the current customer overlap that you guys had together and it is just taking you to new markets and what do you guys need to make this acquisition versus you know, your current technology. So, can you just provide some more color on those lines, that would be great.","Gregory Brown","Sure Keith. So, taking a step back, the strategic rationale on this is and we're pretty enthusiastic is. First of all, video surveillance and analytics is growing, it's growing rapidly. ","Second, the total addressable market is in well in excess of 10 or 11 billion and then some. ","And third, video continues to be a growing proponent, a growing requirement of public safety customers and critical infrastructure customers that want a solution and would like Motorola to provide ","The thing that is especially attractive to me is this is not a commodity business, as you've seen the other actions that we've taken with the portfolio over time, I'm not interested in commodity businesses, I'm not interested in commodity margins, I like the market leader with an end to end platform orientation and we believe this end to end video surveillance, suites of analytic, video management and video storage is particularly strong. Now we're as Gino said earlier its GPS neutral, and it's not included in our 2018 guidance but Avigilon is a public company on a Canadian Exchange and you can go back and look at their revenue growth and the kind of execution they had. ","The other thing I would say is there is a lot of point solutions in this business, we\u2019re in end to end platform choice, and we believe we have this distinct advantage where we will have when we close this acquisition around faster deployment than comparative products. ","And the things especially I love is the channel synergies. So this can fit very neatly and nicely and we can take this portfolio into global public safety because they have been enterprise centric today largely, we can take it into U.S. military, we can take it into U.S. federal, we can take it into our large direct sales force that serve enterprises in the commercial markets, so it's got very attractive channel synergies and lastly quite frankly much like mission critical communications, I think there is a growing aversion to having Chinese provider to critical video surveillance and security and I think that trend will lend itself well to us as well. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Stanley Kovler with Citi Research. Please go ahead. ","Stanley Kovler","Just wanted to ask you guys about just the trends in the backlog and how we should think about conversions even adding a lot to the backlog recently, can you help us understand what the aging is then is and how that will hit the services line on the revenue side going forward, and then I have a follow up. ","Gino Bonanotte","Okay great Stanley this is Gino, so the backlog increased, let's first start with 2018 aging entering into 2018, we're better aged than we were a year ago 12 months ago, the duration I think you\u2019re getting at to the duration of backlog. The duration on the products backlog hasn\u2019t changed, I think you can go back and track that duration to revenue and it's been consistent for the past several years. ","On the services side the duration is a little bit longer as we continue to sign multi-year agreements, I referenced seven and five-year agreements in some cases, 15 years services agreement and the duration clearly of that backlog is a bit longer. ","Stanley Kovler","And as a follow up I just wanted to ask you on the Avigilon acquisition, looking back at their margin structure especially the operating margins they have, much faster revenue growth but lower margins. How should we think about folding that business into your model? Is the revenue growing essentially offsetting margin from gross profit dollar contribution standpoint or their OpEx synergies as well? Thank you. ","Gregory Brown","So, I think it's too early to comment on, on how to think about it from a model perspective. We will update you after the close. By the way, we expect to run this business self-contained as a separate subsidiary inside of Motorola solutions. So, we're very pleased with the structure of the organization, the talent quality, the patent portfolio, the distribution channels and we want to be very mindful that I think appropriately managed going forward this will continue on a very successful track. The data demonstrated of execution. I think this is about building an end to end platform, adding another leg to the school for public safety, over existing distribution channels and brand by Motorola Solutions and giving them a more skill to accelerate their growth. ","Stanley Kovler","Got It. Thank you. That's helpful. ","Gino Bonanotte","This is Gino. I'll just reiterate something Greg said a few minutes ago. The expectation of Avigilon from an NPS perspective in 2018 would be a push. It is a push as well for the PlantCML business, we expect both Plant and Avigilon to be accretive 2019 and beyond. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew DeGasperi with Macquarie. Please go ahead. ","Andrew DeGasperi","Thank you. First Greg, maybe, could you comment on ESN, we've been hearing there's some, additional delays in building out in rural areas. And then Gino, maybe Avigilon quickly I noticed that the breakdown of revenues geographically seems to be showing a slowdown in the US, but growing very fast in Europe, in Asia, do you see the opportunity essentially a turnaround in the US business while also benefiting from those other tailwinds? Thanks.","Gregory Brown","I don't really have any current update at this point in time. I'll just simply say we've worked really closely with the UK Home Office, particularly in Q4 as they go through some of their planning and regeneration of timeline. I think that quite frankly, I thought the relationship has strengthened in the last several months. I was out in London, either late November and December, we've had dedicated teams working very closely together and I think it'd be more appropriate for them, so let them announce any kind of changes to their schedule. What I would tell you is that we are not planning on in our 2018 guidance any material revenue contribution from ESM.","Gino Bonanotte","And Andrew, this is Gino, on growth and we will clearly give you more details at the TAM and certainly after close, but the only thing I\u2019d point you to is, their compounded annual growth rate of 37%. Greg mentioned the TAM 37% from 2012 through 2016. Greg mentioned the TAM, you can see the revenue number. So aside from just ups and downs, we absolutely see a continued growth in the Americas and I think in conjunction with our distribution organization, we see growth in revenue synergies, frankly in the rest of the world. We're very excited about the acquisition. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. ","Paul Silverstein","Thanks very much, I appreciate it. Greg if you can you remind us prior to the 100 plus million a quarter community and you're going to get some Avigilon, I trust video today is a fairly small -, but surveillance and analytics in total, what is the organic revenue to that. ","Gregory Brown","I think the proxy and what we said from a software perspective, command prospective, what we said publicly is approximately $300 million, now I wouldn\u2019t disaggregated further to video that is the total number for the software business, but that\u2019s currently where we are from a software prospective at least in the command center. We have really the only camera business we have right now is the body-worn business which is relatively small percentage of our revenue. ","Paul Silverstein","I don\u2019t know if this where to look but from a cursory look at the numbers, it looks like Avigilon doesn\u2019t break out hardwares and software they do one number. Any insight you can share with us in terms of that revenue stream, you're going to be bringing on how much of that its software versus the body cams. ","Gregory Brown","I think Paul, we really for that, we will get more detail at TAM and when we close and we will just aggregate it a bit more. ","Paul Silverstein","But one last question if I may, it seems to be going so well, in terms of the greatest variables levers for better or worse as you look at '18 and beyond, I trust it's on the revenue line. You have done such a good job with OpEx, and it sounds like gross margin there is not a lot of room either way. If in fact it is revenue, what would be the variables that could drive significant upside or downside in the most prominent ones. ","Gregory Brown","I would answer it this way, I mean I think we're pretty prudent to begin within in the way we guide the firm in Q1 in an annualized basis. You can never can tell of course but I think we pretty effectively risk adjusted our thinking around Q1 and the full year, both from a revenue standpoint and an EPS standpoint. ","I'm particularly comforted by the performance of the record backlog and the composition of the aged backlog that Gino referenced being higher going into '18 then '17. The environment is strong right now, geopolitically, we grew in every region and it looks like we have the opportunity to grow in every region again. And we're anchored by North America which continually performs very strongly.","Second, I think I really like the performance in the low end LMR business what we also refer to as the commercial markets group. I think Molloy's team and Brda product team have performed exceptionally well there. And were executing quite well, I mean we made changes on people, we've moved more front facing bag carrying photo carrying people to the front lines, we continue to prudently manage OpEx and I think do it a better job globally around our channel management. Now that\u2019s not meant to be commercial, as there is lot more work to do, but I think the foundation of growth, the durability to earnings, the visibility we have in the business, positions us quite well for 2018. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. ","Ben Bollin ","First one, there is been some references to the better positioning of the age backlog. I know that you will give percentage of products and service backlog you expect to recognize; can you give us that percentage now?","And then my follow on, I know the company, it sounds like you've implemented a number of dedicated sales initiatives in the commercial end market pursuing specific verticals. Could you take us through a little bit of what you've done and if you feel like there's more opportunity where you could do that in other verticals or if you're seeing additional verticals come online beyond oil and gas and heavy industry, things like that? Thank you. ","Gregory Brown","And I\u2019ll take, this is Jack. I'll take the second half of the question related to commercial markets. I'll answer it by saying, when I previously led the North American business, I came in in 2015 and we had all of $7 million in total backlog in that market. We had a small team, I believe it was less than 10 people, they were appointed just really at oil and gas market, which as you know, is highly cyclical.","Subsequent to that, we have built a team that's gone after the utility market, which has been our highest performing market in commercial last two years in North America. A year ago, we scaled into transportation logistics and manufacturing and we've got a sizable team really and really, been really focused at the Fortune kind of 300 level. We think that's we play most and we've also got an incredible force multiplier in terms of our channel and they have done an outstanding job in covering the small midsize business for us in North America. ","Now pivot to internationally we've just stood up a commercial markets team, enterprise selling team in the Europe in the Middle East as well. Again, oil, a large manufacturing in the couriers, there is the target and so to your point, moving from just an oil and gas practice into really a multi, a manufacturing environment where really Bruce's portfolio scales quite well. So, I think, I feel pretty good about the coverage that we've built. And I do think Gino\u2026","Gino Bonanotte","We're, we're really not in a position to disclose any elements of the, of the K right now, but I wouldn't suspect anything surprising in the K, as I said, we're in a better age backlog position and that extends to both a products and services. ","Operator","Thank you. We'll go back to George Notter with Jeffries. Please go ahead. ","George Notter","Hey guys, thanks a lot so letting me follow up. I guess I want to ask about the managed services initiative, certainly its very interesting for you guys and that expands the TAM around your LMR business. I saw that it was up 17% this year. Can you just talk about some of the moving parts inside that initiative, what are customers saying, what's receptivity look like, how does the pitch kind of work for them? Thanks A lot.","Jack Molloy","George, it's Jack. So, a good question, by the way, Kelly Mark leads our global managed and support service business. I think Kelly has done a great job. So, here\u2019s really, if there's really an inflection point in the market that we've seen, this exists, in the last, kind of call it five to six years, historically, a good deal of our customers maintains their own network and think about these are labor union employees, they come at a pretty significant cost to the employee base. ","And it was really an analog world we supplied our own parts essentially supplied all the parts around systems. The world through P25 is pivoted to really IT based networks, a lot of third party components which has driven the sophistication and frankly the complexity of the networks, which is opened the door for us because they're so they're quite sophisticated to maintain. ","The other part of it is this whole thing about having 24-hour, 24\/7 maintenance and more importantly potentially looking to move on to statewide network off just having regional control your network, which has really opened the door from managed services as well. We\u2019ve invested knocks around the world network operations centers and so really frankly it's been a long slog in terms of North America and it's been an organic story but around the world we've also gone out as Greg and Gino outlined and acquired operators as well but all in every region grows, every region from managing supports centered will not only grow but as we kind said before grow in the mid to high single digits. ","George Notter","And can you tell me what percentage of the services business that might account for now, just as a curiosity.","Jack Molloy","40% approximately 40% to 45%. ","Operator","Certainly, our final question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. ","Keith Housum ","Just a little house keeping here, in terms of the share repurchase program that you guys have, obviously some cash news at the pension contribution and the Avigilon acquisition is there any thoughts in terms of what your share repurchase activity will be in FY'18. ","Gregory Brown","As we said, good question Keith. As now that we're kind normalized the balance sheet, the capital allocation framework is we suggest it would be 50% cash flow used for either share repurchase or M&A. Given that we plan to close, PlantCML in Q1 and Avigilon sometime in Q2 we're using cash on hand as well as short-term debt to fund the Avigilon acquisitions, so as a result our plan on share repurchase is very little in 2018 probably about a 75 million this year and that\u2019s just to cover dilution but the remaining capital will be deployed, the remaining cash will be deployed to close those acquisitions. ","Keith Housum ","Great make sense, and then if I seek one more here, R&D popped up here in the fourth quarter but that going forward or is just little more opportunity to invest in R&D this quarter versus what you expect for '18. ","Gregory Brown","I wouldn\u2019t interrupt at one thing or another really it's probably really more just opportunistic although overall from an OpEx standpoint as Gino mentioned earlier we expect to drive OpEx down even further in '18 and that\u2019s inclusive of acquisitions that have been completed already which has 20 million OpEx that becomes with it and it includes the 30 million headwinds from foreign exchange. So, we will continue to do what we need to do, surgically but impact fully around OpEx. ","Gino Bonanotte","George one point of correction, managed support services is a part of the overall composition services is not 45 its actually 65 or two third of that revenue. ","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Chris Kutsor, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks.","Chris Kutsor","Thank you.

Mr. Dunlap, you may begin.","Shep Dunlap - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Good afternoon. Welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are Greg Brown, Chairman and CEO; Gino Bonanotte, Executive Vice President and CFO; Bruce Brda, Executive Vice President, Products and Services; and Jack Molloy, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales. Greg and Gino will review our results along with commentary, and Bruce and Jack will join for Q&A.","We have posted an earnings presentation and news release at motorolasolutions.com\/investor. These materials include GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for your reference. A number of forward-looking statements will be made during this presentation during the Q&A portion of the call. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause such differences can be found in this afternoon's earnings news release and the comments made during this conference call and the Risk Factors section of our 2015 annual report on Form 10-K and in other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Greg.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Shep. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us today. I'd like to make a few opening comments about the first quarter and the overall business before Gino takes us through the results and the outlook. First, Q1 was a good quarter relative to our sales and earnings expectations. North America continues to execute well with growth of 2% including increases in both products and services sales along with encouraging order activity.","Second, our focus around growing the Managed and Support Services franchise continues to build momentum. We grew Managed and Support Services 6% organically in Q1, closed Airwave, added $1.8 billion to our backlog position, and made significant progress in streamlining and packaging our Services and Support offerings.","And last, we continue to build a leaner and more agile organization as we drive further operational efficiency. There are a number of examples that illustrate this change, including the completed sale of our Malaysian manufacturing facility, a 40% reduction in product SKUs in a little over a year and a targeted shift in R&D to strategic growth areas.","I'll now turn the call over to Gino to provide additional details on Q1 results and outlook before returning to provide some closing thoughts.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Greg. Key Q1 results include revenue of $1.2 billion, down 2% versus last year and down 1% in constant currency. Airwave revenue was $61 million. GAAP operating earnings were $100 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $166 million or 13.9% of sales, representing a 110 basis point improvement from the year-ago quarter. EBITDA grew $20 million to $215 million. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.10 compared to $0.40 in the first quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.52 which represents a 37% year-over-year increase. This earnings growth was driven primarily by ongoing cost reduction and further optimizing our capital structure.","Ending backlog is up $2.5 billion versus last year and up $1.9 billion sequentially. Of the $2.5 billion year-on-year increase, Airwave accounts for $1.8 billion. Managed and Support Services backlog is up $700 million, and Product is up $30 million. The $1.9 billion sequential increase was primarily due to Airwave, Managed and Support Services, and a $32 million increase in Product. For the remainder of the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted.","Moving to the Product segment, Q1 Product sales were $702 million, down 7% versus the prior year. The decline was primarily due to weakness in Latin America and Europe as well as currency headwinds. Q1 Product segment operating income was $84 million or 12% of sales, up 10 basis points versus last year as a result of the ongoing cost reduction actions. Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, up $30 million versus last year and up $32 million sequentially, driven by North America. Product backlog has grown in seven of the past eight quarters.","Turning to Services, Q1 Service revenue was $491 million, up 6%. Excluding the $61 million of Airwave sale, Services declined 8% primarily on systems integration related to Norway as well as a decline in iDEN. The focus growth area of Managed and Support Services grew 6% organically. Inclusive of Airwave, Managed and Support Services now represents approximately 25% of our total revenue. Services operating income was $82 million or 16.7% of revenue, up $16 million from the prior year.","Operating margins increased 250 basis points on improved gross margin and lower OpEx. Services backlog ended at $7.1 billion, up $2.5 billion versus last year and up $1.8 billion sequentially. The $2.5 billion of backlog growth versus last year is attributable to $1.8 billion of Airwave in EMEA and $500 million of Managed and Support Services in North America.","Moving to operating expenses, total OpEx from continuing operations was $354 million, down $43 million or 11% from the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by continued cost reduction activities. For the year, we continue to expect savings of approximately $120 million, including the addition of the OpEx related to Airwave. Other income and expense in Q1 was $42 million compared to $37 million in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expense was $49 million in Q1 compared to $40 million last year.","Moving to taxes, the Q1 effective tax rate was 26%. We continue to expect the full year 2016 effective tax rate to be approximately 33%.","Turning to cash flow, Q1 operating cash flow was $13 million, a decrease of $143 million. Free cash flow was a use of $38 million. The lower operating cash flow was the result of higher incentive payments and higher tax payments, while working capital was a smaller source of cash than last year. We remain on track for approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of operating cash flow and $4.75 to $5 of free cash flow per share for the full year. We ended Q1 in a net debt position of $3.1 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased $64 million of stock at $71.41. The lower buyback levels in Q1 were primarily due to the Airwave transaction.","In total, we have repurchased $11 billion of shares at an average price of $57.13 and have approximately $1 billion remaining on our current authorization. Finally, dividend payments were $71 million for the quarter.","Now, turning to the outlook, we expect Q2 sales growth of 1% to 3%. Airwave revenue is expected to be approximately $130 million. We expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS between $0.82 and $0.88. Our view of the full year 2016 outlook remains unchanged at 5% to 7% sales growth. We also expect non-GAAP EPS of $4.45 to $4.65. Airwave is expected to be approximately $450 million in revenue.","Moving to regional results, North America grew 2%, driven by both Products and Services demand. Demand for both Managed and Support Services as well as APX device sales were key growth drivers in North America. Backlog growth was once again very strong in Services with an increase of approximately $500 million from last year. Additionally, Product backlog was up $23 million sequentially. We remain on track for growth for the year.","Latin America was down 42% on continued challenging macroeconomic conditions, the impact of a stronger dollar and iDEN declines. While the macro environment has clearly impacted the channel business and demand for large systems, our overall margins within the region remain solid. We have adjusted sales coverage on key accounts and continue to support our partners and customers during the downturn. EMEA was up 1% inclusive of $61 million of Airwave revenues, offset by declines associated with the Norway project, pockets of channel weakness, and currency headwinds.","Asia-Pac declined by 4% on currency headwinds and expected softness in China. Excluding currency, Asia-Pac grew 1% with a strong quarter of Managed and Support Services revenue growth.","I'd also like to share some brief segment highlights. In our Product segment, some of the notable awards won during the quarter include a $42 million contract with Montgomery County, Maryland to upgrade their P25 network to the latest release, a $23 million contract in Central Africa for a nationwide P25 system, a $25 million order with a North African nation for our latest MOTOTRBO trunking solution, and we won another Public Safety LTE contract with the United Nations for a deployable LTE system and devices.","Highlights from our Services business include the award of a significant and strategic contract in the U.K. to provide WAVE 7000 interoperability between the existing Airwave LMR network and the new ESN LTE network when operational. We won a large multi-year maintenance and software upgrade contract with a large U.S. utility customer that utilizes our full suite of services. And finally, our Smart Public Safety momentum continues with strong double-digit revenue growth and continued innovation. New offerings include CommandCentral software to help public safety in the command and control center with real-time operational views, situational awareness in the field, and improved decision-making.","New wins in Smart Public Safety includes several Emergency CallWorks awards that bring next generation 911 capabilities to public safety answering points.","I would now like to turn the call back over to Greg.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Gino, thanks. Let me close with a few thoughts. First, Q1 was a good start to the year in terms of delivering on our sales plan and maintaining momentum in North America and our Managed and Support Services business that we believe will be key growth engines for us in the coming years. Second, we remain acutely focused on delivering significant earnings growth and free cash flow per share increases for full year 2016 and beyond.","And finally, our teams continue to make good progress on our growth in innovation initiatives. While there's plenty of work that remains to be done, I'm pleased with the underlying trends we're seeing in our backlog growth and recurring revenues. While the team is streamlining and strengthening our services portfolio, improving sales coverage, adding key commercial vertical resources, optimizing channel efficiency, and making the right targeted investment areas in such as Smart Public Safety and software.","And I'll now turn the call back over to Shep so we can then it open up for questions.","Shep Dunlap - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Greg. Before we begin taking questions, I'd like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and a follow-up so we can accommodate as many participants as possible. Operator, would you please remind our callers on the line how to place a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hello. Can you hear me?","Shep Dunlap - Vice President-Investor Relations","We can hear you, Kulbinder.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks. A question first of all for Greg. I guess just in terms of the priorities for MSI in terms of delivering organic revenue growth, when do you think that's going to be? I'm just thinking \u2013 I know there's been lots of impacts over the last couple of years, narrowbanding currency, macro and all the different factors. From where we are now just for the overall organization to organically start growing the top line, is that a priority? Is that something we see as we get to the back half of the year? What drives it? Could you speak a little bit about that, please?","And then basically for Gino, just on Airwave, can you maybe just help me understand how quickly the revenues tail off for that business? I assume at some point it will. But I have never got a clear understanding as to, is it after two years or three years or four years? What's the financial dynamics of that acquisition? Thanks.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Kulbinder. So from an outlook standpoint, a couple of points. Q1 over-performed against our expectations. I'd say that was largely driven by North America to kind of frame that. Second point I'd make is for the first half of our view of the year, I think it's entirely consistent with our expectations a quarter ago, and we're maintaining our outlook for the full year. From an organic perspective, we expect growth in the second half of this year organically, segregating out Airwave.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Kulbinder, on the Airwave question, the current contracts are extended through 2019. And at that point in time, based on the ESN rollout, we'll determine how much longer they go beyond that.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And, Gino, just to clarify one thing on that point, though, is there an opportunity as you bring product solutions to that customer that this could extend to be a multi-year business beyond it? Or is it uncertain at this time? Or I'm trying to understand the longevity even beyond that perhaps.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Kulbinder. I'll start and perhaps some of the other folks might want to jump in. When we look at the U.K. Home Office and Public Safety in the U.K., we've had a relationship for decades regardless of technology. We expect that relationship to continue regardless of technology. Throughout technology upgrades, service offerings, we've maintained a great relationship with the Home Office and with Public Safety, and we expect to continue that and expect that to go beyond Airwave and ESN.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And just to add a specific piece of color, since both the Airwave transaction has closed and the order for ESN, we received a significant order from the U.K. Home Office for a piece of software that will provide interoperability between LMR, Land Mobile Radio, and LTE and that's a new contract that we got just this past quarter. So I think things are progressing well and we're well-positioned.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thanks. Very clear. Thank you.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kulbinder.","Operator","We go next to Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you both for taking my question. I was just wondering about like your performance in the U.S., 2% organic growth and also all the comments you have made about your backlog both in Services and in Product. So is it fair to say that this growth is more on the low end than the high end of the kind of growth you expect from the region going forward? And in particular, if I look at the second half, it looks like \u2013 so as you've said, you expect organic growth to come back. And based on your guidance, I get the feeling it could be more than 2% organic growth. And in that picture, would the U.S. accelerate, or do you expect growth to come back mostly from international markets? Thank you.","Jack P. Molloy - Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales","Pierre, good evening. It's Jack. So I guess a couple comments. When you think about Q1, we had both Product and Services growth in North America. I think that's an important point. We also grew the Managed and Support Services 9%. And as you alluded to, our backlog was up $575 million, again, primarily driven by Managed and Support Services, but we grew both segments.","If you think about 2016 in total, as we said, we'll grow the North American business. It continues to be a good environment for both state and local and the federal business for us. A couple things to think about is we've improved sales coverage, so we're starting to see some return on that. And then we're also \u2013 we've gone into better data analytics in terms of our ability to target and capture additional software features on the equipment that we sell, the products that we sell. So again, as we said, we expect to grow in North America in 2016.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. And maybe a quick follow-up specifically on the comment that Gino made on your Product backlog that has been up like for six quarters or seven quarters in a row. What does a Product backlog mostly relate to? Is that like a handsets backlog or is that more infrastructure or features, and what's the typical duration of your backlog on the Product side?","Jack P. Molloy - Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales","Yeah, so, Pierre, our backlog as we see it today has trended more towards devices. We've certainly seen particularly in Q1. In the back half of 2015, our mix has really gone to devices over infrastructure. But I will add that we've obviously seen with the backlog growth, we've seen the return of some large scale projects. State of Iowas and those kind of deals. So it's a pretty good mix as we said. Big growth in Services, some growth in devices as well.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Gino, I don't have anything to add on that.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The only thing I'll add, Jack, is from a duration perspective, clearly the Managed and Support Services is a longer duration, multi-year contract. Product is typically a shorter duration, although in Products we could have system deployment that would extend several quarters.","Shep Dunlap - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, please?","Operator","Okay. We'll go next to Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. First, I guess you mentioned it, but maybe a little more explanation on what's going on in EMEA. I think if you back out the Airwave revenues, it was down like mid-20s percentage year-over-year. So maybe just a little more detail there. And then kind of bigger picture on the revenue this year, if I look at Q1 and the Q2 guidance, it looks like your growth rate ex-Airwave will be down 7% or 8% in the first half of the year. Can you give us a bridge to what gives you the confidence for turning that around to something that looks like it needs to be kind of low to mid-single digit organic growth in the back half of the year? Thanks.","Jack P. Molloy - Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales","Okay. Hey, Tavis. It's Jack. So I guess in regards to EMEA first, obviously Q1 was up 4% ex-currency, but when you look at the business organically, obviously we were down 26% in EMEA. And a large part of that is due to the fact of our Norway, the integration runoff and the comps there. We also saw a decline in devices. The other piece of it is if you think about EMEA, we've had some pockets of weakness in the channel at the low end, particularly in Europe. But again, we continue to see \u2013 I mean, when you start to think about the region in 2016, we'll see continued pressure in the first half with the runoff of Norway as well as FX. Gino, I don't know if you have anything you want to add as it relates to the second part of the question.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the second part of the question being confidence in...","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In the full year second half.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...in the full year. So if we look at our backlog aged into the second half, it's comparable to what it was last year, Tavis, and clearly in the first half, the first half Latin America specifically, Q1 and Q2 have been hit hard from a year-over-year perspective. If we look at what happened last year in Latin America, Q1 and Q2 were reasonable quarters and really the falloff happened in Q3 and Q4. So a combination of order activity, increasing backlog, and visibility that we have into the second half give us confidence for the \u2013 the expectation isn't for significant growth rates in the second half, but certainly better than performance in the first half.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then if I could ask a follow-up for you, Gino, on kind of the same topic but on the cash flow statement. So I know cash flow normally ramps throughout the year but you're starting from a pretty low base this year in Q1 2016. So is there anything that held cash flow back this particular quarter that should reverse or anything else we should be aware of as we try to get to $1.1 billion of operating cash for the full year?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, a couple things to think about, Tavis. Q1 2015 was abnormally high. As you know, Q1 is typically our smallest quarter due to timing of some of the receivables. And if you look at our trailing 12-month, we're ahead of where we were the prior year. So really we were expecting cash flow to be lower in Q1. It was driven by higher incentive payments for 2015 performance versus 2014 variable pay payments that the majority of which are paid out in Q1 and higher tax payments. And working capital, working capital was a source of cash in Q1 2016, just not as large of a source as it was in Q1 of 2015. As a matter of fact, from a cash conversion cycle, we improved four days in the quarter. So we still expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion for the full year and free cash flow per share of $4.75 to $5.","Tavis C. McCourt - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Gino, as I look at the Services gross margin and really gross margins overall, it seems like they're perhaps a little bit lower than what we expected with the Airwave acquisition. Is there anything in the Services gross margins that we should be looking at?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So if we look at Services, as you mentioned, the Services gross margin were up year-over-year based on the Norway roll-off. We talked about Services gross margin getting back to that mid-30s percentage as our run rate and that did happen. What happened in Q1 were really three things. There was an FX impact, a volume impact on the product side, and a mix shift from product to services. As Services grew 6%, products contracted 7%. Those are really the three items that impacted Q1 margin. For the full year, we continue to expect full year gross margin to be comparable to last year. You mentioned Airwave. Airwave does have a little bit lower gross margin than our base business. But again, our expectation for the full year are gross margins comparable to what they were in 2015.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. And thinking \u2013 I'll ask one quick follow-up after that. Share repurchases were a lot lower than we expected. Now, understandably you guys couldn't buy back anything until Airwave acquisition was closed. Should we think about the share prices now you guys are going to be a little bit more opportunistic or is the thought process you're still going to buy aggressively?","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So we remain committed to return of capital. There's no change to the model. There's no change to the assumption of how much cash we need on the balance sheet to run the business. So for planning purposes, the expectation of $750 million to $1 billion of share buyback is still valid for planning purposes.","Keith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take the next question from George Notter with Jefferies.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks a lot, guys. It feels like you've got a fair amount of momentum right now in the Managed Services business even excluding the Airwave piece. But I guess I'd love to just ask you more broadly about the environment for Managed Services deals and are municipalities and states and other organizations now more open to those kinds of business models as opposed to owning and operating networks? And talk about what kind of changes you're seeing there? Thanks.","Bruce Brda - Executive Vice President-Systems & Products","Hey. Thanks, George. This is Bruce Brda. We have seen an increase in the Managed Services business, primarily driven by a couple of things. Number one, the smoothing of cash flows, spend from our customers' perspective; second, and maybe more importantly, is the complexity of the networks are increasing on an ongoing basis. Our customers don't have the resources or the capabilities to manage a lot of those. And so we have seen both an increase in what we would consider support and managed, so long software upgrade agreements and multi-year support plans. And that's driven largely by North America, but also seen around the entire globe.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Ashwin on behalf of Rod. I have one clarification, and a question. Based on your comments, revenue performance in Q1 and the guidance for Q2, it appears like some of the revenue has got pulled forward into Q1. Could you clarify if that's right? And is that the reason why your full year outlook has not changed? And then my question is on backlog. Could you update us on how much revenue do you expect to recognize from backlog this year now that you have integrated Airwave?","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, on the first one, you're right. I think that we over-performed in Q1 against our original expectations. That was largely driven by North America. So in Q2, our guidance, we think, is prudent. Obviously, we're holding the full year in Q2 specifically we have pressure from Latin America of probably about another $40 million, the roll-off of Norway of about $30 million. And to your point, probably some revenue that we would originally have thought would have appeared in Q2 slid to Q1. When you net all those ingredients, it's entirely first half and full year as we expected.","Backlog.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, with respect to the backlog question, as I mentioned earlier, we're approximately at the same position we were comparable to last year, aged in the year from a backlog perspective. And with respect to Airwave, the incremental $1.8 billion we have talked about a $450 million Airwave number. So clearly that $450 million would come out of the $1.8 billion of Airwave backlog.","Ashwin X. Kesireddy - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andrew Spinola with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I just wanted to ask you, you'd given the amount of activity in international markets in Public Safety LTE, specifically in TETRA markets. I'm wondering if you guys have seen any impact on your infrastructure business in TETRA or any impact at all on those markets from the potential shift to LTE in some of these countries.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I'll let Jack Molloy expand, but we haven't. As we have mentioned with LTE, in the four largest engagements that have been awarded in the world so far, we won all four: Los Angeles, two countries in the Middle East, and the U.K. But simultaneously, we see continued investment in LMR even with those LTE awards. We think that LTE is additive to LMR. We're seeing increased interest between the interoperability between LMR and LTE, hence the award I mentioned from the U.K. Home Office in Q1. So, no, we don't see any chilling effect on TETRA infrastructure in international markets as a result of LTE consideration.","Jack P. Molloy - Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales","The one thing that I would add to that is the situation in the U.K. was unique in that they did not own either their spectrum or their network. So they had a different decision than really every other customer we have or we serve around the globe. To the best of my knowledge, they're the only customer in the world that didn't own spectrum or network and again had a different set of options presented to them than any other customer we have with the TETRA network.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. And just a follow-up on that, what would be your expectations of investments in infrastructure now that you own the Airwave asset?","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Specifically to Airwave, Andrew?","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, since you own the business, what kind of investments in infrastructure do you foresee making between now and 2019 in that business?","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Minimal, minimal CapEx in that business, Andrew.","Andrew C. Spinola - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Shep Dunlap - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew DeGasperi with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Andrew DeGasperi - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. First, I guess can you maybe give us an idea on when you think China might turn around and grow again? And then secondly, with FX stabilizing in Latin America and being such a small part of your revenue now, do you think the worst is over and that you think \u2013 you see that region growing again too?","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In terms of China, first of all, we had one of our strongest years ever that I can remember in China last year. But China was down about 25% in Q1 off of a high compare and some lumpiness in strong order activity. I think it will be down probably 20% or 25% for the full year. So we are not expecting any growth in China. Instead, we are expecting contraction of about 25% this year for the remainder.","Jack P. Molloy - Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales","Andrew, I guess maybe a couple comments on LatAm. So I think the first point that I think is important, if you think about LatAm as a region, it's 5% of MSI's total revenues.","The second thing I would say is, to your point, when we think about the first half of the year, we were down 42% in Q1. Most of the pressure from a comparables perspective does reside and is the challenge for us in the first half of 2016. But I would really say, having obviously spent a good portion of time in the region that if the situation remains fluid, both from, I think, a natural commodities perspective and a macroeconomic perspective. Some countries are faring better than others, but it remains a challenge.","I will say the one bright spot is we remained, and we will sustain our investment in the region both from a go-to-market and from a technical resource because we do believe the market will rebound again. It's just tough to really put your finger on exactly when that will happen right now.","Andrew DeGasperi - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Yeah, hi, Greg, Gino. A question and a follow-up. The question is on heading into the back half with all of the change of guard, the drama we are seeing with the U.S. elections, would you see any impact at all with any of your business with the Fed agencies or even with state and local with elections and change of guard? Thanks.","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Vijay, I guess a comment. We don't really \u2013 no, we don't necessarily see anything with the federal elections that will impact our business in the federal market. Demand really post-2013 has been pretty stable, pretty solid in our business, and really that's across the continuum for both Product and Services. So, no, we don't anticipate any impact or any slowdown as it relates to the upcoming election in our business in the federal market.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very helpful. A quick follow-on for Gino in terms of OpEx heading into the back half. From a modeling point of view, give us some idea as how should we look into OpEx for the remainder of the year. Thanks","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, Vijay, we said $120 million total reduction year-over-year, and we did $43 million in Q1. So the modeling for the back half of the year, the first half will be a little bit more from a reduction perspective than the second half. And remember, the $120 million is a $120 million reduction year-over-year after the addition of approximately $30 million of Airwave OpEx. So really the reduction and the base business is approximately $150 million year-over-year.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Gopal Mehta - Cowen and Company","Hey, guys. This is Gopal Mehta for Paul. Two questions. One is a quick clarification. On the organic growth revenue, did I hear you guys correctly that you expect the organic growth for full year, or was that just for second half?","Greg Brown - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Just for second half.","Gopal Mehta - Cowen and Company","Second half. Okay. And then the second was if you could give us some quantitative color on those \u2013 some of the big wins you guys mentioned and how that translates to the backlog.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So it really depends on the awards. They're different. Certainly, the Services award would be aged over several years. They're multi-year awards. System deployment would likely be aged over several quarters, and then there was some APX subscriber backlog that would be realized as revenue in 2016.","Gopal Mehta - Cowen and Company","Got it. Thank you.","Gino A. Bonanotte - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure.","Operator","It appears we have no further questions at this time. I'll return the floor back to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President of Investor Relations, for any additional or closing remarks.","Shep Dunlap - Vice President-Investor Relations","No. Thanks. We appreciate everybody joining us today and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.
